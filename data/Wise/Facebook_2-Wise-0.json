The stock option process is that your manager has 10 days at the beginning of the quarter to start the stock option grant process and get it approved by specific people.

The number of the stock options in your grant depends on the stock price of the previous quarter. The stock price has doubled in the past 3 months, so employees who didn't get their stock options grant approved in time last month will get half the number of the stock options they were promised, in addition to not receiving stock options this quarter. Because of this, a fair number of people lost dozens of thousands of dollars. When this happens, no one will let you know that you're not getting your stock options. If you ask, the company will let you know that this is the company policy and that they have planned to change the way stock option grants work. It's been one year that the stock option grants are supposed to change in 2 quarters. It's still supposed to change in 2 quarters. - Each team gets the same budget for the pay increases (percentage-wise) and the team impact and performance doesn't matter. - A lot of smart people left.

Appraisals leading to pay increments are only conducted once a year after winter regardless of join date, for a mere two hundred dollars increment.

Also, salary is lower than other companies pay to their employees in the same field, the excuse is that employees get shares, which is a fair point."}, {"review_title": "Good learning experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Mar 2023", "job_title": "AML/KYC Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "a lot of flexibility in picking projects that are relevant to the team", "cons": "work can be intellectually challenging at times"}, {"review_title": "Wise is a fantastic place to work, everyone is so friendly.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Workplace Coordinator in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone here has time to help you and advise you on how to do things at Wise.

Hiring: It is relatively easy to get hired as the company is growing very fast, and HR hires people with zero experience in the field. I think it is good that they evaluate your common sense and soft skills and don't just focus on relevant professional experience. This allows students and graduates to start a career somewhere with good pay easily. It is not too hard to grow within the company starting in CS, because they prefer to hire internally. Growth: Continuous development is the primary goal of the company, so they do not get stuck in old and useless habits, but it does mean a lot of changes almost weekly that you have to keep up with. Community: The company puts a lot of effort into community building, so you will have the chance to go to really fun team events monthly, and attend team lunches and brunches on alternating weeks, we usually have pizza and cake in the office, and they consider dietary requirements. We have Wise days and mission days, parties on boats and in private clubs, and so on. The office space itself is amazing with so many facilities. Gym, sauna, kitchens with free food, fun area, living room, lots of spacious and well-equipped desks, and more. It is quite easy to make friends, everybody is super approachable and nice, and the office culture is indeed extraordinary. Overall: If you align with the company's mission, it feels good that you know you are working towards a great goal and that your efforts are not in vain.", "cons": "Scheduling: The shift division is not ideal, you do not know your shift until like 4 days before the next month starts, so it is tough to plan your personal life around it. You can be scheduled for any time, sometimes starting at 7 am, sometimes finishing at 11 pm (but the company does consider if you are a student or parent, though they don't consider anyone entirely in between. You will have to do weekend shifts. With the new scheduling system, you will have to be doing phones for 5.5 hours a day- and Wise gets an insane amount of complaints and angry customers, so it is emotionally draining. Crisis handling: There is a new crisis or incident every second week and management acts like it's the first time something like that happens, so the customers do not get a solution to their issue for days or sometimes weeks. Of course, the customer support agents left in the dark become the punching bag of the angry customers. Once a customer complained that working with Wise feels like working with a bunch of college dropouts, and that pretty much summarises it - many of us are college dropouts. Pay: The other employees in the Estonian office earn 1.5-2 times more (in euros) for the same hours in the same role than the Hungarian team, and that is because the company is profiting from the insane inflation in Hungary. They have literally admitted to this. You basically have to fight and beg for a ridiculously small benchmarking raise. The work: The role involves so much more than just regular CS. You have to do the complaint handling (several a month), you do all the escalations to other teams ( you have to figure out who to escalate to, which is usually not evident), and you will be scheduled t give extra training the new agents because they receive 3 weeks of training, but there is so much knowledge to learn that most people don't get into the flow until 3-4 months in.

This team look after ALL the creative work and are extremely defensive about it. To the extent that the copy team aren't even trusted to create the copy for e.g. a product video for paid social or run their own messaging tests. Copywriters are seen as nothing more than as 'content writers' so if you're a creative copywriter, do NOT come and work here. Your creative copy skills will go nowhere as they don't see you as worth investing in / deserving of any creative briefs and you'll spend your days going in circles with people who pretend to listen but don't really, are completely unmoveable and will block anything they see as an infringement of what their team should do. Prepare yourself for feeling exasperated, depressed, and having sleepless nights.

But of course, our annual salary review was postponed over and over again. We literally had to fight for it, and in the end they told us that we made good enouh money already, we didn't need a raise. We kept pushing it however, arguing for at least compensation for inflation. After almost a year of waiting and fighting, they agreed to give us a 10% raise for the inflation.

When I joined, it was more (but still modest compared to other actors in the field): diverse breakfast in the morning, generous stock options, monthly pass for public transport. Then they took them away one by one, leaving us with literally nothing, and a slim stock option package for new joiners. In the middle of the pandemic, not only did I not receive any of the above benefits, Wise diverted its own costs at the employees by not giving any subsidy for home office. Oh wait, they did: a one-time 25K HUF (80 USD) allowance to buy ourselves a chair or something, and this was rubbed in our faces over and over again as a token of their generosity.\r\n\r\n- Three time's the charm, so let me add one more to this happy family/taking you for an idiot streak. Benefits are not given at Wise, because of the stock options. Then Wise enters the stock market: the founders are now billionaires, the employees are happy too that they may be able to buy themselves a car, maybe even a flat. And then the co-founder sells the majority of his shares (he wasn't a billionaire enough I guess) causing the share price tumbling. Thanks to him, many of us had to say goodbye to bigger purchases as the stock prices haven't recovered at all. But I guess he can buy himself a second gold plated shark tank bar by the pool. It's also \"wise\" that Wise provides benefits in this highly volatile currency: stocks.\r\n\r\n- Other than the ones above here are some honorary mentions for cons: sweeping sexual harrasment cases under the rug; toxic positivity; microagression; lack of career path; lack of development options; nepotism; flat out lying (as others have also mentioned, though I'd add it's not only around firings but promotions too). \r\n\r\nI guess if you have to be a wageslave, working at Wise is not the worst option. But don't have any illusions, it's just another job to pay the bills and feed the kids."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Jun 2022", "job_title": "CS Associate in Tallinn", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Multicultural vibe.

After being offered the position we went through 5 weeks of training that was all initiated over Zoom.\nI was one among maybe 10 new hires that worked a 9-5 Mon- Fri shift. Training was broken up each week by a new group of trainers that used PowerPoints for the majority of training. The training was arduous. It\u2019s a banking job so there was hours upon hours of policies and procedures. Every other day we took a 10 question assessment, and each Friday we took a end of week wrap-up test. Trainers emphasized to all of us several times not to stress out on the assessments , to just do your best. If you failed a weekly quiz you could retake it until you passed. \n\nThe material was dense, and overwhelming at times. Trying to stay focused after hours of procedural training was a battle of attrition.  I got along w my teammates really well and their camaraderie made the stress of learning all the material go by quickly.\n\nAfter about 3 weeks our group separated into their respective roles with their managers and  new teams. From here I started to get more personalized training from my manager and team directly. We had a end of week assessment (the most difficult to date) and I needed a 80% to pass and only scored a 77%. I was told several different times that this was normal and that I would have the rest of the week to go over the material I got wrong and retake the test. \nBelieving that they had my interests in mind I relaxed my nerves and studied. When I took the  test again I scored a 100%, I knew the material that I had missed earlier inside and out. Later in the day my manager emailed me telling me to join him in a zoom room with his manager to discuss the test. It Seemed that my bosses manager didn\u2019t want me retaking the test where the questions were the same as my last test (which was odd because this has been the structure through all 5 weeks of training). \n\nI was told verbatim \u201cwe\u2019re going to give you a new test w different questions and you\u2019ll have 2 hours to complete it, but don\u2019t let it stress you out...even if you fail it we\u2019ll get you the proper help you need...so no worries....you won\u2019t get fired for failing a quiz\u201d. \n\nSo I was given a new test with all essay questions (all prior tests were multiple choice), and I did the best I could not being able to study any specific areas ahead of time. I received a 65% on my first attempt on the new test. Upset I emailed my manager and said \u201cI\u2019m feeling a lot of pressure w these assessments considering how I studied for and passed the last one only for it to be thrown out and a new test administered that I didn\u2019t prepare for. My manager responded telling me that it\u2019s ok, and he\u2019ll get w his manager to discuss a game plan for the future so that I\u2019m comfortable moving forward...mind you by this time I was in week 5 and actively working cases and sending emails and communicating w clients.\n\nThe next morning I was called into a zoom room with both managers plus an HR rep. My manager asked if my day was going well and I responded yes....then his manager briefly went over some of the questions I got wrong on my last test. Once she finished w/o missing a beat the HR rep said \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to part ways with you, you\u2019re not a good fit for the company right now \u201c. Needless to say I was shocked, and assessing the tone of the meeting they had already made up their minds even after saying all trainers and employees I worked with had nothing but good things to say about me, they didn\u2019t want to engage in any type of discussion. \n\nSo my advice to anyone whose hired: take what they tell you w a grain of salt. I was told the assessments wouldn\u2019t get you fired (several times)...that was a lie.

This means other teams treat you like you are at the bottom of the food chain. Nobody cares about the work you do, except your team lead. He, or most likely she (80% of CS team leads are women), will pretend they care. Back in the days they used to have 10 phone hours per month to help customers, now they don't even touch communications with clients. Team leads spend their days \"planning\" the future and thinking how to make you more efficient. If you received a manger call \u2013 you have to spend ages finding another CS agent who will pretend to be a manager.\r\n\r\n-\tCareer progression is unlikely, unless you are one of cool kids or formed a friendship with a hiring manager. It doesn\u2019t matter how many years you\u2019ve worked in the company. All depends on whether a team lead likes you and whether they hear things they want to hear during an interview. I\u2019ve seen really talented people not getting a job they\u2019ve done tremendous amount of work for \u2013 that\u2019s normal when it comes to CS in TransferWise. Wrong people get promoted for no reason. Also, most non-CS positions are opened to external hiring. Oh, and if your team lead feels you are not performing as well as you should be, you will not get a permission to apply anywhere.\r\n\r\n-\tToxic \"feedback culture\". A lot of people in the company don\u2019t know how to give feedback and how to receive it. Even if you did something that wasn\u2019t your fault, I recommend to say \u201cthank you\u201d and suck it up. Don\u2019t give a feedback to your team lead \u2013 most of them have a big ego and you will regret it at some stage.\r\n\r\n-\tPerformance requirements constantly changing. One month you may find yourself doing a good job, the next month your team lead is telling you it is not enough because it is based on some new \u201csmart\u201d metric.\r\n\r\n-\tInterviews for internal applications for other positions are often done by amateurs who are not really interested in you as a candidate.

Do not believe it. They will show you the table soccer, pool table, workout room... You will never have a minute to use any of them, these are just for show-off. All sorts of free food in the office, once a week company lunch, breakfast, coffee, coke products and fruit are free every day. Until you have COVID and this all goes to nil, you work from home office, you get NOTHING, no perks, no transport pass, no cafeteria. You are being closely watched all the time, especially by your team lead. The team leads are generally twenty-something year old young girlscouts, who might be well versed in technical knowledge valid only if you work there, but absolutely incapable of humanely carry the role of leading people and dealing with real persons, especially of older ages. They will never protect you, or curious about your side of the story, but will help telling you off and discipline you for out-of-the-team claims. Team leads have the tendency to pick and promote freshly hired girls to team lead level, those with whom they find appealing. If someone is not promoted by the end of their probation, then probably he/she will remain in the same position forever. Do not worry, this does not last a long time. Some people are put to personal improvement plan (PIP), which means they are basically looking for a good reason to fire the person. Sometimes it follows probation time right away, and as the PIP includes the option to be fired for underachievement if the desired results are not reached. The desired level is calculated by having tickets reviewed by the same scoutgirls, who do what their girlfriend team leads ask of them, and 85% is the pass rate. You can fail a ticket for simply not writing it in the manner the reviewer thinks it should have been written, and also for not filling in a statistics category for a ticket the way the reviewer thinks it should have been. During the PIP session, which lasts a short two months, you are heavily micromanaged, they know about your idle time, the time you spend with a customer, the time you spend by writing scripts about customer calls, what you do on the company laptop, EVERYTHING. As you are on PIP, it is like probation time never ends, you are being threatened to be fired constantly. The most stressful and disgusting part is when they tell you how everyone only wants to help you only (utter lie) they tell you they have a feedback culture, so feedback has to be received and given as HELP (even bigger lie). However, if you try to make a remark of criticizm, you will realize that the feedback culture is a one way street, you should welcome it but should not practice it. Everyone at the company is at a higher rank than customer agents. They claim there are no managers, as there is a flat company structure, but this is just another major lie, everyone is your superior at any team, and you are treated by most accordingly. YOu turn for help to one of the currency management teams, and all you get is public shaming, then when you retort, you get a warning. This time it is not your feedback anymore, but you have 'communication problems'. They say there is no lunchtime, so you spend eight hours working and that is it, lunchtime is included. This is a lie, as lunchtime is there if you can manage to perfom the required number of tickets and still have ten minutes to eat something. I have never given wrong information to any customer and had lots of thank you letters from grateful people, but this is not what Transferwise, and especially the team lead girlscouts want. The job itself can be done OK, although it is VERY stressful, I never felt so tired in my whole life. TransferWise was a HORRIBLE experience, with daily practiced hypocrisy, a little bit like when we had to pretend we believe in communism, where you were forced to show the belief of their lies and get ashamed and humiliated by a 20 year old team lead girl on a daily basis until she manages to get you fired for not performing above 85% constantly. The expected number of tickets per hour were harshly increased in 6 months, it was raise from 5 to 6 in an hour (definitely no time to get lunch or do a number two) and even the task of removing sensitive customer data from emails was assigned as an extra task, which equals with about the time of finishing a ticket in an hour. If you miss removing the data (like phone numbers) then the ticket fail the review. To top it all, your team lead talks to you about your upcoming sacking as if it was 'unfortunately' an event like losing an entrance test for a TV quiz.

Do not believe it. They will show you the table soccer, pool table, workout room... You will never have a minute to use any of them, these are just for show-off. All sorts of free food in the office, once a week company lunch, breakfast, coffee, coke products and fruit are free every day. Until you have COVID and this all goes to nil, you work from home office, you get NOTHING, no perks, no transport pass, no cafeteria. You are being closely watched all the time, especially by your team lead. The team leads are generally twenty-something year old young girlscouts, who might be well versed in technical knowledge valid only if you work there, but absolutely incapable of humanely carry the role of leading people and dealing with real persons, especially of older ages. They will never protect you, or curious about your side of the story, but will help telling you off and discipline you for out-of-the-team claims. Team leads have the tendency to pick and promote freshly hired girls to team lead level, those with whom they find appealing. If someone is not promoted by the end of their probation, then probably he/she will remain in the same position forever. Do not worry, this does not last a long time. Some people are put to personal improvement plan (PIP), which means they are basically looking for a good reason to fire the person. Sometimes it follows probation time right away, and as the PIP includes the option to be fired for underachievement if the desired results are not reached. The desired level is calculated by having tickets reviewed by the same scoutgirls, who do what their girlfriend team leads ask of them, and 85% is the pass rate. You can fail a ticket for simply not writing it in the manner the reviewer thinks it should have been written, and also for not filling in a statistics category for a ticket the way the reviewer thinks it should have been. During the PIP session, which lasts a short two months, you are heavily micromanaged, they know about your idle time, the time you spend with a customer, the time you spend by writing scripts about customer calls, what you do on the company laptop, EVERYTHING. As you are on PIP, it is like probation time never ends, you are being threatened to be fired constantly. The most stressful and disgusting part is when they tell you how everyone only wants to help you only (utter lie) they tell you they have a feedback culture, so feedback has to be received and given as HELP (even bigger lie). However, if you try to make a remark of criticizm, you will realize that the feedback culture is a one way street, you should welcome it but should not practice it. Everyone at the company is at a higher rank than customer agents. They claim there are no managers, as there is a flat company structure, but this is just another major lie, everyone is your superior at any team, and you are treated by most accordingly. YOu turn for help to one of the currency management teams, and all you get is public shaming, then when you retort, you get a warning. This time it is not your feedback anymore, but you have 'communication problems'. They say there is no lunchtime, so you spend eight hours working and that is it, lunchtime is included. This is a lie, as lunchtime is there if you can manage to perfom the required number of tickets and still have ten minutes to eat something. I have never given wrong information to any customer and had lots of thank you letters from grateful people, but this is not what Transferwise, and especially the team lead girlscouts want. The job itself can be done OK, although it is VERY stressful, I never felt so tired in my whole life. TransferWise was a HORRIBLE experience, with daily practiced hypocrisy, a little bit like when we had to pretend we believe in communism, where you were forced to show the belief of their lies and get ashamed and humiliated by a 20 year old team lead girl on a daily basis until she manages to get you fired for not performing above 85% constantly. The expected number of tickets per hour were harshly increased in 6 months, it was raise from 5 to 6 in an hour (definitely no time to get lunch or do a number two) and even the task of removing sensitive customer data from emails was assigned as an extra task, which equals with about the time of finishing a ticket in an hour. If you miss removing the data (like phone numbers) then the ticket fail the review. To top it all, your team lead talks to you about your upcoming sacking as if it was 'unfortunately' an event like losing an entrance test for a TV quiz. No, damn it, this is about putting me to the street in the middle of the pandemic - while they kept hiring newcomers. At times there were not enough tickets to work on, but nobody really cared or tried to help you.

There are people in the company that try very hard to make you feel good about working there but it is constantly overshadowed by the slow transition of becoming a corporation. One side wants you to be autonomous and be your own boss, everyone is free to choose their own path; whereas the management side is very strict in what you do, when you do it and how you do it. Creates a lot of mis-communication and lack of communication, where performance reviews might come as a surprise.\r\n- Customer Support positions are NOT only customer support positions - you have a chance to get/ask for extra responsibilities in the form of a side project. Why this is a con is because you are still evaluated as a Customer Support Agent and the extra responsibilities are in no way looked at when it comes down to your performance. The management does not understand what the employee actually does and they try to evaluate your work based on one single number. These extra responsibilities and the work you do might mean a lot for the company but again, if you ain't hitting that performance target that all Customer Support agents need to hit, then your contributions elsewhere are not taken into consideration.\r\n- These extra responsibilities can be actual positions in other companies but with TransferWise you still get the same pay as any other customer support agent. There are no bonuses for doing more than 100%, or for doing other extra work on the side for them.\r\n- No communication around the performance target that you need to hit. I had asked multiple times on how this target was calculated and I did not receive any proper analysis or work around it.

When People issues do crop up, they're taken seriously\r\n- Everyone is obsessed with the TransferWise mission from product through to CS.

Progression is based on merit, and in my experience hard work is rewarded\r\n- In most cases there is room to try new things and fail, as long as you demonstrate learnings\r\n- Everyone in the business is awarded share options, even at entry level\r\n- The founders and senior leadership team are hard working and committed to the mission 9 years on from the company being founded\r\n- It's a fun place to be!

Other than a base salary (typically lower than the industry) and share options (the future value of which in theory make up for the lower base salary) there are not other direct benefits such as private health / life insurance or pension plan.

If you hate politics, don't bother joining. It's as political as any big old organisation out there (or worse than most). \r\n\r\nMost leads are quite young and with that comes a huge ego. You will feel like going back to secondary school sometimes.

Anything that took 1 week anywhere else in TransferWise takes 4. Loads of talking, convincing and trying to understand a codebase that has become a huge patchwork of badly designed APIs, very little actual coding.  Code quality is average at most. Be prepared to deal with technical debt through the roof. Because the company grows so fast, most of the engineers know very little about the current codebase.  No documentation, no javadocs, just hearsay. \r\n\r\nLast but not least, the perks of being a vibrant startup are mostly gone by now. This is a huge organisation not a small startup anymore.

It's been about 5 months and I really enjoy my job, but I absolutely love the office and company culture, as well as the values which are actually lived, and not just marketing fluff. \r\n\r\nSo my pros are:\r\n- Super friendly/welcoming atmosphere & in-office camaraderie from day 1\r\n\r\n- Great mission that is actually helping everyday people. How many companies have a goal to make themselves obsolete for the benefit of their customers?\r\n\r\n- The benefits are exceptional for the US. I've never seen anyone else come close, benefits-wise here. INSANE amount of PTO (46 days, all in), insurance is low-cost & good coverage, 401k w/ match, sabbatical after 4 years, stock options, some company paid benefits too\r\n\r\n- Awesome regular team events & annual trip to Europe for Summer Days to keep everyone motivated & mission focused\r\n\r\n- Weekly catered team lunches + all kinds of breakfast food, fruit, & drinks/coffee free in the office for employees \r\n\r\n- The office is really cool (people say \"mini-Google\" all the time), dog-friendly, has a decent gym in the office, & flexible work opportunities (you are expected to be in the office 80% of the time though)\r\n\r\n- Autonomous team structure offers huge levels of autonomy, ownership, & responsibility, with no one looking over your shoulder, micromanaging you or endless red-tape/approvals to go through\r\n\r\n- Really transparent & feedback reliant culture that limits the drama & helps us move fast\r\n\r\n- Lots of opportunities to move up & around in the company & find what you really love, potentially within 6 months - year as we keep growing\r\n\r\n- Personally, I like that we don't have a dress code & everyone is encouraged to be themselves. Sometimes it's just a sweatpants & hoodie type of day\r\n\r\n- I'm always busy with my day-to-day responsibilities & additional side-projects, so I'm always stimulated & never bored\r\n\r\n- I love working for such a diverse, global company.

Very LGBT friendly & even the age range, experience, & education background of everyone is really broad and interesting\r\n\r\n- All the travel opportunities. So far, I've been to the New York & London offices, as well as Portugal for planning, with Budapest & Estonia trips in the near future (crossing my fingers for Singapore one day!) \r\n\r\n- Lots of support. Almost every chat with someone from my team includes \"what do you need help with?\" or \"How can we/I support you?\"\r\n\r\nI've never loved any place I've ever worked until now, so I don't say it lightly. This is by far the best experience of my professional career & I can't wait to see what the future holds as we grow. I will add though, that while travel opportunities are available for all positions in Tampa, my role requires more frequent travel (3 trips in 5 months so far), but that's not representative of all Tampa positions. Also, I'm a single US member on a global team spread across offices in 5 countries, so the levels of autonomy, ownership, and responsibility that I experience are even greater than some of the other teams in Tampa where the entire team is in the building. I just feel like those are fair comments to give context.", "cons": "I personally don't have any cons, but I'll share some fair comments and also some things that other people may consider cons. \r\n\r\n- You're not going to get rich at TransferWise. We pay median salaries which are fair, but not outstanding. We can't compete with Google or Facebook & we don't try to. We now advertise salaries for all roles in Tampa, so you know what you're getting into & that's on you\r\n\r\n- If you need someone to hold your hand & tell you what to do every minute of the day, or if you need someone to fix all your problems for you, you will hate working here. You are responsible for your own work, end of, and it's a demanding job, so if you're looking for a place to coast by & grab a paycheck, keep coasting\r\n\r\n- If you have thin skin & can't give or receive feedback, you won't like it here. None of it is malicious, but we're not beating around the bush here either. If you make a mistake, someone will tell you so you don't make it again, & you're expected to do the same if you notice the mistake. Same thing goes for the good stuff too though, because we're all about recognizing accomplishments & giving credit where it's due\r\n\r\n- If you're only interested in the benefits & cool culture, but you don't care about the mission, we won't hire you. We want people who want to help others & change the financial world for the better, forever. If you're not about that, you need not apply\r\n\r\n- While there are some opportunities, the relatively flat corporate structure doesn't allow for a ton of upward mobility, so if you're just looking to climb the ladder, again, probably not a great fit. Much greater potential to move horizontally for new challenges and sometimes better pay\r\n\r\n- Timezones can be challenging, since Tampa has a 2-hour overlap with Estonia & a 5-hour overlap with London. Sometimes you'll have to back yourself & make a decision (at least I do in my role) & some people aren't comfortable with that.

Yet, they only take Estonian salaries as benchmarks.\r\n\r\nWorking purely \"for mission\" can only be used to influence young person's mind, but in fact is just a trick. They build up a good reputation around them, so people can compromise to accept worse offers. Stock options are intangible and other perks are not going to pay off your mortgage and other commitments in the end of the month. Its a shame, as a top company in Estonia they could do a bit more and give back to their community to help their own people to not live in a never-ending poverty, as they have all power and resources to do so.\r\n\r\nAnd last thing, as many ex and current employees hold shares in TW, its also under their interest to retain very good image of the company, which explains such a small portion of really honest reviews published here.

The atmosphere is very entrepreneurial, but very supportive and positive at the same time. The collective is really global/international, so the variety of people who work here is massive.\r\n\r\nBeing surrounded by people who are smarter and better then you definitely helps you refine and develop your A game. Whatever your field, you'll likely be doing things that no one else has ever done before - and that's pretty exciting as well.", "cons": "If you have been working in a place where your boss gives you daily instructions and if you love stable rules and strict settings - then this place is not for you. So far the hiring has been focused on getting people who are responsible adults and people who do not need any babysitting. Coincidentally sometimes these responsible adults are also workaholics. So there is a small chance of TransferWise swallowing up your entire life - unless you have kids or a really exciting personal life. \r\n\r\nObviously the people make the company and if you're looking to join, then remember that you are being measured up to people who have already established a reputation of being industry heavy hitters - be it business, design, customer support, engineering etc. So the barrier to entry can be a little intimidating sometimes."}, {"review_title": "A place to learn, grow, be challenged and earn decent salary for your work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Oct 2016", "job_title": "Product Specialist in Tallinn", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing people that you can access, learn from and work with.

It's not without shortcomings, far from it, but compared to most companies, it is a unique place wherever you're in your career. But make sure you're prepared for a tough but fun ride with a lot of people that you'd like to work together, that is if you're acclimated to the culture. \r\n\r\nThere are so many pros but for a software developer (engineer), let me just tell you some facts and you can be your own judge:\r\n\r\n- It is very product engineering driven; we're talking about many engineers not only knowing their trade well (good programmers) but also caring and having deep knowledge about the products. It is also reflected in the interview process where there is a round of interview with a product manager for all the engineering candidates. \r\n\r\n- The culture feels the same when it is >400 engineers now, as when it was <100 engineers 2 years ago. Some companies would have simply met their final destination before hitting that number, and others would have different cultures that are so far from the original. Not at TransferWise. \r\n\r\n- There are so many friendly and collaborative fellow engineers, who would not hesitate to help if asked. Obviously not everybody is like that but the majority are very much so. The reason? Most of us share the same understanding of why we work at TransferWise and how we can achieve our mission, and being a humble contributor seems to be just the cure. \r\n\r\n- In terms of tech leads, IMHO it is a highly selective group of people and the bar has been held high so far. I'll say a bit more on the cons side below but the pros side is that this makes sure we have the consistency which is key to preserve and evolve the culture. Most if not all the leads are solid developers, and more or less experienced in people management too. \r\n\r\n- Oh, did I mention that Kristo, the CEO, was/is a programmer? That's not just some stories PR would like to tell you - I've reviewed his code and he cares about engineering. Nowadays he doesn't voice his opinions on engineering any more, perhaps conscious of the weight his opinions may carry; but you can rarely find another unicorn CEO having the same profile.\r\n\r\nCompensation-wise, everybody owns part of the company no matter how small (or big for some people) it is.", "cons": "Let me say this first: every company has room to improvement, TransferWise no exception. I've always been keeping a critical eye on things because I care about the company. The scale and field TransferWise is operating on is very different from another company, so the problem we're facing sometimes exposes our shortcomings. \r\n\r\nIn engineering, \r\n\r\n- Tech leads are very overloaded. From the start, the requirement is that they have to be good at both engineering and people management (as we don't have engineering manager setup like some other tech companies), as well as understand how TransferWise works. Any one of those would be a big ask, let alone three. I personally would start introducing engineering manager (people manager) in the structure. Recent career map on new IC levels also paves way for some leads who may not want to pursue a people management career to stay on the technical track. \r\n\r\n- Speaking of career, it's hard to see us offering a lot. When we were small, it's all about having the impact, not your title/level; Now we're relatively big, still with the very flat structure in engineering, there isn't much for a promising engineer to go up to, other than being a tech lead, which as I mentioned above, is pretty overloaded/overworked. Hopefully the new levels would help a bit but we may need to change something more drastically to improve that.\r\n\r\n- Diversity: not that we don't care (at least I care deeply), it's tricky to make start on this when you have an all-male and sometimes all-white interview line-up. There are some good initiatives but we can definitely do more at intern/graduate/experience levels. \r\n\r\n- Communication: it has improved greatly over time but still room for more. It's difficult given our global presence but I'm confident we'll do better.\r\n\r\n- Compensation: no bonus or performance related pay is fine when the company is small, as stock options is doing the job; as we grow, stock options may become less relevant and to attract talents who may have a preference on cash over options, this is something we should consider."}, {"review_title": "It's not just a job.
