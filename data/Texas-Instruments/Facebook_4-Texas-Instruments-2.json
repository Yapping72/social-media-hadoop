Management which is commonly referred to as \"slave drivers?\" \n\nAll this while being paid 40% under market value!? Bay Area compensation is truly awful.

This place will kill your soul and make you woefully unprepared for anywhere you actually have to be creative or think for yourself.

Even after a whole team left over a couple of years and managers kept dropping like flies, nobody asked a single question of why that might be (terrible management).  \n\nI do think the company is aware and the awful management is purposeful to some degree. Cheaper to get employees to quit than lay them off. Better to grind through people or only have the people who don't know work life boundaries stay around. Or so the thinking goes. \n\nTech is awful, large parts of work should be automated and systematized. Management should be happy to hear large parts of the job could be done away with.  Does not work like a tech company under the hood. \n\nI learned the irony of Silicon Valley being named after dinosaurs like this while real tech companies push boundaries with their products, business model, operations, compensation, and culture. \n\nNo CRM. Seriously, everything is tribal knowledge, email chains, and spreadsheets meticulously updated for many hours each week.
