Because you work from home, Apple excepts you to me flexible. They probably see this as luxury or perk. I.e. I worked a 2nd shift schedule and it was completely changed a week prior to the new schedule change date. It was changing due to my team being selected to test out a product. It was completely changing to an much earlier shift. It was an issue as I had other commitments in place and worked a 2nd job. *This happens across the board; happens to several other people I know of. \r\n\r\n- Little work for advice: If working from home, there are limited opportunities to advise. All opportunities will be based working in at home call center environment/role. I.e. AHA Tier 2, Team Manager, Area Manager. If you want more up in other areas, it would require a move to CA or TX. \r\n\r\n- The job role is stressful: Apple has been ranked the best customer service award for 14+. Although they whole culture is much different than most traditional call centers, their matrix system is out of this world. \r\n\r\n- Work days are long: As an AHA you get the opportunity to select from 3 shift types; 4x4, 5x8, 4x10. The 4x4 is where you work 4 hours, take 4 hours off, come back finish 4 hours. You work this shift 5 days straight, with 2 days off. The 5x8 is where you work 8 hours and work 5 days straight, with 2 days off. The 10x4 is where you work 4 days straight for 10 hours with 3 days off. If you work from home, I would highly recommend the 4x4 shift. The calls can be stressful, long, and on top of this you have to meet your matrix. Having the 4 hour break in between the 4x4 really helps. The 5x8 and 10x4 feels like punishment. You pretty much don't have a life working on these type of shifts. \r\n\r\n- Shift bidding: Is based on your matrix performance. Matrix performance is based on the following:\r\n - having great surveys based from the customers (this is mainly if you were able to solve their problem), low call handling time (very impossible based on the type of calls have), low after call work time, calling a supervisor for help (the lower the better), call resolution. If you do have good stats based on these areas, your shift selection will not very limited. \r\n\r\n- You are monitored like a hawk: They monitor every little thing you do while on a call. They can even view what you are doing while on break and in between calls. \r\n\r\n- The Apple perks: I was surprised to learn of the apple discounts offered to their employees. For employees you get 25% off on 1 type of OS X system, 1 type of iOS system, accessories all per year. Employee family and friends receives 15% off 10 type of OS X systems, 10 type of iOS systems, accessories all per year. Also the employee gets a $500 EPP credit towards OS X or some iOS systems, and $250 on lower priced products every 3-4 years. The 25% off plus the $500 or 250 credit is not bad every 3-4 years, but other than that it's still expensive. Especially at an AHA pay rate, when it's your role to know and trouble shoot the product. Look at Google, they actually gifted their employees with their products. Very little discount, nothing to brag about. Apple is very cheap.\r\n\r\n- Working OT - Working OT is a killer. You won't get back for OT too if you don't 'work' your 40 hours per week. I.e. I worked almost 20 hours OT and was only paid OT for 7 hours. This is because my 40 hour work week were on days that the department was closed. Still received pay for the holiday off, but because I didn't 'work' my 40 hours, they took it off my OT. Although I technically worked almost 60 hours that week. \r\n\r\nThey expect you to stay and be a lifer: Because it's 'Apple' they expect their employees to stay and make a life with the company it is build this way at the beginning of training."}, {"review_title": "Product design engineer intern", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jun 2016", "job_title": "Mechanical Engineer in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary, tech shuttles, opportunity to work at a a top company.
