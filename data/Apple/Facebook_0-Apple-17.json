This is the BIGGEST pro of them all.  No hassle with traffic, saves on gas, no parking worries.  Pretty much self explanatory.\r\n\r\nBENEFITS.  Are really good.\r\n\r\nPAY. Apple pretty much pays living wages, which is higher than comparable positions of the same caliber at other companies.  Also overtime is offered during the busy times/product launches, which is great if you need the extra money.\r\n\r\nMISC. Telling people you work for Apple is a great conversation starter..  The SWAG they send, and they send you all the equipment needed to perform your job. Discounts on Apple products are great as well.", "cons": "SHIFTS AND SCHEDULING.  Anybody in the Apple AHA environment knows that one thing that keeps on changing is your schedule. If you value having a set schedule or have a lot of other commitments, then I would advise not to take a job in the AHA-sphere.  Your shift is assigned based on your stats, but sometimes it can really just be random.  And then you are stuck with the schedule, unless you are lucky enough to find someone to trade with.  In addition to the schedule change frequency is the type of schedules that are offered.  I've never seen such an odd array of schedules, with some schedules you do not have time to do anything but work, and very little time for anything else.  Their explanation is the schedules are made to accommodate when the customers contact us (however weekends still seem to have a massive call/chat volume and understaffed.)\r\n\r\nTRANSFERS. For some reason, you can be transferred to a different team or have a different manager transferred to your team out of the blue.  Changing of mangers a lot is a biggie, as each have their own personal way doing things and \"rules\".  So what was okay with one manager, may not be okay with another, and vice versa.  \r\n\r\nWORKING FROM HOME.  Although mentioned as a pro, can be a con as well.  Working from home constantly can soon become mundane and getting a case of cabin fever.  Also you can feel a bit disconnected from your teammates since you are not in the same room/building/office with them talking face to face.\r\n\r\nMISC. A small con in regards to metrics/stats and policies.  You are always coached on providing a customer with more than average interaction, and strive to have complete customer satisfaction.  Of course this is easier said than done, as there are many policies in place that prevent us from giving a customer the resolution they want, and this of course will effect your metrics/stats.  And you have to be at your current position for 12 months before you can be considered for anything else (promotion, transfer, etc.)"}, {"review_title": "Great place,fun and free", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Dec 2015", "job_title": "Retail Specialist in Las Vegas, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The culture is awesome at apple!

Unfortunately, you can't bring +1s, and they're increasingly segmenting this team away from the main events. Last party I attended, Marketing threw a holiday party for their team - and then they threw a second one that App Review was invited to. Reminds me of segregation. Not all Apple employees are created equal.\r\n\r\nHealthcare is good - for now.

The shifts are strict. The management, with the exception of one or two, sucks. No free food. Rare team events that continue to dwindle in number over time. Lots of internal drama and power struggle. The rest of Apple looks down on you as not truly being a part of Apple. There's no visibility with anyone higher than the management level. There's very rare internal promotion. There is no feedback loop. \r\n\r\nLast I checked, employees were asking for a survey to provide management with feedback. The survey was conducted. Employees asked for results. Management kept dodging the question. They know something's wrong, and they don't want to acknowledge it.\r\n\r\nHonestly. Stay away. Stay far, far away.\r\n\r\nI stuck it out due to pressure from family and friends who insisted that having Apple on my resume would be worth the pain. Looking back, I really can't say that it was worth the years of anxiety, depression, unhappiness, that comes from a toxic environment. It got to the point where I didn't even care anymore. I was about to snap-quit any second. And I'll be honest - I was fired. Yeah, no severance pay.\r\n\r\nI walked off campus and I felt liberated - I had absolutely no fear from being fired, which I found incredible and surprising. I took the summer off to travel and regroup. I realized I wasn't innately a depressed or anxious individual - it had developed over time from the sheer stress and unhappiness levels from this work place environment.\r\n\r\nI heard through friends that around 15 people left the team soon after.\r\n\r\nWithin 2 weeks of deciding I was ready to come back to work, I found a new job at an awesome company with amazing culture. I wasn't going to make the same mistake twice - I was willing to take a pay cut to ensure I spent 60 hours a week in good company. (Did I mention  overtime is the norm at Apple?)\r\n\r\nBut the best part is - that wasn't necessary. I essentially doubled my salary. Based on what Glassdoor is currently reporting, I make more money than the management that fired me.\r\n\r\nMy advice: Hold out for something better if you have the opportunity. I understand sometimes options are limited, or sometimes you just really need a paycheck. But don't come to this department to stay long unless they make some big changes."}, {"review_title": "Lovely Place to Work - Not Suitable for All Though", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Dec 2018", "job_title": "Technical Support in Cork", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work from home - can be very comforting to work in your own home office and not have the pressures or dress code.

I love not working on commission, because you can truly sit there and have a deep talk with the customer, and just talk about computers and things that they are going to be using it for, this allows for a much deeper connection, and makes people feel better about what their buying. Thats something thats great about apple, you believe in what you sell for the most part. They are great computers most of the time, and the iphone ipod touch etc are amazing gadgets.  The people that work there are also great, and I have met many friends that I have become close with. Also, the managers are very caring, and for the most part are there to either fix a mistake, or facilitate a smooth interaction between you and a customer. This is a very good quality that every manager should have, and having the power and ability to help someone out by going to the manager is a great satisfying feeling. If i feel someone shouldnt have to pay for something, or they've been treated badly before and it isn't right, then I can talk to the manager and for the most part he/she will agree with me. I love having that power to truly help someone. Along similar lines, is that you aren't trying to sell someone something they don't want, so you can be completely straight forward and honest. Say hey these are the great things about this computer, but if you personally don't feel justified for spending this much money? Then go somewhere else and buy another computer if thats what you prefer, theres no difference for me.

That is a great thing about this place, being able to really help, and be a completely honest unmasked person, not working for money based motives. And if people ask you questions you don't know, you arent forced to lie, or make something up to sound good, you walk over to a computer and google it, or find someone else who knows the answer and get the information.

Applecare is fine, because hey you should buy applecare it is a good idea. On the nanos/touchs its a little iffy, but still a worthy investment. But procare? Very situational service, as is mobileme and 1v1. You pitch all these services and feel like you're pushing them, and sometimes you are harder than you should, because you start thinking man this could help my procare numbers! And everyonce in awhile, someone buys it and they never use it, but you made it sound good. 1v1 is great, if you need lessons. Mobile me is awesome, if you have multiple devices you want to sync, or would use the ilife sweet and storage space online. and procare is cool if you have an extra 100 bucks to plop down to be a VIP. But the fact of the matter is people do come in on budgets, and they shouldnt be treated any less well than others. If someone says hey, i have 1323 dollars, I'm going to buy a macbook, but I'll be back with that money. I know he/she is not getting applecare or any other service, so I don't paticularly want that sale. If they see me and come to me when they come in than thats that, but if they dont, ill be happy about that. That shouldn't be in my motivations. The reason you can buy applecare within a year, is because this is a huge investment and people sometimes don't have the money to throw down an extra 160 and up. Yes its worthy, but if you've been saving to get yourself this computer, and you just made 1300, you're not going to save up another couple weeks and come back to buy applecare and the computer at once, u'll buy it and tack it on later when you have the money. Theres nothing wrong with that, that person gets a great computer that they've been wanting and has the option of spacing out the spending on applecare. The problem, however, is we think shoot no applecare, and that person becomes slightly less important. They shouldn't but they do. If someone buys an ipod Touch from me, and they get applecare, I will go out of my way to put on a screen protector, I have a good chance of offering to do it. But if no applecare, than unless they ask I'm not putting on a screen protector. They didn't help my numbers. It just makes commission stress in a non-commissioned job, and sometimes that can get to be overwhelming. I should be excited for them and say, lets enjoy your new computer Ill show you cool things, have fun with it! And i do, but a little less enthusiastically because in the back of my mind I\"m thinking, where can I put applecare into this sentence so they come back and buy it from me? Yes, some people just blow off applecare, but I'd rather pitch it my best, and then at least know they're very likely to get it in the near future. It is a great service, but some people are skeptical, and if they want to go home ask their friends, research it before they buy it, then they should be able to! I shouldnt be gunning for them to buy now! They'll find out its great, and they'll get it! If there were a way to link a particular computer to that sale, so that when applecare eventually is registered..that would be better, but still, we're being judged on how much money people have, and what they are willing to spend. somedays Ill get 100 percent applecare, somedays people jsut don't want it. I pitch it the same, and I'm good at it, but thats the way it is. I purposely avoid saying you have a year to sign up, because I know once I say that its game over...then they say oh we'll get it later. They should know that, they should have options upfront so they can make the best decision for them. For some people that just want to cruise, this isnt a problem. You won't get fired for your numbers unless they're really bad for a really long time. But for people like me, who hope to one day be a manager, the stress is unbearable. Every sale you want to improve you're numbers, you want to blow every one else out of the water, you want to be that successful stand out that is the only choice for manager. But sometimes its just the people that you get, and not how great, how helpful, and how good you are at pitching the services. I can go on for hours about how cool mobile me is, but if you don't want it/can't afford it, you're going to tune me out. If you don't have multiple devices, then I talk about iLife, if you don't use that, and have no interest, I talk about storage space and backups...if you just don't want it, and have no need for it, than I won't sell it to you or try any harder to sell it. And in the back of my mind I think, damn, there goes a little bit of my numbers.\r\nAnother negative about working there is the occasional rude customer. At least once a week I get a foreign person that comes in, and tries to buy 3 iphones, with no applecare, mobileme etc. (ouch my numbers!) but the annoying part is it is because they are reselling them, and there is no point of having a personal connection with them, in fact they will resist it. All of them will lie straight to your face, and that is demeaning  and depressing. On at least 3 occasions I've had someone tell me they are psyched to get an iphone, they tried their friends and loved it, they are buying one for themselves and one for their family member...I start ringing it up, get an error, call at&t and they say this account has purchased too many iphones. Then i go back out to the floor, and say to the person that literally just told me this is my first iphone, im excited!, that they have already had too many, and cannot buy another one. Once the guy continued with the act, said really on my account? that cant be, maybe my brother bought one....and I say, you need 10 to be limited, and he says no way....then says, i'll figure it out with at&t and come back. Clearly does not come back. That is a negative to working here, but its an acceptable annoyance for mostly genuinely good customers."}, {"review_title": "The best retail store on the planet.

Just about everyone you work with is extremely friendly.  There is an energy in the store unlike anything I have ever seen, like everyone is just so happy to be there, employees and customers alike.  There are always customers bustling in and out of the stores, sometimes to many to handle, but you never feel intimidated.  You actually feel like you can help everyone in the store with what they need.  There is no commission, which is a good thing for three reasons.  First, so there is no competition between you and other employees, everyone works together to answer the customer's questions and get them what they need.  Second, you don't have to be pushy when trying to sell a customer something, which allows you to almost build a relationship with the customer.  There are various customers who will come in now and say, \"Hey, how are you doing?  How's your family?  I'm doing great, my Mac runs wonderful.\"  Third, there are no goals to meet every week or month.

When you argue with the higher management, they will deny it even happening, even if you show them your pay rate against another person's pay rate.  Also, you would think that because one works for Apple, one would know when new products are going to come out before the public.  Sadly, no.

WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT\"\r\nYou really have to plan around Apple when you take vacation.  Forget about taking anything longer than 2.5 weeks straight.  They simply can't have you outside of Apple for that long even if you do have the time off.  Every year, Apple has this plan where you can cash in 1 day of vacation if you take one day of vacation.  ie: -2 days of vacations, you get paid for one day on your paycheck.  A lot of people end up taking a day off (although still working on that day) only because they would otherwise have too many hours (it's just that hard to get vacation there).  If the product is about to launch in a couple of months, don't even bother taking time off."}, {"review_title": "This is a job that does not annoy me.

The best thing about working at Apple is your coworkers. They do an excellent job of hiring incredibly intelligent, talented people. It's quite humbling to work alongside such accomplished people. You'll always feel like the dumbest person in the room, which is great because everyone has so much to teach you. Most of them are ego-free (about 70% of them) and will help you whenever possible. There are so many personality types, though nearly all of them are perfectionist Type A people. If that is your kind of crew, you'll do well.\r\n\r\nThe work usually comes in waves. When you're on, you're all the way on. For weeks at a time you can expect late nights and no weekends. On the flip side, when it's slow, it's very slow. You can often work from home or take comp days. During downtimes it is not uncommon to go in for five hours including a long lunch and then go home.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the compensation is good. The stock program is okay. But the pay is more than fair and their annual reviews pretty much guarantee a raise, bonus, and/or more stock.\r\n\r\nFinally, Tim Cook seems like a genuinely good person.

Great creative happens when you're exposed to a lot of different projects and people, not in a vacuum. Apple will make you sit in your sandbox and churn out a huge amount of work for a single thing. And don't you dare look at someone else's sandbox. They live by the phrase \"individual contributor\". It's not collaborative in the least. This creates a giant divide between creative teams and roles, a divide that can be frustrating, isolating, and overwhelming.\r\n\r\nOn top of that the management style and structure is a disaster. Prepare for massive insecurity, nitpicking, micromanagement, unrealistic expectations, information silos, finger-pointing, miscommunication between management titles, and all the unfortunately awful qualities so often associated with the dreaded \"middle management\". Meanwhile the people at the top, who could actually effect change, have earned the right to be blissfully unaware.

I've had a few procedures done and did not have to pay anything out of pocket. By far the absolute best, most affordable benefits I've ever had.\r\n\r\nDISCOUNTS\r\nWithout getting into too many details, I will say that the discounts offered to the employees are reasonable. I have definitely used mine and I'm grateful for them. I've always loved Apple products so this was just icing on the cake.\r\n\r\nWORK FROM HOME\r\nThere are a lot of scams out there concerning working from home. This is one of the few opportunities that truly offer a job that you can do from the comfort of your home and actually make money. Its not invasive and they really allow you to be independent. You're not really micromanaged per-say.. but just know you will not be able to \"pretend\" you're working.\r\n\r\nSALARY\r\nI would say that what I got hired for is well worth what I'm paid. I no longer feel that way because I've been cross-trained on so many things and have not received a raise. I am way more valuable to the company then when I first started.. therefore, I feel I should be compensated for that value. I believe that it would be fair to increase the pay, per skill. But overall, the starting pay is well above the minimum wage. I'm able to live comfortably and I'm able to do things that I enjoy that I wasn't able to do with the previous pay with other jobs. \r\n\r\nPERKS\r\nYou get a lot of perks here at Apple. I'm unable to go into details, but the company does really take care of their employees from a \"material\" and \"health\" standpoint.", "cons": "CHANGES, CHANGES AND MORE CHANGES\r\nThings change all the time as with any business, however, with Apple, some of their changes can affect your overall position and pay. For example, you can be hired as a Chat Advisor, but if the need permits, you'll end up on the phones. Another example is, you can be working on night shift, but then end up on day shift if the need permits. Nothing is set in stone. You can be moved around or changed to go somewhere else at any moment. Apple does not care how it affects you. \r\n\r\nONGOING TRAINING WITH NO PAY INCREASES\r\nYou will get hired for one thing.. but you will be crossed trained for everything else. They're goal is to have all Advisors knowledgeable about all products. They want everyone to be able to float around and provide support anywhere needed. I had been working two months on my own and my stats were horrible. I was still trying to get familiar with what I was trained to do. However, despite my lack of knowledge and ongoing horrible stats which clearly showed I was not ready to take on new products, they trained me on two other products within a month of each other. I did not receive a pay increase. I was totally stressed out and was about to quit several times. I expressed my anxiety to my manager but they were not able to assist me.\r\n\r\nMANAGERS ARE PUPPETS\r\nI have nothing bad to say about managers other than I feel so sorry for them. You can tell they really want to do something different other than what their superiors are advising them to do. There is ALOT of pressure on them. Their managers are pressing them to get this done by this date with each member on their team. Most of the time when you take a problem to them, they will not hear you out. They will only make excuses as to why something is the way it is. I really do believe that is how they're trained. So I don't blame them. Don't expect your manager to be able to assist you with much. They are not trained to do that. They are trained to protect the brand - which ultimately means, if its not affecting the customer, they really do not care. The only thing they are concerned about is your stats. Anything outside of that they really don't care about. \r\n\r\nYOU WILL DREAD LAUNCHES\r\nLaunches are suppose to be a exciting time, but if the customers you support are directly affected by the launches, you will eventually hate them. I hate whenever Apple launches anything new. Although they test and test and test the product/software, it never works straight out of the box. Apple is a industry giant, but when it comes to product releases, I have yet to experience one that went smooth. Customers go absolutely nuts. Business owners scream at you, curse you and all kinds of things. Its terrible! iTunes and other non-technical departments do not have to deal with launches. \r\n\r\nSTATS WILL KILL YOU\r\nI really don't want to get much into this, but I will say this: It is very hard to have good stats. A customer can chat in, you help them, chat back in and the next person don't help them - the customer gets YOUR survey and mark it negatively based on what the other Advisor did. The customer can chat with you, you send them to the Apple Store, they have a bad experience at the store.. but then use the survey from their interaction with YOU and complain about their store experience. Yes, you can get penalized for what someone else did. I understand how this could happen, but there should be a way for the managers to correct this. The reason this is so important is because this affects promotions, salaries, EVERYTHING!! Currently there is no way to move a survey to the correct person that the customer is complaining about. If its your survey then its your negative mark even if the customer was not complaining about you.\r\n\r\nTHE STUCK SYNDROME\r\nBecause Apple offers such a good pay and good benefits/perks, if you decide that you hate working for Apple, but you don't have a degree or experience to be able to leave the company and find a job that will pay you the same, you'll be stuck. This is exactly what has happened to me. Since working for Apple, I have moved and purchased a car. I thought this was my dream job and that I would retire from here one day. Now I wish I had not purchased anything or moved. That way, I could have at least found another job - still moved and purchased a car based on that income. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Apple, please give yourself at least 6 months to a year before making any major life-changing decisions. This will give you enough time to decide if this is a place you can tolerate or even thrive in. For me, it isn't. I'm job hunting as I work."}], [{"review_title": "Throws away experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Dec 2018", "job_title": "Senior Engineering Manager in Sunnyvale, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lively, good energy, smart people", "cons": "Opinion based decisions.

Managers constantly change so you never create a rapport before getting a new one that treats you as another number. There is no mobility between departments outside of AppleCare; I am a finance major and was hoping this would be a way to get my foot in the door of the finance department, however, there is only mobility in AppleCare.

The employees and management are very upbeat and genuinely happy to be there and ask questions. It's always stressed that as a Specialist, you are NOT a salesperson, but rather a source of information - you are there to inform customers about the products so that they can make the best decision possible rather than pushing them to buy this or that, and as much as that sounds like some kind of corporate line, I always found it to be true in practice. I was never really pushed to sell more or less of any specific product. There are daily/monthly/yearly metrics, yes, but as retail employees don't work on commission, they're more used to track your own sales and progress - there's also some friendly competition between sales staff as well. Management is usually very helpful and accommodating - they can sometimes be inundated with any number of things, but usually if you simply remind them a couple times that you need to sit down for something, etc., they always do their best to find time to resolve your issues.", "cons": "This may have changed since I worked at Apple retail, but my training concentrated a lot on customer service and sales, which is great. It did not concentrate too much on store procedures and policy, which isn't too great. I found, at least when I was working there, that there's a lot of \"learn as you go\" in terms of customer returns, which forms to fill out, who to direct questions to, where items are located in back-of-house (such as service items), etc. While it's not terribly difficult to figure these things out on your own, it would help tremendously if more time was spent on giving this basic information during training so when you encounter those types of situations, you're not left scratching your head or scrambling around to find someone who knows how to do what you need to be doing - it looks unprofessional to the customer. \r\n\r\nApple corporate also keeps employees in the dark just as much as the general public - when the iPhone was announced in January of 2007, the employees only knew as much as the general public did, and had to resort to looking at the website in order to figure out features, pricing, etc. in order to answer questions. I imagine it was the same a year and a half later for the iPhone 3G. While I can understand an amount of secrecy in order to create the necessary \"wow\" effect for when a product launches, there has to be some way to brief the employees in the retail channel that are going to be actually SELLING the thing so that they're not caught too off-guard - even just a \"be prepared tomorrow, something's coming\" would suffice so that people would be mentally prepared.\r\n\r\nAnd when I mentioned earlier that retail employees aren't required to sell certain products, that's really a grey area, and the one place where I was able to keep myself grounded and remember that while Apple is a great place to work, you're still ultimately just selling computers. There are several add-ons or \"attachments\" that you're expected to at least TRY to sell (mobileme [formerly .mac, which is what I sold at the time], ProCare/One-on-One, and AppleCare). These attachments are included in the daily metrics alongside each system you sold, so you can see what you sell better and what you might need to work on. Management will sometimes just have a quick word with you about your attachment rate if it isn't too hot in some areas and ask if you need help in how to sell these products. That's the only real things that I every felt pressured to try to sell, because while it doesn't affect your employment or pay rate, you nonetheless feel that there is pressure to sell these products with the system, even if you think some of them are worthless add-ons (which I personally felt everything except AppleCare were)."}, {"review_title": "Cool yet ruthless", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Apr 2009", "job_title": "Director in Cupertino, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you're looking for the cool factor, Apple is a great place to be.

You'll be able to tell everyone you know that you work for Apple, which carries a certain respect with it.  Your healthcare benefits package will be excellent.  You'll never have to use a PC at work.", "cons": "First of all, despite what you're told at hiring events and new employee training, you don't really work for Apple, Inc.  Instead, you work for Apple Retail, which is for all intents and purposes an entirely different company.  There is little to no career connection between the two, and retail employees are looked upon as second class citizens by corporate employees.  Your chances of getting promoted from Apple Retail to Apple Corporate are no better than they would be if you worked for anywhere else.  In fact, they might be worse.\r\n\r\nThe day to day routine of working for Apple Retail has some significant problems.  You can expect that your needs will always come second to \"the needs of the business.\"  In fact, anytime you hear that phrase, be prepared for the next sentence to describe how you're going to be screwed.  For example, \"I'm sorry, Joe, but the needs of the business dictate that you can't take a vacation between October and February, or June through September\" or \"Well, the needs of the business mean we can't give you a fixed schedule.\"  Your schedule will be erratic.  You may work from 2 PM to 12 AM on Tuesday and be expected to come in at 8 AM the following day.  If there's a product being launched (iPhone, iPad, etc), you may be asked to work overnight to set up the store, then come back in the next day and work another shift.  Sometimes you're asked to work straight through.  During normal weeks your shifts will often be right in the middle of the day, leaving you little time to accomplish anything before or after.  No scheduling preference is given based on seniority, family considerations, or any other factor.  Any and all time off must be requested in writing, often several months in advance, but your schedule won't arrive until a few days before it goes into effect.  Long stretches of the year are blacked out for vacation time, due to the needs of the business.  Favored employees will often be given a pass to take vacations during this time, especially senior managers.\r\n\r\nYour coworkers will be neatly divided into two groups: those who are able to rationalize any decision made by Apple Inc, and those who understand the company for what it really is.  There will be many more of the former than the latter.  If you're a member of the relentlessly optimistic tribe, you can probably do very well in Apple Retail.  If you're not, be prepared to hear impromptu speeches about how Apple products \"change\" and \"enrich\" people's lives, and how amazing it is to work at Apple.  Many of these people will be older, and some will have either failed at or quit other careers to sell computers for a few dollars above minimum wage, which adds an undertone of desperation to their happy message.  If you find yourself in the less optimistic camp, be prepared to be part of a very small minority, and get ready to hear about it when you decide to speak your mind.  In fact, don't speak your mind.\r\n\r\nOverall, Apple Retail is a place that spends a lot of time and money to promote the idea that they Really Care about their employees.  One of the first things you're given when you're hired is the Credo Card, which lays out all that Apple Retail stands for and believes in.  The very first line of the card is, \"At Apple our heart and soul is our people.\"  But what you'll come to realize over time is that Apple Retail doesn't care about you at all.  They care about making money, and above all pleasing the customers.  And that's it.\r\n\r\nIf you hope to have a long, successful and rewarding career at Apple Retail, you'd better really love retail for it's own sake.  Loving the products isn't enough, in time you'll grow to resent them.  You need to love all the complicated, illogical, arcane intricacies that make up the American retail model.  If you do, you'll probably do very well at Apple.  If not, it won't be long before you'll be looking for a way out."}, {"review_title": "This was a summer internship with the iPod New Tech group at Apple that evaluates vendor technologies for iPods", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 Apr 2010", "job_title": "Engineering Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to work with ridiculously intelligent people who are also very creative.

The company rolled out software that slowed down peoples phone once they're battery degraded passed a certain use and told no one, not even the employees. so for so long we would say \" oh it must be the software, let's restore your phone.\" and this entire time we were giving them wrong information and we did even know it.

Everyone was there to help each other no matter what their role in the department was. This is one of the most diverse departments in all of Apple and that used to be celebrated. People were happy and proud to work on that team and for each other. The older positive reviews are for the golden age of App Review. Unfortunately, those days are long long gone. \r\nSo what happened? Management changes. And it\u2019s been a free fall ever since. The new director put in is never there and just doesn\u2019t care about his employees. His only concern since being put in this role has been the implementation of new tools that he created without ever having any kind of understanding or insight on how the reviewers do their jobs.\r\nThey started hiring people from AppleCare - arguably the worst department of Apple corporate. First it was the current operations manager who just has been hiring his cronies ever since. Instead of hiring from within with more than qualified candidates who also have a deep understanding and knowledge of the job function and where to improve he brings up his friends from AppleCare of his golf buddy. The managers that were with the department before have become spineless as their complaints fall on deaf ears too. Most just come in to work everyday to collect their paychecks and wait for their stocks to vest. The others have become so stressed out and take it out on reviewers by micromanaging every aspect of their time at work from what time you punch in to how long you take in the bathroom to checking your screens to see what you\u2019re doing. Their unhappiness and helplessness trickles down to the already unhappy reviewers. \r\nInstead of being a united team this department is now filled with interoffice politics and drama. We no longer have fun events. we no longer have lunch provided. We work longer hours and significantly less flexible shifts. Reviewers are in fear of talking to each other and everyone is on edge. Other departments at Apple have figured this out and will not hire you from App Review. They dont want to touch us with a 10 foot pole. And so unless you decide to start sucking up with the head of operations you have no future in Apple in this department or otherwise. And trust me you do not want to be at a dead end job with this high of a work toxicity level. And if you still decide to take this job you cant say you weren\u2019t warned."}, {"review_title": "Great company that requires management cleanup.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "25 Jul 2018", "job_title": "IT Analyst in Cupertino, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Discounts and healthcare and a very tech savvy environment.

Management plays games with you and tells you you will have all these career opportunities and that you can get promoted. It is a lie, its all about putting your time in.\r\n\r\nI was a top performer and so were many others that I know that have since left. If you have talent this place is frustrating. They don't care about performance they care about who they like and who has been there the longest. \r\n\r\nIf you want to be in management you must be brought in as a manager. It will take you YEARS to become a manager starting as a specialist no matter how good you are. All my managers came from Gap or Starbucks with zero product knowledge. Many with very little management experience even. I have a college degree in Business Management and they brought in a manager with no education from Starbucks and put them over me. This person had managed at Starbucks for a year. \r\n\r\nManagers are not really managers. They are schedule makers and schedule keepers. They simply make the schedules and send people on break and lunch. They do not chart profitability, inventory or any thing that requires skill.\r\n\r\nThe hours are terrible. You have to keep an open schedule if you want to work there full time. That means you can be scheduled from as early as 5am during holiday, to 3am to do overnight. Or in NY they have a 24 hour store I just feel sorry for them. \r\n\r\nThe pay is embarrassing. I personally sold over 1 million dollars worth of product last year. I did not get a raise. I did not get a bonus. I got a small roll up blanket at Christmas that fell apart the first time I washed it. Oh ya and my pay was $23,000 while living in Northern California where rent is about 1200 for a 2 bedroom. You do the math. All of this while Apple just became the most valuable company in the world. \r\n\r\nI am not writing this because I am bitter. I am actually quite happy. I have since left Apple and I am making great money doing something I love. I simply wrote this to hopefully give people an accurate detailed description of what it is really like to work for Apple. Also I hope the people in Cupertino that are in charge of Retail development read this as well because I know from working with them that they are clueless to what really goes on in the store. Your customer service rating will go down and you will lose business because people who are talented will not stay in an environment with no opportunity.  \r\n\r\nI see so many people who fall into the propaganda and think they will some day work for corporate or get into management.

They appreciate it, like pat on the back 'great job' appreciate. But do not value it. There is no significant compensation other than additional vacation time for high levels of experience. That being the case it is good to get out sooner rather than later. They do not cultivate and give incentives for people to stay. The longer you stay, with no upward movement, the more demoralized you will get.  \r\n\r\nTenure and Experience and Hard work DO NOT equal promotion. Apple managers have a secret recipe on who they favor or do not. If you do not fit into a management team's vision, YOU WILL NOT PROGRESS. PERIOD. It is possible to move up and sometimes dramatically if you do fit what they want. I have seen both very worthy and very unworthy (based on their effectiveness after promotion) people promoted. \r\n\r\nManagement is often hired from outside the company which causes a severe cultural mismatch and tremendous frustration. Potential leaders are not developed and people from outside with managers titles who might not click with Apple values are brought in on a regular basis. \r\n\r\nApple essentially asks you to develop yourself. That goes for managers on down. That is an upside for people who use the Apple language and style and live it, sometimes like an automaton. However if you do not speak their development language and feed it back to them, even if you have vast leadership potential they have no way to cultivate you. I've seen people with incredible potential bypassed, grow demoralized and leave because the company cannot find ways to develop people internally, They generally overburden managers and employees so any possible time you have for development is taken away or you have to essentially not do your job and overburden others to make time to do the development things they ask. \r\n\r\nThe company improves their systems which is helpful but essentially is only trying to make everyone (on the technical support side) take more and more people. Work in the technical support side is a thankless job often and more than it was. You are asked to help more and more people while somehow connecting personally and not making it \"transactional\". And often the customers are great but they can also be awful. Not know which you'll get EVERY 10-15 minutes!! Is emotionally draining day after day. And with managers who've never done the job they don't understand the emotional toll the job takes. \r\n\r\nI appreciated my time at Apple but hit a number of walls of demoralization. As did most of the amazing people around me, managers included.

I tried to document my experience as well as possible, and honestly ended up writing much more than I had originally intended. I do want to add the disclaimer that although there is a big block of text in the \"CONS\" section, I did enjoy working at Apple. I liked my job there, paid me well and I got valuable experience. Was it something I'd do as a career? No. Was it a good stepping stone in my professional development? Absolutely. I write this feedback not to slander Apple but to give a genuine account of my experience, prepare others who are considering joining Apple, and hopefully help Apple Retail improve for the sake of all Apple employees. \r\n\r\nAt Apple, I had the privilege of meeting people with all kinds of different backgrounds, education levels, and experiences. Even now that I have moved on, several of my mentors at Apple continue to push me to improve. I can genuinely say that Apple was the most diverse company I have ever worked for, and yet it wasn\u2019t a gimmick or to fill a quota. It felt like you could be your genuine self and I would say that I felt very welcome there. \r\n\r\nI experienced a tremendous amount of personal and professional growth during my time there. If you had asked me before I started, I would never have described myself as a leader and yet by the end of my time at Apple, I had led initiatives, coached/mentored my peers, and established myself as a leader, resource, and mentor. I learned how to talk about myself and the work I\u2019m doing in a concise way (STAR / SBO). I learned how to collaborate with people with different work styles from my own, how to provide feedback in different ways based on how the person best receives it, and I learned how to challenge and be challenged without damaging my relationship with my colleagues. I learned a lot about my own worth as an employee and how to advocate for myself. I learned to seek to understand, to approach mistakes as opportunity for shared growth rather than an opportunity to place blame, and how to be empathetic even when it is easy not to be. \r\n\r\nSome of the best managers I\u2019ve ever had were from Apple. These managers were not afraid to jump into the fray when we were at our busiest. They empowered my colleagues and I to make the call in a tough situation and backed us up on whatever we felt was best. They trusted us to do our jobs well and always sought to understand before giving feedback or calling out problems if they arose. They went to bat for us against managers who were quick to dismiss our talents.", "cons": "For context, I was one of the top repair technicians and consistently rated within the top 3 in the store for repair quality and timeliness from the time I received my ACiT (Apple Certified iPhone Technician) certification. I passed my ACMT (Apple Certified Mac Technician) certification with a 97% (68 questions correct out of 70). In addition, I have prior experience building computers and have a solid grasp on how computers work / what hardware components do. \r\n\r\nNo repercussions for calling off so it wasn\u2019t uncommon for 5-6 people to call off a day.\r\n\r\nAt the Genius Bar, they consistently prioritized personality types over technical skill when considering candidates. Storewide, great candidates were consistently passed over in favor of more vocal candidates. It was also not uncommon for managers to play favorites, and some managers would actually do their best to undermine your development if they didn\u2019t like you.\r\n\r\nI believe that while skills can be taught, attitude is a key point of your personality and is not so easily changed. However, for this model of hiring the person, not the skill, there needs to be sufficient training to get the person up to a functional standpoint. I would say Apple has done a lackluster job when it comes to technician training the past few years. Genius (Mac technician) training consists of two weeks off the sales floor doing self-guided online trainings (few of which that actually apply to the service being provided), a certification assessment, and a week of repair shadowing. After that point, the new Genius can do their first repair ON A CUSTOMER'S MACHINE. Customers pay a lot of money for the products and a lot of money for repairs. It is absolutely unacceptable that the first computer a technician takes apart is a paying customer's machine. In addition, nearly all of the other Geniuses had no computer experience outside the Genius Bar. The troubleshooting process for most of my former peers is just pattern matching reported symptoms with support guides and regurgitating solutions. \r\n\r\nDespite being the youngest Genius on my team and the least tenured in the role, I regularly had to fix the mistakes of my peers. Some examples of repair mistakes include putting screws in the wrong location, not plugging in antenna / mic / camera / battery connectors before marking a repair as ready for customer pickup, not taking security precautions when dealing with batteries, leaving ESD sensitive components sitting out uncovered for hours at a time, bending a pin on a logic board, and more. I also had to reset customer expectations after one of my peers advised a customer that her new iMac wouldn\u2019t run any faster than her 2013 iMac because they both had HDDs. The issue the customer was experiencing was no more related to the HDD than Java is related to Javascript (read: not related at all). In the end, I was able to fix the issue but the customer had clearly lost faith in the Genius Bar and honestly, I can\u2019t blame her for that. \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue though, in my opinion, was the inconsistency in management. The managers were either amazing or the worst, no in between. See my experience with the good ones in the \u201cPros\u201d section. The bad managers, though, were awful. Micromanagement, lack of trust, and blatant favoritism were common. These managers clearly prioritized the customer in the store rather than the customer with a device awaiting repair. Mac repair consisted of 1-3 technicians (normally 1 on weekdays, 2 on fri/sat, 3 for special occasions), occurred only once per day for 2-3 hours maximum (normally 2), and yet at least one Mac technician was pulled to the floor early on a nearly daily basis causing a never-ending cycle of late repairs and angry customers. \r\n\r\nThe store leader was the worst, in my opinion. They had no knowledge of Genius Bar processes yet frequently made (impossible) requests of the technicians. Example: a customer came in with a device with no accessible device identifier (missing SIM tray = no IMEI, would not turn on so no S/N, and the serial reader tool didn\u2019t retrieve anything from the phone). The customer was advised that ideally the SIM tray would be needed or at minimum a proof of purchase to service the device as the internal ticketing system was tied to the device identifier (SN) and there was no way to create a repair / replacement for the device without it, even as a customer service exception. The customer started to escalate and get visibly upset, so the store leader got involved and after being informed of the situation, advised the technician to just replace the phone (a common exception when a customer is escalated).

Management has no problem assigning more responsibility but never compensates for it either in the way of a raise or in the form of preference for day off or scheduling requests. Lastly, there is no commission structure in place. Given the huge disparity in work ethic (which translates to sales), some kind of commission structure would make the mayhem worth it, but there isn't. There is nothing to reward me for working at a grueling pace all day to try and keep customers happy\u2014I make the same as a peer who has figured out just how much work they need to get done to look busy and fly under the radar.

For example, a customer called me the N-word, and when I told my store leader about my experience, he responded with with another derogatory term in an attempt to 'connect' and told me that \"the company does not protect [my] comfort.\" Coworkers and managers alike have made inappropriate racist, homophobic, and sexist remarks. Whenever a person of color tries to confront the issue of racism, we are met with hostility, gaslighting, and condescension. The turnover rate for Black employees is disturbingly high, but little attention has been paid to this. These are, however, the most blatant examples. Most of the time, the offenses are subtle: offhanded comments, being called out more for negligible, nitpicky things and ignored for everything else, half-hidden little happenings that make you think you're losing your mind. Promotions favor young, White men; they are hired full-time into the company, while my female, part-time coworkers, regardless of race, have had to work twice as hard and for twice as long to receive the promotions doled out to their male counterparts.

It's not at all infrequent for people in leadership positions at other companies to be promised a fast-track into Apple Retail's leadership ranks but, too often, once you've taken the bait there isn't much you can do to move upward.\r\n\r\nInternal promotions are exceedingly rare so don't be surprised when you find yourself working for a manager hired externally from another retailer or even a fast food restaurant.  Apple has quietly de-emphasized growth training and is now focussed on throughput at the expense of all else, including employee and customer satisfaction.  \r\n\r\nFrom a products and services standpoint Apple has done very little of late to cause excitement.  If you're on the support side of things expect frequent laments from customers about the degradation of Apple's products.  Frequent recalls, abrupt cancellations of favorite services, and a general feeling that we've been here before.  Apple has trod on its reputation for so long now that it almost seems quaint to recall the days when hundreds of people would line up for days in anticipation of a new product launch."}, {"review_title": "Apple", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Feb 2017", "job_title": "Family Room Specialist in Santa Rosa, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good starting salary.

Speaking from a retail perspective, many employees in the past were experienced working professionals who had deep knowledge in their respective fields be it photography, audio engineering, or filmmaking. What an employee lacked in knowledge or for upcoming software changes, Apple management and department leads made sure you were given ample development time to grow and learn. The structure then was unofficially to inspire your customers, and the sales will follow.\r\n\r\nAs time progressed, Apple leadership put more emphasis on \"people leaders\" who had poor knowledge of the product. As such, many of these new \"people leaders\" brought in from companies like Starbucks, Best Buy, Target, etc. didn't and still don\u2019t share those same values as their passionate employees. Over time, the professionals working for the company became burned out and moved on, either by their own accord or a manager's. To fill the places of these working professionals were employees with no professional background, given little practical training on the software they were to learn resulting in having employees with poor knowledge on the product or subject if questions arose. The Apple professionals remaining in the company became complacent and/or bitter that they were being paid similar amounts as those newer employees with lesser experience, yet they were expected to assist with their deeper knowledge when a customer required it. This effect cause these professionals to exploit Apple's attendance policies resulting in less staff during a planned out day. A great example is seeing the Genius Bar become so famously behind. A lot of that is due to staff calling out for their shifts leaving their peers and lower ranking employees to pick up the pieces and learn-on-the-fly. When these problematic staff members were set to be confronted, they'd go out on leave-of-absence through stress or some sort of injury and return once the dust settles on their attendance record. This is a very deep problem Apple has yet to permanently resolve today.\u2028\u2028\r\n\r\nWhat has since become noticed and evident is how most of Apple\u2019s newest leaders are not inspirational tech professionals. They don\u2019t develop you to want to use the platform or software. They weren\u2019t promoted through the ranks, but were rather hired outside the company and brought in. They\u2019re most interested in taking you through leadership development for a few months at your same rate then throwing you back into your old responsibilities with little to show for what you\u2019d learned. The bulk of their leaders don\u2019t even know how to use a word processor, build a spreadsheet, or even edit a photo. They\u2019re there to coach on sales, inspire performance, and defuse customer escalations (overriding whatever fair resolution you had positioned to your customer). It\u2019s not the Apple environment it once was, and has slowly gravitated into a sales organization first.

When I first started working at Apple, Inc. the group I was in was highly collaborative with many growth opportunities.  The group I was with was a complete nightmare.  These are the top issues.\r\n\r\n1.  Severe harassment of employees that was encouraged by upper management.  Apple is not a diverse and inclusive place.  My manager, who was a female, believed that women who had children should not be allowed to work at Apple.  She complained to women in my group and to management that \"breeders\" destroyed the culture at Apple.  She told me that she will only hire young men and she has held to that promise, she hired three young men.  She said she would never hire another breeding female.  Her behavior is known by HR and management and encouraged.  When my coworker had to drive her sick kid to the doctor she was furious, she said when she was a kid she rode her bike to the doctor and she didn't understand why we had to drive our kids to the doctor.  When I was out for two days with the influenza A virus (only two days were missed) she required that I send a positive test result (which I did because I didn't realize it was illegal) to get the two days of sick time approved.  My manager also spoke out against larger size people in public spaces.  Calling people, including me fat and saying fat people are lazy and shouldn't work at Apple.   After working almost 10 consecutive weeks without a break I ended up in the ER with a heart arrhythmia.  I was told by my manager that people with my heart condition should not be allowed to work at Apple and that I should leave.  I only missed one WEEKEND of work because I was in the ER.  My manager also had a policy that if we were sick we had to publicly email everyone about our sick leave and the nature of the illness.  Talk about embarrassing.  Thankfully HR did stop her from doing this.  Also my manager and Apple in general is strongly agist.  I've been a part of interviews where hiring managers would pass by older (in 40s) candidates based solely on age.  There were also snide comments and decisions made about clothing choices (too nicely dressed) of people interviewing.  Myself and many others were repeatedly called stupid, it was humiliating.  I have 13 years of engineering with graduate degree.  If she found your work to not be of value, you were called stupid and publicly and privately humiliated.  One of my coworkers use to go to her car at lunch every day and cry.  They eventually drove her out and forced her to retire.\r\n\r\n2.  Speaking out is strongly discouraged and if you're brave enough to speak up about the toxic culture your career at Apple will be destroyed, even if you have HR involvement.  HR promised me there would be no retribution for speaking up, they lied.   My breaking point is when my manager threatened to fire me because I wouldn't give up the name of the person who heard her talking about me and others as being fat.  After years of harassment I went to HR for help.  After an extensive HR investigation nothing was done, at least nothing I could see from my end.  Her treatment of me and my team members got worse.  Her reputation of being a lethal bully transcended our group and organization.  Her own husband admitted to my friend she would be a nightmare to work for.  The end result of the HR investigation was my career at Apple, with the help of HR, being destroyed.  Speaking up has destroyed many people within the organization.\r\n\r\n3.  Promoting people to management position that have no idea how to manage or even interact with other humans.  Just because someone is a good engineer doesn't mean they can be a good leader. \r\n\r\n4.  No opportunity for growth or even transfer within in Apple.  There are some organizations, mine was like this, they took complete offense if you asked to transfer.  I wanted to learn how to automate, learn new skills and take on more responsibility.  I was told that  I was to stick to what I was doing and I would be nothing more than that.  When I first asked for support to transfer I was told I was not allowed to transfer.  When I interviewed with other groups, who were very excited to have me working with them, I was blocked by my manager.  If you want to grow or transfer, it will not happen.\r\n\r\n5. Women are payed significantly less than the male coworker doing the same work.  For example I had almost 14 years of experience at Apple, had managed and had multiple degrees.  A male new hire who was new to this kind of engineering work (recent grad) was paid $25k more than I was making.  My other male coworkers (who had much less experience) made significantly more than I and the other women did.\r\n\r\n6.  Apple will work you to death, literally, with no remorse.   People are fodder for the engine that makes Apple billions.  The working hours are brutal.  Families are destroyed.  Employees burn out, have breakdowns, health issues, some have even committed suicide (shot himself in the head in a meeting room).   This is true for every group I've worked at Apple.  There were many nights of sleeping under the desk, when you get a chance.  I once had 10 weeks in a row with no weekend break.  There was one week that I never got to see my kids at all.  When the weather became horrible in California I was trapped by roads that had washed out.  I was told to leave my children at home (alone) and get a hotel (which cost more per day than I made) next to work.  Because I refused to leave my kids at home for the 2 days I missed, I was called out in my review for not getting a hotel.  Can you imagine?  The stuff that happened in China and Apple was not surprising given how they treat their US employees."}, {"review_title": "(Product Zone Specialist) Great team and benefits, but can get Veeerrryyyy boring", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Apr 2018", "job_title": "Product Zone Specialist in Newcastle upon Tyne, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- A great team seems to be almost a universal thing!

I think it\u2019s particularly bad if you\u2019re stuck in a mall rather than a stand alone store - but we had some Weird As Heck regulars to deal with, particularly notable at our store: a young autistic man with a penchant for harrassing young female memebers of staff.\r\n\r\n- if you get sucked into Visual Merchandising (like I did) prepare to be very frustrated! It\u2019ll keep you busy, but honestly VM can attract some very bossy, nuerotic people. \r\nThe vibe from management is very if something is broken \u201cwhy is this broken, why aren\u2019t you fixing it\u201d then, if you are fixing it \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you on the shop floor\u201d\r\nWould I say avoid VM at all costs? No! Fab oppourtunities with new store openings and becoming a global mentor, but it might be more of a pain than it\u2019s worth.\r\n\r\n- it\u2019s hard to stand out in such a big company, and hard to develop your Stock Competancies beyond \u201cI can give extremely good customer Service.\u201d There are very few oppourtunities for you to pick up niche little responsabilities (ie: at a previous retail job where the team was tiny, I wrote all the copy emails for our store) to keep you busy or pad out your experience beyond standard customer service.\r\nI\u2019ve gotten a new job in marketing, and all of my examples at interview I had to pull from working in smaller business, or side projects (and if you want to get out of retail while working at apple I\u2019m afraid you will need side projects) \r\n\r\n- I really struggled with boredom on PZ during off seasons (ie: January - July), honestly I basically ended up taking over Visual Merchandising, not because I Love Fixing Display Cables but because I was so out of my mind bored. \r\n\r\n- I appreciated the guesture but clapouts are absolutely mortifying. This varies store to store, but I hate clapping on command (makes me feel like trained animal) and some stores have a prescribed DOUBLE CLAP!

Apple is hard to beat when it comes to them treating employees well from the pay rate and benefits included. Various perks for healthcare, 401K plans and other stock options, and other perks such as free software were really nice and helped employees feel more valued as opposed to just feeling like a number.\r\n\r\n* Discounts on Apple products and services (consisting of various set percentage discounts and one-time per 3 year discounts to get an even larger discount; really helps a lot when you want something new and shiny :) ).\r\n\r\n* Hours for work were almost always readily available - there are practically a near endless amount of overtime hour options available, and especially so during the holiday seasons or peak times such as a new product or major software update launch.\r\n\r\n* Being able to work from home is a huge perk! You never have to worry about any kind of dress code or commuting costs. In addition, Apple will reimburse you for your phone and internet bills monthly! \r\n\r\n* Apple regularly sends little freebie gifts to employees every few months or so. It's a really good feeling to open your mailbox and randomly receive a free gift such as a t-shirt, coffee mug, or jacket.\r\n\r\n* While you may not have a guaranteed job, as employees are regularly reviewed yearly on performance metrics, if you are able to meet these jobs there are certainly opportunities available for you. Those opportunities may manifest themselves as either job extensions in your current position, a pay raise, or perhaps a promotion to an entirely new role. One thing that I am happy to see Apple do is promote existing employees within their company rather than just look outward to find a candidate.\r\n\r\n* In a given work day as an employee, you usually learn something new. Even if you don't expect yourself to learn something a new, a new situation or customer type might throw your brain for a loop. I consider this element of uncertainty a positive, as I like taking on challenges and learning new things in the process.", "cons": "* Metrics performance goals are *FAR* too highly focused on and too micromanaged - you can be a fantastic employee at Apple, but if your metric numbers even look a little bit off in one area, expect to receive lengthy coaching from your manager. Management needs to realize that these numbers are largely out of control of the advisor, as the customer is the person with the ultimate say and can issue a rating that may or may not be appropriate for any or no given reason. In addition, metrics performance became practically impossible to achieve once management started issuing additional roles for the existing employees. For example - initially our team started off as T1 iOS advisors, where we would solely troubleshoot and help issues related to iOS-based products for the most part. However, over time once promotions came down the line, at the T2 level you are expected to act as a 'final point of contact' for customers regardless of their issue in the majority of situations. In addition, you take on additional products and services that you must be familiar with, and internal information is constantly being changed and updated which may lead to a different protocol for approaching certain issues. Not only that, but over time they expected all iOS advisors to be cross trained for Mac computer products as well - guess what that ended up doing? It ended up making every advisor be expected to know literally *everything* about practically every product and service, while drastically increasing the workload in any given day to the point where you never had a chance to take a breather. The T2 advisors were also being forwarded blind calls from T1 advisors, so these last two points significantly added onto the burden of the employee to the point where it becomes too much to handle.\r\n\r\n* Forget about having any kind of work/life balance. At Apple, your primary focus is always expected to be about the job and nothing else. Expect emails from management or pressure from your team manager to take on additional hours. While management will sometimes issue contests based on employees who take on additional hours, they are completely random as you would expect (given that there are thousands of employees on shift at any given time). In addition, your work schedule typically changes every 3 months in the role. Every 3 months, you will have to submit a new shift bid and *hopefully* get the appropriate days and times you're looking for.\r\n\r\n* At the T2 level especially, customers often tended to be rude. At the T1 level when I initially started off this issue was negated somewhat due to the larger influx of calls, but rude customers are to be expected in a customer service/technical support based role. To be fair, quite a few customers are also enjoyable to speak with. :)\r\n\r\n* This last point may or may not be an issue for employees, depending on the team that you are randomly placed into - during complex or difficult situations during a call, you may or may not be able to rely on support from your fellow team members/manager. Again, this point can be either a pro or con depending on the situation for the employee (I had both variants happen throughout my tenure at Apple)."}, {"review_title": "Apple 4 year review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Retail", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Company really care about the employees.

Forget about anyone listening to your ideas and expect to be talked down to all the time.  Next, and I think worst, there is such a strong desire by management to retain their jobs, and hopefully advance their careers, at a company name like Apple that they will do anything to make themselves look even greater than they act like they are.  So you will always fail to get a manager to listen to your explanation that an idea is bad.

In the spring, I was given another raise because of my performance.  And that was due to the fact, they kept training us and giving us lots of useful information to use out on the selling floor.

The fact is, Apple is only trying to make sure every customer gets the most out of the product.  They encourage us to ask lots and lots of questions to find out what the customer's needs are.  Our job is to let others know of the different services available to them.  If the customer finds that service useful, then they can use it.  Other employees feel like they are pushing people to buy stuff when they mention the services because they are not asking the right questions.  If I know a customer has been a Mac user for a number of years, then there might be some things I leave out that wouldn't really pertain to their needs.  If you make it a habit of talking to all your customers and mentioning everything, then the metrics take care of themselves.  I used to think it wasn't true, but it really is.  That's how I got about three raises in less than 2 years.  The only other thing I don't like about Apple is the fact that starting in November (around Thanksgiving), requesting time off is strongly discouraged until after January (because of Macworld).

The structure and hierarchy in the stores are unique to any retailer, making us the current envy of just about everyone.

It's a great feeling to work for a company that truly does change the fabric of peoples' lives, everyday.", "cons": "The atmosphere at Apple is never dull, and on days when most stores in the mall are dead, Apple is overflowing with people.  This is great, but is often hard to keep up with, making for a challenging working atmosphere.  The training process, though long, is at times not thorough enough, putting people on the floor to sell and answer questions who don't have a solid enough working knowledge of the product.  Another huge downside is Apple's \"closed-lip\" policy about its product development.  People expect us to know the latest scoop about what's coming out next or how something is changing, and it's frustrating that Apple works so hard to ensure that we're in fact the last ones to know.  In those terms, the lines of communication are unsettling.  Another disturbing thing to me is the fact that Mac Specialists are forced to compete in the \"numbers\" game with regards to the \"attachments\" that they sell with the computers.  This is how the company determines an employee's worth."}, {"review_title": "Awesome company, unforgettable experience, totally worthwhile endeavor.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "29 Apr 2008", "job_title": "Mac Specialist (Apple Store) in Burlington, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Apple doesn't just have employees; they have True Believers. Most people begin working for the company because they're long-term Apple customers. Some grew up hoping to work for Apple one day. It's exciting to be part of something that inspires awe, curiosity, and sometimes envy among even the most stubborn detractors. Working for a company that produces products and services you believe in is much more fulfulling than, for example, hawking hoochie halters at Hollister. Even as a part-time employee, there are supplemental 'perks' to the job, including discounts, weekly training on software packages, and sometimes, even product gifts. For example, during my tenure with Apple, employees were given the iLife software suite, a 30GB Video iPod, a shuffle, Parallels Software, and an 8GB iPhone - all completely free. While those gifts are absolutely welcomed by staff, that isn't what inspires such praise and loyalty. Many Apple employees feel almost like missionaries; we spread the word of Mac, explain how Apple products can improve peoples' lives, and instead of just handing them the 'fishing pole', we teach the customers to fish through online video tutorials, in-store demonstrations, workshops, and even personalized weekly one-on-one training sessions. Personally, I have witnessed everyone from suited businessmen to droopy-jean clad teens to technophobic senior citizens come into the store, use the products for themselves, and fall in love. What's really fun to see, though, is how surprised they are at their own enjoyment of the products. The look of unmitigated joy that spreads clear out to the corners of their mouths and beams right up to the corners of their eyes is not something I have found in any other job I have had. Apple doesn't just give people products; they give them feelings such as pride, confidence, excitement, joy, and yes, even 'coolness'.", "cons": "Depending on the store, management can make your life HELL. All the customer accolades, positive co-worker relationships, job competence, product knowledge, and above-average goal/metric achievement in the world will mean SQUAT if someone in management dislikes you. There's no recourse when it's your word against theirs, and the Apple concept of \"Fearless Feedback\" is a complete joke when your supervisor's favorite phrases include \"I'm not going to discuss that with you\", \"This isn't a conversation\", and \"I am not opening this to dialogue\". That said, I also know that leadership teams at some stores take a much different approach with their staff, and as such, a much more pleasant, positive work experience is provided. It's difficult to communicate effectively as a part-timer, as there is a company-wide moratorium on external communications. This is especially problematic when changes are made to the schedule mid-week, and you're notified only by email that can only be accessed from within the store, and you're not due in before your newly-scheduled shift. This could potentially be solved with the implementation of a secure, password-protected employee website that would be accessible from anywhere, wherein an employee could be notified of schedule changes or other crucial information."}, {"review_title": "If you have a passion for not only Apple but people, then this is the job for you.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 May 2008", "job_title": "Mac Specialist (Apple Store) in Lynnwood, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Personally, the best reason for me to work at Apple was that you get to be a part of something really fantastic. People are changing the way they run their lives, whether business, personal, or both. And often, you get to see things become easier for them by switching to a superior Operating System. Additionally, you get to meet people who share similar interests as you, especially in certain fields. (For example, this might just be that you enjoy using a Mac, but you also get to talk to a lot of people who use software that's Mac-only, like those many Music or Film production applications.) This is also a really great job for those who enjoy teaching. A lot of what you do there isn't as much selling as it is answering questions and solving problems. That can be really fun - especially if you can show them an easier way to accomplish something or fix a problem that they thought unfixable. When you do sell, it's not like other establishments where the pressure's on or you're dependent on commission. Also, the products kind of sell themselves. There's rarely a situation where you feel like you have to sell something you don't believe in. There's something right for everyone and part of the fun is helping someone find the right fit.", "cons": "If your management team isn't competent or trusting, just like any job, it can become difficult. At Apple, there's a lot of self-motivation. Meaning, for things to work well, you need to be able to take initiative.

Another downside of working at an Apple Retail Store is that it is a great job and a lot of people want to work there. Unfortunately, with such popularity comes a few bad apples (no pun intended) who can ruin the fun for others. There's been a lot of recent limitations instituted against Mac Specialists and it takes away from the atmosphere of trust.

People think it's cool, and it looks impressive on a resume. I loved almost everyone that I worked with. You need to have a certain attitude to work at Apple, and if you fit in then you just fit in. Don't get me wrong though--although they do look for a certain attitude, our team was very diverse. I met so many interesting people there, and i still keep in touch with many of them. Pay was pretty good compared to other mall jobs. Discounts here are okay but not amazing, though the free MobileMe account is definitely nice if you own multiple Apple products.", "cons": "Though I had lots of great customer interactions here, I also encountered a LOT of extraordinarily rude customers. I have had customers personally attack me (for example, dropping f-bombs on me when I told them that they'd need to wait 5-10 minutes to see a Genius, and telling me I'm incompetent even though fixing iPhones isn't in my job description) and almost cried in the Red Zone on multiple occasions. Managers push numbers hard--even though you don't make commission. We actually had a wall that had not only the best sales numbers for the day, but also the worst, which I find completely inappropriate. Totally inflexible scheduling. Although I was part-time, they worked me as many hours as possible and you need to request off work several months in advance, even if it's just one day. Then, my biggest gripe--there is literally no room for advancement here. They tell you that there is plenty of room to grow with Apple, but in reality, they hire outside the company for almost all of the management positions. There isn't much incentive to perform when there is little chance of growth. And forget moving to corporate--it's pretty much completely separate from the Retail division. Finally, the vibe here is (surprise, surprise) a bit cult-ish...there are special procedures for doing literally everything, even giving a compliment to your co-worker. You are expected to do your job and never, ever question the company or its motives. Plus, they've created this image for themselves that attracts all these ridiculously talented and educated people to work for them, when in reality they are vastly overqualified for their jobs. One coworker interned for NASA. Another was fluent in six languages. Yet another was an experienced music producer. And yet somehow they were all lured into working a shitty retail job--which, at the end of the day, is all this really is."}], [{"review_title": "Apple retail is by far, one of the better jobs I've had.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The staff is great.

If you have a heartfelt opinion that you think would benefit the team and the business (which I vividly remember Apple as a culture ENCOURAGING THIS) you're beaten down- they accuse you of being negative, lacking social tact (quoted- seriously!) and any chances for advancements quashed. The leadership team picks favorites and fosters this strange environment that makes you feel unwelcome, muffled and worthless. They seem to not like older people, particularly ladies- which I think is due to the feelings of one manager specifically who is quite obviously a misogynist. They also have a habit of creating their own policies outside of Apple corp's HR rules, such as vacations not exceeding 12 days (even though you can take up to 14.

Apple takes great care choosing it's employees which results in amazing teams of people which are greatly diversified but yet extremely cohesive.", "cons": "Apple's absence and attendance policy is not lenient enough.  It is far too easy to make an honest mistake like recording your next day's shift arrival time incorrectly only to find out upon your arrival at work that management made no bother to contact you.  When you're an hour late at Apple you are docked TWO points for a single occasion.  A third point with in a three month period puts an employee on final notice for an additional rolling six months.  No late, no sick, no emergencies or Apple will terminate!  \r\n     It seems that a week doesn't go by without some press release from Apple touting how amazing sales are currently going or recent quarter results have blown away last quarter results or how Apple has amassed even more millions to try and stuff into their already  over-flowing coffers.  Well, on the flip side not a week goes by in an Apple retail store where store management is pressured from above to keep the stores staffed with as few employees as possible.  The word \"utilization\" is constantly heard in the back halls of an Apple Retail Store.  The idea is that if the staff sees enough people per quarter; the store will be rewarded additional positions on different teams.  For example if the Creative team has X number of personal training and workshops consistently throughout a fiscal quarter, an additional Creative trainer will be added to that team.  The team's weekly goals are set before the quarter begins.  The team then sets out at the beginning of a quarter under the ruse that if the team works hard everyday and achieves these goals consistently then a new position will open to help with the constantly increasing workload.  One thing is for sure right now at Apple... More and more people are buying their products.  Foot traffic is increasing at an almost exponential rate; yet quarter after quarter with all or almost every goal met those promised additional positions barely trickle in or fail to materialize at all.  In the end the current employees continue to feel more and more pressure to stretch Apple's \"greatest resource, our soul, ...our people.\"  thinner and thinner to meet the increased business needs.   \r\n     As an Apple Family Room Specialist I find myself coming in contact and interacting with hundreds of people on a weekly basis.  During these interactions I may be fixing a device, replacing or swapping a device.  I may be teaching someone how to properly use their device.  Many times renewing a customer's faith in the product and the company that made it.  The role of the FRS has many hats sometimes.  If an FRS is Mac trained, but a Genius position hasn't opened up yet (see utilization rant in last paragraph) that FRS is expected to do all the duties a much higher paid Genius would have to do.  FRS's are also required to spend a great majority of their clocked in time performing the duties of a somewhat higher paid Creative.  All the training of the highest paid hourly positions, but your move from where you started at Apple up in the Red Zone as a Specialist back to the Family Room as an FRS in considered a \"lateral\" movement.  Lateral??!  How is this so?  FRS's have to attend specialized Family Room Foundations training to even achieve the FRS title.  A GYOG (Grow Your Own Genius) FRS has to take number of highly specialized certification exams before that FRS can take any Mac appointments.  Again, the FRS trains, obtains specialized skill sets that are then often called upon because non-GYOG trained FRS's cannot take MAC appointments.  The pay needs to reflect the training and know-how. Apple is capitalizing on this ambiguous nature of the FRS role.  Check into any Apple store's Family Room and this fact is plain as day.  FRS positions will out-number or even match the Genius and Creative positions when combined.  Good job Apple!
