However corporate finally reassessed the pay discrepancy and adjusted the pay for the veteran team members, but no retroactive adjustments were made.\n\nWork environment got worse with the pandemic. The retail stores are not safe. Being in Apple retail means you're constantly dealing with verbally and physically abusive customers and the police are frequently called to the store. Many are banned from the store but they come back frequently since there's no way to keep track of them. Many employees have been hit, threatened and spat on by customers, but the only changes that were made was to add an additional security guard in the store. Unfortunately, security guards are typically on their phone, talking to each other and not paying attention. \n\nBoth HR and leadership are not helpful and don't make any effective changes. \n\nApple retail is not like how it used to be. It's no longer a fun and bright environment. It's great for the first few months when you feel so much gratitude from all the benefits and the pay, but quickly that excitement will fade with the realization that employee safety is all fluff. \n\nMany retail stores are attempting to unionize and the leadership is desperately trying to union bust.\n\nThere's also a big disconnect between corporate and retail. Corporate makes a lot of decisions for all of Apple Retail without having an understanding of how retail works.\n\nWith that said, some stores are better than others.
