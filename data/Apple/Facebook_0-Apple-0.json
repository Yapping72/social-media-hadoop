Benefits are good. Work culture is better than most places, but maybe that is a myth in itself. Apple provides good facilities for employees to feel at home and break times to ensure that you are well rested throughout your shift. It is also frowned upon for employees to work overtime, so once you leave, you are left alone.\r\n\r\nSenior management and management - some really do care about your well being. They will go to extra lengths to make sure that you are feeling well. They keep the Store running and without them everything would collapse. Unlike a few who are greedy and results-driven (especially newer ones), i believe majority of them really really care about fellow employee well-being. Unfortunately they are handicapped by STORE LEADERS who are disconnected from team members on the ground and seem to be more interested in Corporate demands.", "cons": "The management, especially upper management is ruthless. There are some amazing people who are fighting for the rights of employees on the ground, but newer management has come in and totally ripped the heart out of the culture and ambiance of the Store. \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to trust someone to guide you with your career, because unfortunately this is not a career job, it is a stepping stone. You have to learn from experiences here and use them later on, this is not a place to work long term otherwise you will lose yourself under the pressure of providing top quality customer service day in day out. The customers are the least of the problem when it comes to Apple Staff, but rather CORPORATE because they are so greedy they will overflow the Genius Bar with SO MANY APPOINTMENTS that no human being will be able to even remember who she/he even is until they have left the building after their shift and have had a proper deep breath. That toxicity from the Genius Bar bleeds throughout the store, unfortunately CORPORATE DUMMIES don't understand that. I am writing all this with fear of losing my job, but someone has to step up. \r\n\r\nI have seen many staff crying secretly and suffering in silence because STORE LEADERS (those above management) are corporate puppets who will gladly sell their own CREW to please GREEDY CORPORATE VILLAINS. \r\n\r\nNot everyone in management is bad, some are trying their best to help people on the ground, attending to their needs. They know who they are. They will go to great lenghts to make sure that team members are safe and feeling happy to come to work. But they are humans who have their own families and burdens, how much more can they take? \r\n\r\nI feel sorry for them because they are bearing the burden of many people, they have a very difficult job. \r\n\r\n Unforunately STORE LEADERS and a select few in upper management (especially NEWER) alongside are too RUTHLESS and RESULT-DRIVEN. They have ruined the ambiance of the Store. They are also power hungry and like to micro manage everything that happens. That is why there is lack of innovation because a few people at the top want control over everything, the reality is they are disconnected from most people in the Store and couldn't care less. \r\n\r\nTeam members on the floor are afraid to speak up out of fear of losing their jobs."}, {"review_title": "apple", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Shift Supervisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good benefits, good pay yea", "cons": "tiring hours long but bareable"}, {"review_title": "company review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great culture, inclusive and diversity", "cons": "limited career development and skill training"}, {"review_title": "Best company I've worked for in my career to date", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Senior Systems Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great products, admired company, good work life balance, good stock options & refreshers", "cons": "Diversity, Communication, Dealing with ambiguity"}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "people focus culture. great benefits.", "cons": "need to work hard to get above average benefits"}, {"review_title": "Building the best version of yourself", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Analyst in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Great work life balance\r\n- Supportive Team\r\n- Compensation", "cons": "- Glass ceiling for non locals\r\n- Always evolving so you can get lost in all the updates"}], [{"review_title": "It was worth the experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Jun 2022", "job_title": "AppleCare Senior Technical Advisor in Ang Mo Kio New Town,", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work with as a whole", "cons": "Micro Management\r\nVery into Stats\r\nToo survey oriented - even if you did 0 mistakes"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work for", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Insights Manager in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Smart people\r\n- Challenging work\r\n- Focus on people development", "cons": "- Upward progression can be slow\r\n- Limited opportunities to move to a different function"}, {"review_title": "N/A", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Business in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Great benefit coverage \r\n-Stable business growth\r\n-Plenty of internal career opportunities", "cons": "no cons view could be provided"}, {"review_title": "Good for fresh graduate", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Allocation Execution Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good to learn new things, Good work life balance", "cons": "Things that learned only can be used in Apple"}, {"review_title": "Great culture and benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "29 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome leadership, career progression, dynamic environment", "cons": "Not a con to me, but for those not used to open feedback culture, be prepared to give and receive feedback regularly"}, {"review_title": "Great place and team", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "4 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Talent Acquisition Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great workplace and team;

They lie and exaggerate about your performance to managers.

I\u2019m not the only person with this experience. Another problem with one specific lead is her unprofessionalism. She treats female staff considerably different to how she treats make staff. It is disgusting. In my first interaction with her, I was new and I was nice. She was incredibly rude to me and I saw how she was with male staff and thought maybe I did something wrong. A few weeks later, I realised there was a pattern and almost every other female member of staff had a problem with this lead. Lots of micromanagement. The People team which is like HR, are very condescending. The overall vibe of the store is very fake nice. The staff that have worked there for years are either nice or extremely rude. You get questioned constantly when you take customers upstairs, to the point where a customer asked me \u201cwhy they [my colleagues] being so rude to you?\u201d There\u2019s a lot of cons working here especially with scheduling.

I keep in touch with some employees here and still hear the same nightmare stories. Enough is enough. Halifax deserves better, this store employs a lot of staff and some are scared to goto work and have to tip toe around. Apple is supposed to be a safe, diverse company. I heard one talk about how they were going to fire an employee on the sales floor. Instead of building people up, they want you to fail. Time to pay attention to some of your retail stores, especially this one. This is the face of the brand, and I can ensure you, it\u2019s not a good look.

There is a level of elitism with some customers that I haven\u2019t experienced in other jobs, both pre and post-employment with Apple. NPS: it\u2019s a useful tool to measure performance but too much stock is put into it considering how easy it is to drop a score. I\u2019ve had my NPS score drop because even though the customer said my service was \u201cimpeccable\u201d, the music in the store was too loud so they gave me a passive instead of a promoter. One detractor or passive survey drops a score so much that you have to get 5-10 promoters to make up for it. There is no appeals process to have the survey not count. It affects your numbers and can affect your raise/performance when review time comes around. Unrealistic expectations: I worked at the Genius Bar. By the time I left we were expected to take 3-4 appointments per hour where we were expected to not only troubleshoot/diagnose/resolve/check in for repair devices, but to also talk up AppleCare+, get a new business intro, talk about new products and upgrades, answer all customer questions, and learn/connect with the customer as a human. All of that CAN be done, but not in 15 minutes. That\u2019s 1-2 appointments per hour, not 3-4. It didn\u2019t matter how high your NPS or other metrics were, if you didn\u2019t hit that 3-4 appointments per hour you were constantly pulled into \u201cconnections\u201d with your connection leader to talk about it. Irritating. Leadership: inconsistent and very hit-or-miss. Some were very by-the-book and almost robotic, others were more human and understanding. Some had issues with micromanaging, no matter how many feedback conversations you had with them. Very few I felt I could actually trust. Lack of upward mobility: moving from specialist to expert is pretty easy. Anything beyond that gets significantly harder. Breaking into the corporate side is virtually impossible. Phone Support: there is a HUGE disconnect between phone support and store support. Phone support is awful, and they frequently lie and/or give incorrect information to customers, and store employees are left to clean up the mess and reset expectations."}], [{"review_title": "Apple", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Operations Specialist in Bridgeport, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing culture and benefits.

That co worker was set up and had all the evidence and they still chose to fire that employee. But the other party involved nothing was done to them and they broke business conduct. The other party she sent nudes to a coworker without asking, pursued the male coworker making it seem like she was interested in them, and would express how she liked them. To then claim she never was into them and there were messages to prove. But because the man did not make the claim and was manipulated into thinking he was liked he was turned on and terminated under wrongful terms."}, {"review_title": "Good working environment",

When I first started at Apple, it was only 1 chat at a time. It was increased to 3 fairly quickly but the chat quality standards never changed at all. You have 2 minutes to respond to every customer which is fine on one chat. But when you're on 3 chats at a time that means you have only 40 seconds per customer to read their message, research the answer, provide resources and explain the next step. It's nearly impossible achieve, let alone maintain for 8 hours. You're being set up to fail. Your entire life is scheduled down to the minute. You have to ask for any extra time you need away from your desk. For example, the day my dog was being put to sleep, I asked for an extra break to compose myself and was told I would need to clock out entirely for 15 minutes and take the time unpaid instead of just allowing me a small break while on the clock. At review time, you won't receive a decent raise unless you've \"Exceeded\" in all areas of your job but this is difficult to do when you have to ask/beg for time out of the chat queue to do special projects and make a name for yourself. It's entirely up to your specific manager whether you have the opportunity to succeed or not. Even when you are able to develop something to share with the area managers, they often drop the ball and your project goes nowhere or you find later that someone else is implementing the changes that you presented and you get no recognition for it. There's very little chance of being promoted up and out of the customer service side of the business as you won't be given the time or direction needed to improve your skills, mentor with other departments or receive any additional training outside of your role. Apple increasingly relies on vendors to provide their chat and phone customer service. The vendors have less training and are often coached to \"just send it to T2\" before they've even completed basic steps. Customers are frustrated because they spent time being transferred for a simple issue. As a T2 advisor, you then receive the customer's survey and you're scored down based on the actions of the T1 advisor. There is no way to reassign surveys even if the other advisor was mentioned by name and the survey clearly wasn't for you. Last year, Apple decided to move all of their internal chat advisors over to phone support. If you had an existing medical accommodation related to hearing loss or PTSD or anything else, you either had to give up your accommodation to make the move or find another job within the company that would accommodate you...which was impossible. I was put on a 30 day job search to do this and, despite a position being available for me to take that would accommodate me, I was not allowed to take it because the actual move to phone support was still upcoming. I would not be allowed into the open position until the day of the transition and the position closed before that date. I ended up reaching out to the EEOC about this who informed me that this is practice was NOT within the EEOC guidelines (An employee is supposed to receive the accommodation when THEY need it.. not when Apple needs it). Ultimately I left Apple because my last manager was extremely overbearing, very much a micro-manager and continually gave us tasks that would take us away from the chat queue but would refuse to give us additional time to complete them. Projects I had started on my previous team were taken away from me. Reports of system issues and downtime were not taken seriously and I constantly had to \"cover my Apple\" because any deviation away from your schedule was seen as suspicious. I recorded nearly 300 system issues resulting in downtime over a 2 year period complete with screenshots, screen recordings, internal IT tickets and personal notes but this was still not taken seriously. After asking multiple times (my area manager and HR) to be removed from this team, I was told that my manger was going on a rotation and I wouldn't have to speak to him again because of the move to phone support. However, my area manager then had him call me outside of work hours, while I was on medical leave, to ask me to login and work. I brought this back to my area manager who then responded by saying \"I didn't think it was so serious\".. despite my asking multiple times to be removed from a team being run by a person I found to be oppressive, hateful, and abusive. After leaving Apple, I spent about 6 months in therapy having been diagnosed with Major Depression and Agoraphobia (feeling unable to escape bad situations) caused directly by the interaction I had with the manager in question. Bottom line.. I was in an unhealthy and mentally unsafe environment and Apple REFUSED to do anything about it and even put me back into direct contact with the offender all the while ignoring and refusing to accommodate my medical status despite an option being open and available. One more thing (see what I did there?), Apple claims to believe in diversity and inclusion however this does not appear to extend to people with disabilities. Their D&L website only highlights their Black@Apple and LGBTQ+ groups. Folks with disabilities are ignored and simply not highlighted or even listened to."}, {"review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "23 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Work At Home Telephone Customer Service Representative in Limerick, Limerick", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- good benefits - salary increase", "cons": "- very little scope for progression - work from home/isolation"}, {"review_title": "Good benefits but bad job for long term", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Specialist in Miranda", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Good team - Easy work - Good benefits", "cons": "- Competitive - Benchmarked often - Extremely long hiring process"}, {"review_title": "Great College Job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "31 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Tech Expert in Center Creek, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "While there are some who make Apple retail their career, I think this is too high an expectation.

This company will eat your soul and spit it back at you, at least in hardware engineering. Management collectively uses fear and shame-based motivation.

As a DRI (directly responsible individual) you own everything and are expected to do everything, even though management may tell you that \"some things can fall through the cracks\". When you complain about \"quality of life\", they pretend to hear you, but will immediately try to convince you that you are wrong. The management actively gas-lights people when they complain, contributing the lack of time or bandwidth that one has to their own time management issues. Working here is like actively living in an insane asylum. There is no social life, it's just awkward, no one is encouraged to talk or socialize, just to get your work done. Pay is the only thing that keeps people here. For several years I have worked until 11-p or as late as 4am consistently for 4 days a weak, Fridays ending early sometimes as early as 6pm.
