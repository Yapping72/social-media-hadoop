From 9am- 1 pm there were self guided learning modules. And from 2 pm -6 pm there was role playing and advisor guided training.

First, I am currently a Senior Accounting major   who WAS scheduled to graduate in December 2015. I started the Spring 2015 semester but then withdrew after 2 weeks, after receiving notification that I was selected to start training  for Apple.\r\n\r\n  In addition to withdrawing from school this semester in order to \" work\" for Apple, I also quit the job I had for nearly a year in order to be able to \" work\" for Apple. I already knew that my old job would become a thing of the past due to Apple's better pay and benefits package. \r\n-\r\n   Not only did I withdraw from school, and resign from my old job in order to \" work\" for Apple; but I also declined another job offer that was made to me, prior to accepting the Apple \" job\" offer. \r\n\r\n\r\n Training was highly intense. From 9am- 1 pm there were self guided learning modules. And from 2 pm -6 pm there was role playing and advisor guided training. After 2 weeks of training, there was a test, where in order to pass, you must score an 80%. The test is timed with 20 questions on it. About 1/3 of the material on the test was not covered in training. Which is BEYOND unfair.  I took the test last night and scored a 70%. I was able to take the \" retest\" this morning and scored a 75%.\r\n\r\n  At this point I am waiting for the inevitable, for me to be informed I have been \" fired\". This experience that I've had, I would not wish on my worse enemy. To tell someone they're \" hired\" by Apple as an at home advisor is a scam. It's all a rat race to reel in as many unsuspecting \" applicants\" such as myself; issue too demanding exams with unrealistic passing requirements, and then surprise you with the \" you're fired\" line after 2 weeks!

I would not be surprised if they will outsource it too.\r\n\r\nWhen I started, we were supposed to support Pro apps/servers/SOHO integration.\r\nBy the end of the first year, 1 pro app was discontinued, the other two had very little call volume (meaning that only people using them privately knew how to support them), training for servers was left to people's goodwill (or naivety, depending on the point of view) since apple did not care about their servers and SOHO was a sorry joke about assisting old people resetting their routers.\r\nIf you have any skills, this position is a slap in the face, if not an hindrance to your career.\r\nUnsurprisingly, by the end of my second year, 94% of my team of 15 people had been replaced with much less skilled advisors, which are also payed less.\r\n\r\nDuring the week, 90% of your daily activity at apple will be trying to \"convince\" people with blocked phones that the consumer- hostile policy you are trying to push their way makes sense, all the while repeating nonsensical pre-written statements about how happy you  are the customer is using apple.\r\nAnd don't forget to ALIGN! whatever that means. \r\nYou work on Saturday/Sunday for no reason, since the kind of service does not require availability, and you get maximum two calls (about locked phones). \r\nEnjoy sitting there for hours doing nothing on the weekend.\r\n\r\nNowadays, it is just call after call from angry people forcefully transferred by the outsourced t1, which uses every possible excuse to transfer enraged people your way, just to avoid getting a bad survey.\r\n\r\nThe training provided is cheap, in particular after the few experts have been forced to leave, and also totally for your own development useless  you want to stay in that same position your entire life.\r\nYou can get their certifications but you will not really be able to use them outside of apple. You should really put all your efforts into taking a couple more expensive certifications from other vendors and then just leave.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that  many people are buying into the rationale that being part of a big company gives them prestige or personal value, apple will always have a cohort of drones ready to replace the ones that open their eyes and leave. \r\nHaving some sort of public persona (like being part of some public organization or organizing public events) will boost your career incredibly, since apple will be able to put their hat on it, while doing 0 for it.  In that case, you will be promoted as soon as it is technically possible, which means 6 months.\r\nAs a consequence, career paths are 100% reliant on your social skills and 0 or your actual skills/work ethic.  \r\nIt has become a recurring joke with one of my ex colleagues (an engineer) which applied to a position, only to have a guy flipping burgers in mcDonalds being hired instead of him.\r\n\r\nThe people working there are among the worst I have ever met.\r\nCronyism is rampant, with people referring relatives/friends and then giving each others kudos in the end of the year review or abusing the WOW, to boost their stats and be promoted.\r\n\r\nSome will go out of their way to downplay others, quite often starting real wars between teams to either make themselves look better or to diminish other people's results.\r\nManagers using WhatsApp to discuss work related matters.\r\n\r\nTeam nights were relatives/partners are invited.\r\n\r\nOne thing I have never seen anywhere else that often  happens in apple is that someone will make up an issue and its solution, and then go around advertising the fake issue as the most important and critical of all. Then of course they come up with the solution and they get credited by their managers, which are not going to waste time trying to double check facts.\r\n\r\nSome other people have built their careers by rewriting public facing articles in the internal wiki and \"selling\" them as their own original work to their managers.\r\n\r\nUnless you want to live in Cork, which is a nice city but does not offer much, you can only work from home.\r\nIf you work from home, your career chance reaches negative values.  You are going to be cut off from any social activity and be checked for every action. There is no way for you to be moved to the office unless you move to another department, which will not consider your application unless you are already in Cork.\r\nJust don't do it.\r\n\r\nAny kind of criticism is heresy and will turn you into an outcast.\r\n\r\nThe salary is lower than the market average, which they try to even out by giving you a discount on their product every 3 years and a couple of shares every year. \r\n\r\nOne of their benefits should be paying for your training/certifications, but they only pay you Apple certifications from Pearsonvue, which they later do not allow you to have on your personal account, so keep that piece of paper safe since there is no way to get a duplicate or a link to it.\r\n\r\nThey will use leftovers from the kitchen to have \"free food\" events for employees. Enjoy your diarrhea. \r\nThe food is expensive and the quality is poor.\r\n\r\nYou are forced to watch their boring commercials during team meetings and pretend you like them."}, {"review_title": "Management is under qualified.

Customers regularly wait 20-30+ minutes just to get the opportunity to talk to someone to buy something. This can even happen if the person knows exactly what they want, has no questions, and is ready to pay. That stress is directly put on you as leadership hides behind an iPad or in an office but tells you to work faster from afar. \r\n- Apple's goal is to positively impact humanity but they seem to forget their own employees are part of that humanity. Your career ambitions are ignored, favoritism is rampant, they put more and more pressure on their people while giving them less and less resources to deal with it.\r\n- Their promotion practice is hidden and vague so that they can always make up excuses about why you aren't ready to get promoted. There are no clear metrics or avenues for job growth just management preference and their favorites are forced to the front of the queue while much more capable and deserving team members are passed over. When you're told you're not able to interview for a new position or promotion they make up reasons like \"what books are your currently reading about self development?\" or other vague open ended questions that have no right answer because whatever you say they will tell you its not good enough.\r\n-It is a regular practice that they will handpick people for promotions, interview them, and give them the job before they even let the team know the job is available. The day the job is posted is the same day they tell the staff someone already got the position. It's ok that they choose who they think is ready for promotion but the hidden nature of the process makes it look like under the table deals and favoritism is the only way to get ahead.\r\n- Apple has the clout to hire managers etc from outside of the company in a job role far below their last job. This means department store general managers and district managers are regularly hired as entry level managers at Apple (2 to 3 steps below their past position at their prior job). This makes an impossible void for anyone internally to get promoted to management. You're essentially shown that you need to be able to run 8-12 stores on your own before you can be moved up to be a basic manager at Apple. They give no opportunity for people to exhibit these skills internally so there will always be a very large divide between what they expect and what they allow internal candidates to show the competency for. This means that you're far more likely to move up at Apple by leaving the company, getting promoted elsewhere, and then coming back several years later to take a step down in role when you return.\r\n- Managers do very little to support the sales floor and technicians throughout the day.

I feel almost embarrassed that I'm holding a bachelor's degree from a top university, but I'm surrounded by dull people who do nothing all day but play video games and sleep. You cycle through managers and teams, shift schedules, even entire job roles wlly-nilly, without any input on your part.\r\n\r\nThere is really no interest in the satisfaction of the customer. It's all about the metrics. You can have stellar reviews from customers, and documented peer feedback from other departments bragging about you, but if you can't average out a 15 minute phone call time to fix the endless list possible issues that can go wrong with a computer, then you're in the hot seat. Don't \"fix\" your behaviors in 3, 6, then 7 months and you're probably going to be canned. So it's either be curt, and frankly rude, to a lot of the people that buy products from you, or fall down the totem pole in the staff rank and get stuck working a late night shift the next time shift bids come around, which will make good performance tougher, your personal life lonelier, all while any recommendation for a change in the operating procedures is balked at by management.\r\n\r\nOne is expected to clock-in and immediately start taking calls. 60 seconds is expected between hanging up one call, finishing the case notes, and taking your next call. Any time over 5 minutes will have you speaking with a supervisor. I once had my pay revoked for taking 20 minutes to check email and get situated before logging into the call queue. And even if you're not completely hoarse and exhausted from a nonstop cycle of calls, you will be pressured, and by that i mean threatened with zero consideration for future upward movement, if you do not partake in at least 6 hours per week of overtime during the busy season, which is about 5 months out of the year.  I stopped caring when I realized I was spending my extra money from OT on prescription painkillers for my back from being chained to a desk every solitary second for 7.5 hours (that's a day minus 1 hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks). Also during this busy season, you will experience cancellation of team meetings, training seminars, or any other offline time that might have given you a moment of rest from the endless work or time to work on a side project that you could use to show your skills to other areas of the company.\r\n\r\nSum of the story: you are paid to do exactly one job and one job only and you're not allowed to do or think anything else besides that one job.

Get prepared to justify why so. \r\nThe \"office\" you will work in is a massive open space, countless people on the phone, which creates quite a noise at times. \r\n\r\nThese are all things I could have lived with - but:\r\nThe Wellness centre doctors are completely useless. If you have a medical condition and need to urgently see a specialist, get comfortable. You will wait at least half a year.  You think you need urgent medical assistance? You probably don't, according to the doctors there. Referral to specialists because you suspect an allergy or have developped weird symptoms? Feel like you need to see a psychologist? Don't expect them to offer you a referral. Also, make sure you book your appointments OUTSIDE your work time - if you can. Or book a holiday to see a doctor.\r\nDon't expect any special treatment if you have a medical condition that would require you to leave your desk sometimes. \r\nDO NOT listen to any promises you are made by any recruiter regarding health care and medical care if you have a medical condition. I had to find out the hard way.\r\nThe recruiter's selling point is the \"added benefits\" but also their \"relocation package\" where you will be offered some money to move, just enough to make your way up here and start a living. By the way, you have to pay all that back once you decide to leave. \r\nAfter you have been recruited and have made your way to the headquarters, you will never hear from your recruiter again. You are angry because nobody is there to talk to? Nobody is there to answer your questions? To take responsibility for what you have been promised? To refer you to a doctor or tell you how to get started? Sorry, that's not included in Apple's generous benefit package. \r\n\r\n\r\nOh, and good luck finding accommodation in Cork!"}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 May 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "After contracting with Apple a few years ago, I decided to go back to school to finish my bachelor's degree.

What are the issues? Oh gosh, no idea where to begin. Simply put, it is career suicide. If you are offered the iOS App Reviewer position or any other position in this department, deny it & look somewhere else. \r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s get into the details...\r\n\r\nThe only pros are:\r\n\r\n- Classy Apple badge\r\n- 401K match & health insurance \r\n- Employee discounts \r\n\r\n*These are the perks for now, but will likely change in the future", "cons": "- Apple culture does not exist here, but instead a toxic culture does! If you are expecting to work for Apple and experience real Apple culture, this place is not for you. The sole purpose of this job is to clock in, sit at your desk for 10 hours, and be a darn robot by simply just approving/rejecting apps all day, every day. Additionally, it is a very toxic/soulless culture since there is an incredible amount of negativity created among employees due to the way management treats its employees. It is to the point where people are even scared to talk to each other during the day since management has created a culture of fear...\r\n\r\n- Career suicide. Whether this is an early job in your career or a job taken on later in your career, it is career suicide. There are zero transferrable skills you will gain from this job. Your best bet out of this organization is to go gain new skill sets on your own. \r\n\r\n- Management\u2019s idea to ensure employees are productive is to micro management them like no other. Your clock in/clock out times, breaks, computer activity, and the amount of time you spend in the bathroom are monitored down to the minute. If management feels you are in violation of any of these categories, be prepared to get talked to/monitored consistently even if you are an employee that gets work done on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nYou as an employee must salute management at all times. Unreal. This style of management is a very childish way to manage adults and such micro management tactics breaks an organization, creates a toxic culture, & makes employees rebel against each other. Due to this, you have a team where 200+ people are looking for jobs all at once, which is not something you see often...\r\n\r\n- Lack of real managerial experience, arrogance, & competence among management is a huge problem. Employees on this team have some basic ideas to solve the organization\u2019s problems, but the lack of real management experience, arrogance, & competence at a management level makes it impossible for changes to occur. If you have any ideas, they are simply not welcomed and will be shot down by management instantly. Essentially, you as an employee must accept management\u2019s stupid ideas or go take a walk.\r\n\r\n- Employee appreciation? Pffftt. What\u2019s that? In this org, you are treated worse than animals. It is all about work! work! work! As mentioned earlier, you are a robot tied to your desk for 60/hours a week with zero flexibility in work hours. Also, expect to work six days a week all the time, work 12 hour days often, & be *forced* to work every national US holiday. Additionally, management simply does not believe in retaining its employees, giving their employees rest, & thanking employees for their hard work. Management has even taken away company events from its employees. Instead, the philosophy is to throw more work at them until they burnout & quit.\r\n\r\n- Taking a vacation & falling sick in this department are considered to be a crime. If you as an individual wish to take a vacation, good luck ever getting the time approved. Everyone\u2019s vacation time is closely monitored and it is up to the department\u2019s discretion to decide if you are allowed to go on a vacation during the dates of your choosing. \r\n\r\nAlso, during fall employees are told there is a strict \u201cvacation blackout\u201d period, which means you cannot take a vacation during September - December due to \u201cbusiness needs\u201d. Such a restriction ensures employees can never enjoy a Thanksgiving or Christmas with their loved ones, which is cruel and inhumane. In addition, if you ever fall sick and can\u2019t make it to work, expect your manager to guilt trip you for being sick the day you come back.\r\n\r\n- Career growth? Ha, good luck. Expect zero guidance from anyone in  management on how to grow your career within the company. During your time in this department, you are expected to be an approve/reject robot & nothing else. In fact, many other departments at Apple have figured out the ugly truths of App Review, which make it almost impossible to transfer internally. If you do join this department, your best bet is to look at another company for a job.\r\n\r\n- Nepotism like no other. In this department, the ones that get elevated are the ones that simply suck up to management & become close friends with them. If you are a hard worker on this team, you\u2019ll simply be told to do more until the life is sucked out of you. Competence is not a required skill set to get elevated in this org."}, {"review_title": "Technical Specialist repairs relationships while find solutions to repair devices for customers", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Sept 2018", "job_title": "Technical Specialist in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You become family with your store.

Taking the time, making sure the customer had all the attention you can give them without being rushed into your next appointment . Nowadays, its all about enriching their pocketbooks and numbers ! Here are the core CONS that you will encounter ; Let me break it down : \r\n \r\n\u2022 A billion dollar company that LOVES to have short staffing. Apple refuses to put enough people on the sales floor. Ive seen frustrated customers wait impatiently for someone to help them purchase a computer yet THERE'S NO SALES PEOPLE TO HELP and they storm out of the store pissed off instead !! Yup ! There goes that sale ! Way to go APPLE !!!!!\r\n \r\n\u2022 Everyone wears blue shirts . Its hard to distinguish who the technicians are and who the sales people are . a unified color of the shirt simply means EVERYONE IS EXPECTED TO PRETTY MUCH DO EVERYTHING no matter what position you have. Job Description ? There is NO SUCH A THING IN APPLE RETAIL . ( read on )\r\n\r\n\r\n* GENIUS BAR / FAMILY ROOM ( aka the technical support area ) is all about NUMBERS. You are put on a queue where you are seen by a technician. You basically have 10-15 minutes with this customer and YOU MUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. Most stores require you to have an appointment booked ahead of time, and recently, its become standardized that ALL APPOINTMENTS MUST BE TAKEN. The genius bar is now cleverly crafted with new stations that ' get you started ' . No appointments ? sure just sit down and a technician will take a look and see if they can do the task for you. This basically allows more traffic to come through and more appointments to be taken. ( btw management WE'RE NOT STUPID !!! )  Work has been quadrupled to the point you are running around with your head about to fall off ! This department would work so well but the management will not put enough people to help out throughout the day ! The worst part about being in this department is breaks and lunches are always never taken on time !!!! You will basically end up hating your co workers for taking too long in their interactions or for them to refuse to help out because they are doing computer repairs. It just flat out SUCKS . This is the worst level of stress you will receive in the store . There's not a day I come home from work, not only physically exhausted but MENTALLY abused from all the things you go throughout the day !  l \r\n\r\n* THE CREATIVE STUDIO ( aka one to one training ) will test your PATIENCE .\r\n\r\nYou will teach 70-80 year old customers who just purchased a computer and will end up coming back for repeated sessions for the next couple of weeks because they cant remember their passwords ! \r\n\r\nIf you are extremely patient, well good luck cuz you're going to need it real badly when you're in this role !!!! Id say a good 10% of the sessions you will get are actual decent individuals who can grasp and learn what you teach, the other 90% will just be useless people who are just basically wasting their time ( AND YOURS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT ) . \r\n\r\n* The customers, especially the pissed off ones,can be a handful. Be prepared for an earful. Most are nice but majority are prissy, stuck up people who will EXPECT you to bend over and squeeze them in to have their iphone fixed ahead of everyone else.

There was a person who I worked with that loved his job. He stayed late nights working and did everything he was told to. He was one of the most compassionate and caring person I have ever met. He had a lovely kid and a wife. A few months later he passed away. At that moment I realize life can be gone at any second, and many people don't realize that the current moment it's your most valuable moment. A few days later I found out that they were trying to fire him for a long time ago for a system that its structure was design only for better performance that makes more revenue. This system goes so far that ignores any kind of good talent or people that actually care about helping others. It also ignores any work life balance because of the needs of the company.

Depending on your specific location, starting and entry level roles will earn between $18-$19 per hour. Each role above entry level pays you 10-20% more based on performance and tenure. If you are full-time, expect to be earning between $21-$25 an hour within just a couple of years.\r\n- Annual pay raises (Apple calls them \"merit increases\" are typically generous, but are determined based on the stores overall performance metrics. Expect a minimum annual raise of 2-5%. \r\n- Restricted Stock Units (RSU's) are available and are gifted to ALL employees, part-time, full-time, entry level and beyond. These are free stock gifts that vest over a three year period. Expect somewhere around $2000 and up per year, this is an AWESOME benefit.\r\n- Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP) offers you a 15% discount off of Apple stock which you use to purchase shares twice per calendar year. This is another AWESOME benefit. In my time at Apple, I saw this benefit alone make colleagues millionaires. I mean that. If you invest right and are with the company for the longterm, Apple's ESPP can make you a millionaire. \r\n- Overall benefits package is truly exceptional. This is the number one reason to work for Apple and/or Apple Retail. Health benefits are exceptional and affordable. Dental and vision are much the same. A ton of benefits exist for continuing your education, growing your financial portfolio, health and wellness and more. Taking full advantage of the benefits package will only help reward you further for your work done at Apple.\r\n- Discounts on Apple products is exceptional. At least 25% off of everything (often times much more) for your personal purchases, at least 15% off of everything for friends and family. Additional \"third party\" discounts on accessory products, camera equipment, cellular service, rental car services, concierge services, auto loans, and so much more are also available. \r\n- 401k match is decent, up to 6% dollar for dollar once you have been with the company five years.\r\n- Paid time off for full-time employees is decent with added \"bonus\" days added each year. Paid time off increases at the five year, ten year and fifteen year mark with the company. \r\n- Every employee receives sick time. Yes, part-time employees too.", "cons": "- If you get hired at Apple, come in thirsty. Real thirsty. You're going to be drinking a TON of Kool-Aid. Throughout your on boarding and training experience you will be forced to drink Kool-Aid, swallow it and gulp down some more. You will be expected to sing the companies praises at every turn. This will not change, either be ready for it or you will not last.\r\n- Management varies greatly by location, but is in general, a sad, poor excuse for a \"leader\" (they give themselves this title, it is not earned). You will, without question come across the occasional member of management of \"gets it,\" these men and women will make a profound impact on you. Sadly, they are far and few between and the rest of the junk will win out.\r\n- Nearly everyone is hired in at the entry level roles (Specialist or Technical Specialist) and nearly everyone promotes quickly (usually once per year for the first two or three years). Once you have two or three promotions under your belt, typically just beneath the management level, your development with COMPLETELY STALL. The \"elevated\" positions (in order: Pro, Lead, Lead Genius, Manager, Senior Manager, Store \"Leader\") are limited and competition for them is stiff. If you land one of these \"elevated\" roles, get comfortable. You will be in it for a WHILE. YEARS.\r\n- Store \"Leaders\" are NEVER in the building. Senior Managers typically run the day-to-day store operations.\r\n- Turnover is incredibly, ridiculously, annoying high. If you get hired, please expect roughly 35-40% of your location to completely turn over per year. You will see a huge hiring increase around the fall and holiday period, hiring will stop around the New Year, people will drop like flies until the next fall, process starts over again.\r\n- Work/life balance is a joke. Do not expect to have it. Do not expect to get any holiday's off, do not expect scheduling to do you any favors. Time off requests have to be made 4-5 weeks in advance and if you want any chance of actually getting the time approved, request it 8-10 weeks in advance. As a result of new product launches, do not even think of asking for ANY time off in September, October or November, EVER. \r\n- Development is a joke.\r\n- Internal politics are EVERYTHING at Apple. You MUST \"play the game.\" \r\n- Time and attendance policy is a JOKE. There is no penalty for being late, calling off, missing work. Other team members will take advantage of this and will leave you stranded.\r\n- A ton of \"rules\" are in place with management that will greatly impact you. A person can only be in a role for so long (they want you to move, up and laterally, often). Expect to be in any one role for just about a year until you are pushed into something else. Please note, often times these are NOT promotions but lateral moves to \"add tools to your tool belt.\" Apple's \"culture of feedback\" is a genius and evil way of ALWAYS having a justified way to pushback against your plans, development, hopes and more. EVERYTHING at Apple can be looped back to feedback, be prepared to ask management for something and for them to respond with feedback on how you need to improve first. This is a cycle, it happens over and over again.\r\n- If you push back against the \"Apple way,\" be prepared to be forced out. ALWAYS ask for and accept feedback. Always speak highly of Apple products. Always support and get behind new services and initiatives. Always defend the customer, never your colleague. Always smile and nod. Never show frustrations, disappointment or anger.

You can earn a max of about $500 per month based on customer feedback.  Exact amount depends on customer ratings and number of reviews received.  However, management makes it clear through periodic reminders that if you miss any time at work for any reason, you are displaying a poor work ethic and will lose your earned bonus.   A sick day costs you the entire bonus for the month, even if it's the last day of the month and you were about to qualify for the maximum bonus.  Lateness to work for any reason, even a legitimate one like a car accident costs you a significant portion of the bonus.  I have been with mothers as they sobbed in the break room, because they have to leave work in the middle of the day to take care of a sick child, knowing that they will lose their bonus money and will struggle to be able to pay the child's doctor.\r\nApple management actually states in writing that  \"it is always your choice if you don't come to work and you are showing a poor work ethic if you don't\".  Legitimate sickness, legitimate child care issues, any legitimate reason for absence is not accepted.  Because of the significant drop in earnings, people usually don't stay out when they're sick; colds and flu are rampant in this workplace.\r\nFurthermore, the requests for feedback about your work that Apple e-mails to customers do not mention your name, or the topic that was discussed during the telephone call.  Quite often the customer reviews someone other than you, e.g. a previous agent they were dissatisfied with, or a Mac Genius at the Apple Store you referred the caller to.  So even if you did a great job, you get a bad review on your record.  This reduces the percentage of good feedback for the month and drops your bonus.  Apple does not remove these mistakes from your record.  Management says \"you get some good ones and some bad ones.\"  In other words, tough s***.

Good technical ability and customer service is not valued or appreciated by management. They only care about how many customers we can see per day.

The heat is unbearable working here, even in winter.  Wearing apple shirts is mandatory but each employee is given just 2 t-shirts (1 long sleeve and 1 short sleeve) This is not sufficient as we need to change/wash these daily due to all the perspiration in the unbearable heat in this store. Several coworkers here also use bully tactics. They are 2 faced and like to send nasty emails to management with \"feedback\" on new employees in particular.  The only company i have worked in where it is \"mandatory\" to attend \"out of store social events\" These occur several times per year and any employees who dont attend receive an \"attendance occurance\" (its classed as being the same as calling in sick due to illness). We are expected to attend these even if they are scheduled on our day off....

It is clear that not only it is  a cult (think of Goebbels scale propaganda events), they appear to want to be relevant to every disaster there is - using events as an excuse to pat themselves on the back for answering a few goddamn phone calls. I quit in disgust at not only this but the behaviour that I witnessed. \r\n\r\nThey promise you a permanent contract, however it is not worth the paper it is written on. Some advice; when working for an American company, always, ALWAYS have a backup plan. I had already worked for a few Yank companies so was feeding my resume out even after hire, I had something to go onto, many don't.  They will lure you in with a relocation package, then illegally send you documents that they want you to sign AFTER relocation and the commencement of the job. What is in these documents? Backdated forms stating that if you sign you will pay them back every penny of relocation if you quit within 12 months, essentially you're an indentured slave for that 12 month period. I didn't sign. Others did as they did not know what and why they were signing as they could not understand the papers. They were fired later and  walked away with nothing. \r\n\r\nApple will hold your contract over your head and basically blackmail you. If you don't meet their \"stats\" (which, by the way are rigged), they'll threaten you, then blackmail you with ending your contract then threaten you some more. It's laughable that they seem to think this is appropriate management strategy or conduct.\r\n\r\nThey will also illegally deduct things from your wages -make sure if you work here you check your paystubs EVERY month. Also make sure that you're familiar with employment laws in the country you're working for. Apple seem to think they are above the law, they're not and I had to seek legal advice whilst working for them.\r\n\r\nYou're also not able to speak freely to anyone, they cultivate a very 1984 vibe. Always look over your shoulder, the smallest thing will be taken out of context and repeated to management. They encourage people to crawl over the dead bodies of their comrades in order to get ahead, think \"corporate hunger-games\", it's disgusting.\r\n\r\nAs for management, walking adverts for psychopathy if ever I have seen one.  All management care about is themselves, it's not what you know it's who you know, so most management are busy climbing up the back holes of the people above them. They'll promise you career growth but the reality is, there is none. It's more of a sideways shuffle. \r\n\r\nThere's no room for thought or creativity, they're just looking for automatons, drones if you will.  It's quite disturbing observing the vapid gazes, backstabbing and culture of fear that permeates the place. Think legitimized scientology if you want an idea on how it is to work there. ..and for some weird reason they think it's appropriate to bribe workers with candy. Candy. I work for money not flipping candy. There's a tendency to infantilise the worker.\r\n\r\nAnd sexism. lots of misogyny and sexism. They just pay lip-service to their anti-discrimination policy (and if you declare a pre-existing condition to your manager, be prepared to have this work against you in direct contravention of anti-discrimination laws, not their policy, but actual laws).\r\n\r\nIt's terrible. Absolutely terrible (think eight minutes allocated in the day to pee terrible), so think long and hard about working there before you apply and think \"am  just able to use them and get the experience I need and get out without having my soul crushed?\" before you even sign the contract.  \r\n\r\nThey bank on their reputation to get young ones in, then chew them up and spit the out, the incidents of depression and depressive behaviour in the call centres are HUGE. If you value your individuality, mental health and humanity, look elsewhere for work. \r\n\r\nI do realise that they pay people to flood these sites with glowing reviews, so if you've made it this far then clearly you shouldn't be applying."}, {"review_title": "It's not bad, but it's not good either.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Apr 2018", "job_title": "Product Zone Specialist in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working part time gives really flexible hours. \nStock.\nProduct discounts. \nTalented group of coworkers.\nAbility to work in different departments.", "cons": "Very little room for development. \nA lot of favoritism. \nUnfair pay. \nBe aware that number of hours available fluctuates with retail seasonal."}, {"review_title": "Life changing place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "8 May 2018", "job_title": "Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Apple was an incredible place to work at, meeting people all parts of the globe.

You basically have to live and breathe it at every moment, on the clock or off. Forced overtime during releases or holidays. Passive aggressive management techniques designed to make you feel guilty for missing work. Revolving door of employees because of nearly unobtainable requirements set by management. Training had a lot of bumps in it, not because of the trainers, but the lack of material. I mentioned holidays before. You might as well forget seeing your family if you have to travel. No time off is allowed during the winter holidays. Zero, none, even if you have planned a year in advance. Overtime is often forced even during the weeks with holidays so you have even less time off for your families. When you express any concern over these practices the management takes you aside to remind you that only the customer is important and that you agreed to work any times the office was open. Speaking of time away from family, if you get assigned to a special project prepare to work 60+hours a week. Management becomes aggressive when you aren't performing to specific standards and this can sometimes lead to 20-25% turnover in a given month. In fact, less than 5% of my starting group lasted more than 90 days. Busy work is given almost daily, which interferes with work operations. Any new training is given via these ridiculous online courses or through a very brief summery in an online meeting (Webex). Worst of all, sometimes it is given out via email with little explanation of policy changes. Attendance is always an issue and with little wiggle room, no manner your tenure.\r\n\r\nI guess the best summary is they put product and capitol far above their employees worth, like most businesses, but without a real pretense of caring. Low pay, long hours just to have Apple on your resume probably isn't worth it since most companies of the caliber pay more with better incentives.

You basically have to live and breathe it at every moment, on the clock or off. Forced overtime during releases or holidays. Passive aggressive management techniques designed to make you feel guilty for missing work. Revolving door of employees because of nearly unobtainable requirements set by management. Training had a lot of bumps in it, not because of the trainers, but the lack of material. I mentioned holidays before. You might as well forget seeing your family if you have to travel. No time off is allowed during the winter holidays. Zero, none, even if you have planned a year in advance. Overtime is often forced even during the weeks with holidays so you have even less time off for your families. When you express any concern over these practices the management takes you aside to remind you that only the customer is important and that you agreed to work any times the office was open. Speaking of time away from family, if you get assigned to a special project prepare to work 60+hours a week. Management becomes aggressive when you aren't performing to specific standards and this can sometimes lead to 20-25% turnover in a given month. In fact, less than 5% of my starting group lasted more than 90 days. Busy work is given almost daily, which interferes with work operations. Any new training is given via these ridiculous online courses or through a very brief summery in an online meeting (Webex). Worst of all, sometimes it is given out via email with little explanation of policy changes. Attendance is always an issue and with little wiggle room, no manner your tenure.\r\n\r\nI guess the best summary is they put product and capitol far above their employees worth, like most businesses, but without a real pretense of caring. Low pay, long hours just to have Apple on your resume probably isn't worth it since most companies of the caliber pay more with better incentives.
