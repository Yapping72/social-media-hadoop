The wealth of personal and job growth someone can have working at Apple is unrivaled at any other company.  Apple employees, due to excellent training and a stringent selection process are highly skilled and personally well rounded, if not from the moment of hire, they will become that way within the first year of working in the Apple environment.  Apple provides a sort of education that can't be learned anywhere else.  \r\n\r\nEmployees are paid well for retail.  There are frequent opportunities for lateral movement in the store, and opportunities to \"intern\" or work temporarily at corporate.", "cons": "In a crowded retail environment where employees often get sick from their customers / the public, Apple has an attendance policy that severely punishes employees for taking sick days.  Because of this, most employees come to work sick [and sometimes injured], especially during flu season and the holidays, to avoid being penalized.  This, in turn, gets more people sick.  During the holidays, 30-50% of the employees in the store will be at some degree of ill, many repeatedly re-catching illness from other co-workers.  \r\n\r\nUpwards mobility is limited.  Apple often hires outside manager candidates with little or no experience working in the store and places them in a position to manage people far more experience than them.  Apple also has policies in place to prevent managers from building a human connection with the people they manage, such as preventing the few internally hired managers from working with previous co-workers, and preventing managers from having any social interaction with non-management employees outside the store.  As a result, managers form their own \"social click\" like the the \"cool kids in high school\" that is entirely detached from the rest of the store."}, {"review_title": "6 years of amazing yet tough experiences", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Jan 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working for this company for 6 years has definitely let me expand my resume with experiences I would have never received outside of Apple especially within a 6 years time frame. I do feel as thought I had a lot of promotional opportunities in retail until I reached Genius. Then I transferred to corporate and realized how specified each job role was and that people were in one position for up to 15 years. Great that means job security but kind of scary that promotions or even lateral moves didn't happen to expand their knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\n Apple has incredible perks such as amazing employee discounts for Apple and 3rd products, free public transportation, bike, gym membership, and school reimbursement, and of course great employees.

Many co-geniuses on my team (at 3 different stores) felt as though we were loosing our ability to surprise and delight customers and make sure their issues were resolved because we were being rushed to take more appointments and do a sloppy job which made many customers unhappy. This caused for many of us feel good geniuses to feel like we were scum of the earth. I also wish bonuses and pay raises reflected what you did instead of what the sales people did especially because we were certified technicians  who are or went to school for information technology and it would have been nice for Apple to compensate us as so."}, {"review_title": "A stressful but rewarding position with one of the most highly thought of employers.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Mac Genius in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The culture is amazing if you are in the right store.

There are situations where you have to get a leader or security guard because of customers' temperament. Over time some people get \"burned out\" and should leave or move on, but sadly they don't. It's difficult to get fired when working for Apple so people who are content in their positions do what is necessary to stay, but have very little drive. This can be difficult on the people who are trying to grow with the company. Trying to improve numbers on the team can end up being a 1 person job (which, in turn, burns out that individual).

I particularly learned a lot about communication skills and positioning of a product/ topic a certain way. Taught me a lot about patience, tolerance, organization, loyalty, and teamwork.", "cons": "Growth, particularly in retail was extremely narrow. I had the highest metrics in my area and was a great resource to the team, but there was often tenure and politics involved in any promotion. Responsibilities are frequently increased in big increments but there wasn't nearly adequate financial compensation for the new responsibilities. After the loss of Steve Jobs, I believe the company shifted focus from the customer experience to generating higher numbers and impressing wall street. This became very evident in our budget cuts, resources and training that was provided, and severe reduction in headcount even during the busiest time of the year. Apple has also had a lot of success in convincing the public that its a green company; however, if you work just one day in the retail stores, you'll notice that Apple isn't really much of a green company at all. There is almost no recycling that occurs with the massive amounts of shipping and packaging for the products."}, {"review_title": "Fun, but somewhat frustrating.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Apr 2014", "job_title": "Tech Support", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary. Good benefits.  The opportunity to work with decent people.  Management, that (so far) is uniformly bright, and pretty easy to work for.  Easy going, (in some respects) corporate culture. It is like any job, though, follow the rules, and you will have no problems.  The problems start when you don't reach your assigned goals, and metrics.  The metrics for At Home Advisors are not overly strict, nor impossible to meet.  All you have to do is show up, do the job according to established practices ( and trust me, once you start doing that, it gets a whole lot easier, and your metrics are met......).  The company is fun to work for, you get gifts every quarter (nice Apple-branded clothing, high quality commuter cups, and water bottles.  Sometimes you get silly things as well, but that's just part of the fun of working there.)   The training for At Home Advisors is about 5 or 6 weeks long, and it is kind of tough. It's not impossible, but it's not easy either.  The overall atmosphere is fun, and it's fairly easy going as well.  Working from home also has the benefit of being away from office gossip, and office politics. In addition there is the employee purchase plan for Apple devices, and, all kinds of discounts on other stuff as well.   Apple builds their support around \"empathy\", and building a relationship with the customer, so they feel as if they are getting personal service from  you.  It's a good thing, too.  I have done tech support in the past, both face-to-face and over the phone.  Apples formula for doing things, while  hard to get used to for the cynical, is really an effective way of dealing with customers. There is also plenty of opportunity to advance, and move into a full time gig.  Also, your manager is their to support you.  All of the managers I have had, have been involved, encouraging, and supportive, but there is no \"hand holding\".  You are expected to take what you have learned, and help customers.  Now, don't mistake that as meaning you are on your own with no support.  Quite the opposite.  There is tons of support, but once something is given to you to do, you are expected to complete it, or accomplish it in the agreed upon way.  There are no excuses.  Your manager is there to support you, help you sharpen your skills, and give you some best practices.  All of my managers came up through Tech Support, going from Tier 1 to  Tier 2, and then moving in to Team Managers.  They have been there, they know how it works, and their knowledge is what will help you get to the next level.", "cons": "Constant Team Leader changes.  I am now on my 4th team manager in 18 months, all of them have been good so far, but, it does get a bit old  Hours and scheduling can be a bit crazy, you have to bid your shifts properly, so you get what you want.  One day per weekend is required, and that is your 8 hour day. You are generally kept at 20 hours a week.  If you take the benefits, (in my case it's for my entire family) anywhere from 25%-50% of your paycheck is gone.  Benefits, however, are good.   Customers... oh, the customers.... They can be draining..  Some of them are literally emotionally involved with their device.  I kid you not.  I have had customers crying because their Apple product is broken, and not working.  Many of the customer, in fact, the majority of them, are intelligent, and given to following instructions.

Also, pretty strong discounts on third party products from time to time. (like 40% off Bose, etc.) Also, additional $500 off after the 25% off Mac once every three years. So you can basically get an $1800 Mac for $850 once every three years. \r\n-Tuition Reimbursement (which may be getting enhanced to cover PT employees as well as FT)\r\n-Good hourly wage (plus overtime) in a retail environment.  New PT Specialists start at around $14 per hour, and you can be making $17-19 after 3-4 years if you get promoted to an Expert (sales leader) , or get promoted to Genius (technician) or Creative (Trainer).

As a FT employee, I had both of my days off during the week, and worked pretty much every Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Each store may be a little different, though, so ask if you are concerned.  Promotions are difficult.  Hard to get to where you want to go, and definitely no clear path to management.  Lots of politics and grudges held.  When I left, I was still being reminded of mistakes I had made 3 years ago.  Also, Leadership can tend to micromanage.  I suspect that this is different in each store.  Some customers are tough customers who have overly high expectations.  The hours are lousy, especially during the holidays.  Sometimes you might work 3pm-12am, even though the mall closes at 10pm. Expect 5x 9 hr. shifts during your week, with one hour unpaid lunch each shift and two paid 15 minute breaks each shift.  But don't expect to go to lunch on time, or to take your 15 minute breaks on time, because you probably won't.  Apple is in some hot water for this out in California.  You aren't paid commission, bonus, or anything, just hourly, so no matter how well you outperform everyone else, you get the same pay.

For example: An Apple Genius is the tech that troubleshoots and fixes your stuff at the Genius Bar.  An Apple Creative is the trainer that is very knowledgeable about software, who teaches you how to use your computer when you have a One-to-One membership.  They both get paid much more than Specialists (salespeople).  Apple invented the position \"Family Room Specialist\" to do a little of both of the Genius and Creative roles' jobs.  They have to train for it, bust their butts to prove themselves, interview, etc.  But after given the \"promotion\", they receive no pay increase.  Thus, Apple now doesn't have to hire any more higher-paid Genii or Creatives.\r\nAnother con?  Is the con.  They will (management) con you into believing that it's ok to be up front with them, and you can do anything...  This is true only if it makes that manager look good.

The technical knowledge is heavily relied on the consultant/contractor engineers.  The performance reviews can be conducted  arbitrarily and can be tweaked at the discretion of the manager.  It depends on the manager's integrity and honor if he/she will base your performance on merit.  Over time, the more you do project management work, the less you will do technical work unless you put in long hours at night.   The management team will do whatever possible to protect themselves and avoid all risk.  There is a lot of politics and arrogance.  One director hired most of her managers from her previous company.  Everyone who knew the director ascended to management ranks by this association.  So either it is by coincidence or maybe cronyism?  If you don't belong in that \"3com club\", then you will not be as richly compensated.  e.g. The managers brag to their employees about buying and/or rebuilding 1- 3 million dollar homes (ground up) in areas of Saratoga, Cupertino, and Evergreen.   \r\n\r\nJust to emphasize, this is for the Apple IS&T department.

I have seen times when a customer caused a scene because they couldn't return their two year old phone. As a result, the manager would give in and also give them a free phone case.

Many great employees were fired because of this broken policy.\r\n\r\nThey had system called the NPP where the customers can rate you. This was one of the reasons I left. Your raise is dependent on this. The store can be way understaffed and a customer can write a negative review about the experience ( not having control over it) so that effects your raise. Also, Management wants you to sell as much AppleCare or One to One as possible. You can convince a customer to buy it without being pushy at all. Then later on the customer will have buyers remorse and slam you by giving you a negative NPP score by saying \"they were too pushy\". Then I would be blamed by the managers for being too pushy and getting a detractor. If I didn't Applcare then they would ask me to please improve my numbers.

Whatever that means to you. To me it meant nothing.", "cons": "It is a high stress job involving travel to China. Since Apple products are assembled in China, thats where most of the action happens from a Supply Chain and Operations perspective. My days started early with calls with teams in Europe. During the day i was working with teams in US. From evening until night, I was on calls with teams in China as you get a lot of requests. It was a 24x7 thankless job. If you have time to manage two projects, you'll always have four. You are not innovating or designing cool products in Supply Chain. You are only making sure these products are ready when customers want it. The only differentiator in performance is the number of hours you put in. \r\n1. There are not many people with great backgrounds here. Most of the folks are from supply chain backgrounds from random less reputed companies or business schools for whom having Apple on the CV is a huge uplift. Some people with good background are at senior positions who joined Apple in the early days and they are enjoying their million dollar valuation of stocks.\r\n2. Leadership: Apple loves engineers. Most people in managerial roles got promoted from IC engineering roles and do not have an iota of aura or leadership qualities. They are very arrogant and don't care about people.\r\n3. The work is very stressful with aggressive targets and you have to always be on top of China. I have seen people break down in meetings. Many people had health issues and were always looking to exit. Having alcohol on your table is common. There is no time for personal life. When you join you are given a paper that says 'the work you will do is so great that people dont mind spending their weekends here'. Thats a hint. LOL\r\n4. Average employee turnover time is ten months. It is just not sustainable and that is why you can always find tons of open GSM roles on the Apple website. Apple is now a big organization and it is tough to move up and steer the politics.  \r\n5. Culture: There is no culture. Every person is on his/her own. There is no collaboration. No one likes to share anything and people keep fighting to prove their point. You'll be doing everything yourself from scratch everytime and that will add to the hours and frustration. In my team, people fought for air time and tried to make loud conversations with team mates when manager was around. It was fake environment. The director would come to happy hour in team area for two minutes and take a mental head count of who all were present and who all were not participating in this 'team event'.  \r\n6. Even with Apple salary, you'll just make your ends meet as this is one of the most expensive part of the world. You will never be able to afford to buy a house. You'll shell out all your money on rent and survival stuff. \r\n7. Career Opportunities: Depends on your relations. However every project is secretive and that limits your opportunities. Also, you can only move within your vertical. Moving to Applecare is not possible. Also, my manager dint help me in any way to find a new role when i wanted to change roles. Thats common. Also, you'll be hired because you can do the job well. Apple will not invest in your to develop new skills. You'll be doing the same work your entire life. \r\n\r\nIn short working at Apple involves high stress, all your hours, no new skills development and little savings. The only thing you get is an Apple name on your CV. Is it worth it? You decide for yourself. International folks with MBA, this role is a trap and its tough to get out.

Repeat the same stale processes or answer technical questions over and over. Customers come in thinking they can yell at you to get what they want. Or they think they know your job better. Management has nothing better to do than hover over their subordinates and nitpick/lord it over. Type A personalities that love to stick it to you if you do anything wrong in their eyes. You can't disagree from their collective opinions. You're being watched all the time. They espouse that \"we're all family\" and constantly repeat the desired belief in the cultish \"Apple values\" a la carte quotes every-major-company-ever uses to lure in its employees' brand loyalty. Pay is terrible considering it's a multi-billion dollar company. Zero work life balance. They'd rather you make them your #1 priority over school, family, and home.  Apple is a shady company exactly like everyone else. Just with more profit off the brainless public. If they have to repeatedly insist they are \"different\" and that \"they're family\" they're saying oxymorons. No upward movement.

I have never wished people harm before, until I spoke to some of the animals who were my customers in AppleCare.\r\n\r\n- Clueless management at all levels - from the senior Area Management downwards, most managers are clueless robots who are either external hires from other call centres or internally promoted clowns who were so bad at customer service they were able to brown-nose their way off the phones as quickly as possible. I wouldn't let them mind my cactus plant for 48 hours, let alone run a call centre. \r\n\r\n- Unsocial Hours - Forget weekends and Christmas / public holidays off if you are working in Tech Support or customer facing phone work. You will even be made to work Christmas day, because your life and your family are not important, some idiot who can't work out how to turn on his iPhone 7 at 9 am on 25th December is.

Same applies to weekends. \r\n\r\n- Endless micromanagement - all off-phone time is closely management.

The whole IS&T was built on top of it. A lot of the full time including many managers are coming from that background. Technical skill wise they can only offer the very basic and usually have no idea or insight when it comes to design and engineering. Mentally this brings them job insecurity and pushes them the urges to move to managerial role asap. \r\n\r\nProjects in this places usually have tight timelines to meet business needs so quality was never the main concern. In this place you will not learn anything new as you will be working with raw SQL and single methods with 2000+ lines of code embedded within static classes everywhere. Most of the internal business facing systems, if not all, were developed by contractors from various vendor companies. These contractors, as Apple grew, were converted into full time and some later became managers.\r\n\r\nDue to the large number of projects taking place in this org and the restriction on the rate of contractor conversion, sometimes outsiders will get hired in to run projects. Don't get me wrong, you are not really making any decisions here and if you are hired as a PM, you will be dealing with politics on a day to day basis. If you are hired as an engineer, you will not have any impacts at all because you are not allowed to code using the best practices. The technologies, methodologies and design patterns that you have learned are going to cause them fear of losing control and that is something they really do not want to see because they have no where else better to go. So they will try everything to stop and 'humiliate' you. After sometime you started to think, maybe this is not the right place and choose to move on. If you are NOT lucky enough to see the lucky ones move on, you will again see this bad cycle happening over and over again: Contractors getting converted, buddies of some higher up getting hired without following proper HR guidelines and occasionally some external hires (when they had no other options)\r\n\r\nIn IS&T you will see this quick people turnover quite often. It has the tendency of not able to keep the good people around. The ones left there mostly share the same kind of mentality. You will be wasting time if you think you could have it changed. The culture of this organization really isn't what represents the TRUE Apple. Hard work is not recognized, performance review won't make a difference if the BIG boss thinks about you differently. If you are skillful and young, join startup. If you can get an offer from anywhere else but IS&T from Apple, by all means go for it. The culture there will be completely different.

Maybe if you work with with their core business in hardware this may still be the company you think it is.\r\n\r\nIf you are anywhere in the administrative side all I can tell you is run away! They hire very incompetent upper management who create a horrible work culture. It takes you at least 30 days to schedule an appointment  with a psychiatrist in Austin and if you ask them why it's because they are full of the Apple employees who are trying not to lose their minds! Even the doctors on campus will admit that they can't believe the amount of employees who suffer chronic stress issues because of the work culture. \r\n\r\nMy advice is simple, if you have ambition and seek to grow in a successful career, run as far as you can from Apple. If you are a more relaxed person who only cares about getting a paycheck maybe you should consider it. \r\n\r\nThis is the type of place that makes you regret getting a promotion. Every time you go up the latter you are exposed to more and more incompetence until you want to throw your iMac out the window! \r\n\r\nThere is no respect for employees, no effort in providing what is needed for the job they ask you to do. Everyone is expected to deal with enormous amounts of ambiguity simply because they don't want to spend the money on clarifying anything. The internal tools are by far the worst I have had to use. Your hair will fall as the system crashes constantly and management refuses to spend the money on decent software. While I was an hourly employee we had to use a software to punch in and out except the tool would always break when you were trying to leave. It still baffles me how a company with as much money as Apple treats their employees as second class citizens compared to their customers.  \r\n\r\nI regret spending just under 4 years of my career in this madhouse. Bragging rights are not worth it! Keep your barista job along with your sanity.\r\n\r\nThey also discriminate with Texas employees and offer a crappy version of the healthcare they offer in California. California employees get a much better deal with Kaiser. Texas get crappy healthcare that will leave you owing hundreds every time you actually need to use it."}, {"review_title": "Project Manager", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working at Apple has been a great overall experience.
