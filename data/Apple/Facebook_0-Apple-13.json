If you're in college looking for a good part time gig to have some pocket money this is for you, if you're looking for a job(career) for more important reasons (supporting family - supporting yourself rent, groceries,general living) don't bother with a part time offer you will be stuck in a rut trying to advance. Work life balance is poor, especially if you're a part timer with open availability for all the hours you can scrounge. Metrics supposedly don't matter but in reality they do (surprise).
