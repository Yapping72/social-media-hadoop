As a tenured manager I saw a lot of changes over the years, some for the good, and some for the bad, but the biggest change has been a complete switching off of the focus on the customer and employee experience. This is mostly driven by senior management who are utterly obsessed with \u201cownership\u201d (aka sales), AppleCare and business introductions. This constant focus on driving numbers over the customer and employee experience has driven so many people out of the business. It doesn\u2019t matter how much money is made, and how nice the customer feedback for employees was, it was never enough. This was compounded in 2020 when Coaching at Apple was introduced, Apple\u2019s new management program, and managers became \u201ccoaches\u201d. This was a fancy title for what most people would call micro-managing, and it meant that talented and empathetic team members were \u201ccoached\u201d several times a day to sell AppleCare and get introductions for the business team, even those who didn\u2019t work on the shop floor.

An actor? A musician? Well, come on down to work at your local Apple Store!

They'll rope you in with the amazing healthcare, the 401k, the stock plan, and they'll even sweeten the deal by telling you that you can use your creative talents at work and get paid for it. If you'd like to direct movies then you'll perfect for selling MacBooks because you can talk to people about FinalCut Pro. If you're a musician then surely you know all kinds of stuff about Logic, so go sell more computers, you spineless selling machine! (By the way, did I mention that you will get zero commission for the thousands upon thousands of dollars you bring into this multi-trillion dollar company? That's right, no yucky competition with your fellow plebs, you'll be one big, happy family all working for the common goal of making Tim Cook dirty stinking rich while you slave away for just barely above minimum wage!) \r\n\r\nThen before you know it you've been working for Apple for five years, you've gotten your beloved PLAQUE and you have no idea how you'll survive in the wild because what other entry-level part-time gig will give you $19/hr? What other job can you get that will give you that sweet, sweet full coverage healthcare you've come to enjoy? Not to mention the stocks you'll lose if you quit now, so many of them have yet to vest and if you just wait one more year, two more years, threeeee moooooore yeeeears imagine the kind of money you'll have then!\r\n\r\nOh, and let's not forget about the Career Experiences! Apple will send a few lucky, lucky retail employees to go work up at corporate for six months curating playlists for Apple Music or fiddling alongside nerds with masters degrees on some really cool development job. And the entire time you'll be having a blast, taking pity on your coworkers still stuck at the retails store, while your new corporate managers are constantly dangling the promise of a promotion that will never come to go work permanently in Sunny Cupertino. They'll give you per diem, housing, and more money than you'll know what to do with! But then, your six month career experience will be over and you'll be shipped back to the retail store where you belong, you stinky salesperson. Turns out your theatre degree just wasn't good enough after all, so it's back to wiping boogers off of iPad screens. It's what you we're born to do. \r\n\r\nIf you are creative in any way and would like to not be sucked into Apple's ever-churning corporate machine, then you should stay as far away from their stores as possible.

If you dare call in sick they'll be borderline aggressive and it doesn't even matter if you haven't called in sick for a year. \n\n*A lot of concerns from the team get utterly disregarded. If a team member has some kind of complaint or anything along those lines they will certainly get pushed back. Sometimes that could also ruin their standing with the leadership. Managers change the topic or refuse to elaborate whenever there is any pushback.\n\n*At Apple, there is a huge conflict of interest between customer service and metrics. You can't have both. Perhaps this works better in the USA but certainly not in Australia. \n\n*For some reason, some team members get in trouble over virtually nothing, whilst others will not get sacked even if they consistently no-show.

I was there for 4 years, and during that time the job quickly turned from having genuine human interactions on the sales floor to \u201cwould you like fries with that\u201d interactions. It was no longer about listening to customers needs. They wanted us to be rattling off about services customers never mentioned or else our performance scores would go down. Got a 14 year old trying to buy a charging cable? Better mention the business team to him just in case this 14 year old is buying 20 computers a year for his business he might have. It was pretty ridiculous. \r\n\r\n2. Additionally, over time they kept moving product zone specialists to the tech specialist roles, but never hired on more product zone specialists. The job became very stressful as it felt as though there were never enough of us to help all of our customers. It was always very go-go-go, but it got a lot worse with time, as we lost more PZ specialists without replacing them. I remember running from one interaction to the next to try and get through the queue faster. \r\n\r\n3. Management was unchecked. Had managers who stole from the company for a long while before getting caught, others taking fraudulent leaves of absence, others being overtly and covertly racist to employees and/or customers. Took YEARS for a lot of these managers to get caught, because no one took our complaints seriously.
