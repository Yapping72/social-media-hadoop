I had an amazing time there with the staff, customers, and the innovative company culture.

Especially for new college graduates and entry-level staff. \r\n\r\nMany other companies regularly scout Apple employees as a resource for their own companies, management staff later, hence the `Golden Egg` moniker. Once you`ve been hired by Apple and have stayed there for over a year or so, then you can basically write your own ticket in terms of future career paths later in most cases because ex-Apple employees are always in high demand.\r\n\r\nThe salary for the positions is also pretty good and competitive in the job market.", "cons": "There aren`t really too many cons to working in this environment from my perspective, however, (depending on the area) I do feel that the majority of primary candidates for many of their roles would probably be people of a younger demographic who don`t necessarily have so many family responsibilities or children when starting out. \r\n\r\nApple is very much an equal opportunity employer in most cases and they do have their quotas for SDG compliance, but I believe that the company still more geared towards younger, single, and more flexible employees in terms of upper management positions, higher salaries, and promotions. \r\n\r\nIn a way, it kind of makes sense, because Apple is always looking for people with new, fresh ideas and a good level of communication skills/social interactions. On the other side though, depending on the area of employment, older staff or staff with more family obligations may find their options for promotion or getting a salary increase based on longer service years at the company a bit more competitive than in other places."}, {"review_title": "Just", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good good good good good", "cons": "none none none none none"}, {"review_title": "Technical and Friendly", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great engineering environment with a lot of interesting problems to solve.
