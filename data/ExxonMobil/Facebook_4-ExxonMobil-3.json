An old technology. They are scared that someone will steal technology that they don\u2019t have. It is like a military and even worse. Very sensitive people.  I dont understand is why people stay.

Working to near-death is the norm, and anything below that is considered poor performance, despite what anyone will tell you. Physical/emotional/mental health issues are pervasive and common among co-workers (which they will keep secret so it will not be used against them). \r\n-95% of the meetings you will have here (in your entire career) are a complete waste of time, and will consider ridiculous questions and considerations with hair-splitting levels of detail, (the ones from my experience) tend to be poorly planned and facilitated, leading to what was supposed to be a one hour meeting turning into a 2 hour lecture of the biggest windbags thinking out loud to everyone with no consensus or resolution...Until two or three more iterations of these meetings take place. Because there are so many of these meetings, work can never get done-this is one of the main reasons why the work/life balance is poor. Spend the morning & afternoon surviving meetings, spend the nights catching up with work, repeat until inevitable burnout. Just remember: everyone likes the sound of their own voice here, plan accordingly...and bring aspirin.    \r\n- Other co-workers are extremely incompetent and make work a nightmare in comparison-if you have a whiff of capability on you they will snuff it out with their toxic personalities and their ability to jockey you around on wild goose chases by off-loading their work onto you with minimal guidance-and taking all the credit for anything that looks good, of course.\r\n- Your relationship with your manager is everything, ESPECIALLY at the beginning. If your personalities conflict in any way-if he/she likes chocolate and you like vanilla-it will be used against you. It gets really nauseating seeing the great lengths some would take to get in with their manager-especially during ranking season...aspirin will not be enough...\r\n- A lot of backstabbing/boot-licking/one-upping/unethical practices among peers, all in the name of ranking, your colleagues are not family, but competition to keep a watchful eye on...trust no one.\r\n- New hires are treated like idiots with next to no capability (common phrase: \"All the new hires know is where the coffee is...\"), if you are one of them, you cannot have an opinion, in order to have one you will have to be hyper-aggressive and out-shout your co-workers rather than collaborate with them, or wait a few extremely bitter years where competency is measured by something as arbitrary as the number of years had with the company. When that kicks in, then take those years of frustration out on the new hires under you to perpetuate this stupid practice. A lot of lip service about being inclusive and empowered (\"influence without authority\" remains to be a hilariously hypocritical motto commonly used), but none of this is in practice-only the opposite: keep your head down, shut up and take your beatings, and work overnight because I said so. Meanwhile, experienced hires have issues with being pigeonholed into a position and being trapped there until retirement (OR they are rotated at a very slow rate relative to their peers who are or were new-hires)-basically taking away one of the main reasons for working here (frequent job rotations).\r\n- Rotations are great, but they are very rarely planned well (most do not ever happen, yet are mentioned as if they will, and the ones that do give you too little time to prepare) - also be ready to accept something that you do not want nor did you ask for, in a location you were not too thrilled about. YOU CANNOT SAY NO, it's an option...but it isn't.\r\n-Ranking is a taboo subject for a reason: it is an insidious process in that the ones who can influence/change/remove it are those who benefited the most from it, so it will never be influenced/changed/removed. It's typical that incompetent brown-nosers are rewarded in the top third, those who keep the lights on are in the middle third, and the bottom third are those who are being punished for political reasons (looked at the wrong person the wrong way), or cared too much about \"silly\" things such as the \"life\" part in a work/life balance.\r\n-Personal perspective, but I feel like this company was designed for only one type of person in mind, and those who happen to deviate in one or many ways from this mold will have significant challenges to face working here. If you're sensitive, an introvert, are polite, are secure in yourself and feel no need to compete with others viciously, are empathetic, have a sense of humor (and not afraid to show it), are prone to anxiety/depression, are modest, are informal, etc. you will be fighting yourself in the name of your career, you will need to compromise your identity, and the wonderful things that make you-well-you, and fit the aforementioned mold if you want to make it here...A fate worse than death if you ask me: a walking corpse. \r\n- Youngsters are typically looking elsewhere to springboard after a few years here, and the Old Folks are basically counting their days until retirement...not a good sign.\r\n-From personal experience, the campus-despite being very pretty and full of amenities-is basically a very uptight and pretentious country club, dress code is strict, personnel is tight-lipped and formal, and the conversations you will have with peers are abysmally shallow (on purpose of course, the walls have ears). While the sites have some of these tight-lipped and formal folks, the atmosphere is more intense yet loose with everyone fighting their own respective fire (each site is very different, some better than others, so hope you're in one of the \"good\" ones if it applies) so it becomes as informal as the dress code there as everyone is essentially in the trenches together-these different worlds clash often when they have to work together, just another frustration to add to the laundry list. \r\n-There are so many contractors here, doing essentially most of the hard work...It makes you wonder if management trusts the competency of their own employees...  \r\n-Bad managerial decisions are made frequently, sadly the excrement flows downstream to the poor saps who will clean up the mess hoping it would reflect well in their rankings.\r\n-Generalized comment, but a very common one among myself and those who I have had candid conversations with: there is NO TRUST in anyone, none. Micromanagement is the norm here (find a study where that is NOT a terrible management style) regardless of your level of competence. Coupled with this micromanagement, everything has a checklist to go through, a process to follow, a list of people who have to approve unanimously, no decision is solely yours, but the decision of a committee on your behalf. Nothing is done by you, just pending approval from others. And you cannot circumvent or skip these process without going through an even more cumbersome process to skip the aforementioned process. The bureaucracy is beyond perplexing, and the fact that people have memorized and defend this is even more perplexing. It's weird how what was an initiative to idiot-proof everything has only lead to an inefficient weapon used by idiots to punish those who think outside of the box...it's a work of art, honestly. While there are new initiatives developed to cut down on this red tape, they are still using their cumbersome and mind-boggling processes to develop this process to cut down on their processes like some kind of Ouroboros...again, ART!\r\n-High attrition rate from the 5-year mark onwards due to these aforementioned cons, who wants 5-35 years of this kind of abuse? At this rate you would not survive long enough for retirement."}, {"review_title": "OK, but not the industry leader they think they are", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "30 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Process Technician in Baytown, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits\r\nJob security\r\nSchedule consistency\r\nOvertime available\r\nGood meals", "cons": "Poor management\r\nTerrible maintenance\r\nDon\u2019t follow their own rules\r\nRules for rules"}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Mar 2021", "job_title": "First Line Supervisor in Baton Rouge, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and pay salary", "cons": "Not good for moral and ranking system sucks"}, {"review_title": "Good Place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Network Analyst in Kuala Lumpur", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Healthy Culture, Opportunities to work in any field", "cons": "I dont personally like agile framework"}, {"review_title": "Unethical", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Wells Engineer in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great salary competitive with the industry", "cons": "Culture is toxic and company is unethical"}, {"review_title": "ExxonMobil Thailand Overview", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Nov 2020", "job_title": "API Technical Consultant in Bangkok", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- international company\r\n- competitive salary\r\n- good benefit (master degree scholarship, house loaning funding)\r\n- good environment/ good colleagues", "cons": "- late night meeting\r\n- salary increase is relative to others"}, {"review_title": "Loved working there", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Clerical & Administrative in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours, good pay, Nice supervisor, many benefits.", "cons": "It was 37 miles away from my house."}, {"review_title": "Life At ExxMobil", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Cost Engineer in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Competent colleagues\r\nClear career progression\r\nDiversity of roles\r\nPass", "cons": "Slow to adapt\r\nLimited focus on work-life balance"}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Project Manager in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Teams and supporting employees", "cons": "Recent Layoffs aren't great, morale is down."}], [{"review_title": "Descending dynamic", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Business Analyst in Notre-Dame-de-Gravenchon", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Good avantages & salary\r\n- Integrated on site activities : a complete experience\r\n- Internationnal group", "cons": "- Lack of dynamism, lot of administrative dimensions\r\n- HR competition \r\n- Far away affiliate vs US headquarters, closings .."}, {"review_title": "Amazing workplace", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Scrum Master in Budapest", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexibility in working hours\r\nGreat colleagues\r\nInteresting/challenging projects\r\nAmazing work/life balance", "cons": "Salaries are average compared to other BSCs"}, {"review_title": "Great Place to Work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Senior Project Manager in Baton Rouge, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High salaries\r\nAdvanced training available\r\nGlobal opportunities", "cons": "Unstable economic conditions\r\nCurrently downsizing project managers"}, {"review_title": "Pump Operator", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Pump Operator in Anderson, SC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good pay and nice staff", "cons": "long hours but still not bad"}, {"review_title": "ExxonMobil Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "3 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Operations Engineer in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people.

Honestly, don't be deceived by the 7% 401k match, pension, and talks about career opportunities. There are plenty of companies out there that offer competitive base salaries, 401k match and equity. If you want to maintain your sanity, STAY AWAY! Ha! \r\n\r\n1.\tRanking system - ExxonMobil evaluates employees on a relative basis. This means you are compared to your peers. You will be put on a rank list with other employees in your department (sometimes EVEN YOUR SUPERVISOR!). Your performance will be ranked relative to your peers and sometimes supervisor(depending on your work group). Sometimes it does not matter if your absolute performance has been stellar all year. You could receive stellar feedback all year and still be told that you did not perform well \"relative\" to your peers. Supervisors love this because anyone with a personal Vendidad can easily hide under the \u201crelative\u201d system. Oh, you did great but \u201crelative\u201d to your peers, you weren\u2019t competitive. The implications of this is that you could end up in what the company calls \"MLRP\" program, which stands for Management of Lower Relative Performance. Usually employees that end up in the bottom of the list are put in the MLRP program and will be given options to resign and receive 2-4 months pay (depending on your role and how well the company is doing), retire (if you have obtained at least 15 years of service and age 55), or take a performance improvement plant (which most people don't stand a chance of passing).\r\n2.\tLayoffs \u2013 do not be deceived by the talks about ExxonMobil not doing layoffs. That is a LIE! The company does do layoffs and hides under \u201crelative performance ranking.\u201d For instance, during 2020 covid when the energy sector was struggling, the company made a decision to force rank 8- 10% of its population in the MLRP program. This was a clear calculated move to reduce its workforce under the umbrella of \u201cperformance management.\u201d New hires were not even given all the options of the MLRP program. They were told to resign. What\u2019s messed up is that a couple of months before that happened, management was bragging to new hires about how new hires would not be ranked in this system for 2 years. And then all of a sudden, covid hit, the company did poorly and could no longer maintain its workforce. But because they have made so much noise to shareholders and the public about not doing layoffs, they had to maintain that image and hide under \u201crelative performance\u201d ranking. The company is a cancer, complete and utter joke. \r\n3.\tFrequent Job Changes with minimal training & unreasonable expectations \u2013 ExxonMobil will sell you the dream that you will have plenty of opportunities to undertake different roles within your time with the company, which is true. However, note that the company does a POOR job at transitioning employees into different roles and providing training. You are essentially given opportunities with little to no training and expected to do exceptionally well. \r\n4.\tSystematic racism \u2013 most times minorities and females are the ones who end up in the bottom of the rank list.

The culture is toxic.  Although, this is highly dependent on where you work as the culture of each site/office can vary widely.  The low moral is everywhere - from entry level to managers.  Nearly everyone is either openly bitter or discontent.  People stay primarily to receive a paycheck in order to pay their bills.  Very few workers are actually happy to be there and come to work because they enjoy it.  Negativity is quite pervasive.  I can literally count on one hand how many times I've heard someone make positive comments in all my years here.  On the other hand, I can fill a book with the number of negative comments.\r\n\r\nVery high attrition rate.  Younger folks are leaving all the time.  Those who have been around longer seem to be imprisoned with golden handcuffs, and are literally waiting around to hit that magic age when they can finally retire and collect their pension.  Management seems to care less that people are constantly leaving before their prime.\r\n\r\nClandestine ranking system.  Highly subjective and not a true meritocracy as it\u2019s very dependent on what managers \"think\" about you and not so much on actual work output.  Perception is everything.  If you\u2019re not willing to pucker-up your lips and schmooze, or you don\u2019t get along with your manager, you can kiss your career good-bye.\r\n\r\nPay is good for new hires and drops off sharply thereafter.  The pay eventually plateaus unless you are continuously promoted.  No bonus of any kind of profit sharing unless you are a higher level manager.  \r\n\r\nLack of accountability or expectations.  People are rarely held accountable for their actions \u2013 especially managers.  Roles and responsibilities are written down, but not consistently followed or enforced.  Positions are literally reinvented as new people rotate into them.  \r\n\r\nPoor management.  Too many new managers who have no idea how to manage, and older managers who would rather be individual contributors, or simply don\u2019t care anymore and are just waiting to retire.  The good managers are few and far in-between.  Unfortunately, they tend to rotate away and never comeback.  Management provides little vision or direction.  Most of them are just checking the box and trying to survive to their next rotation.  Managers keep implementing new initiatives and reorganizations when they are absolutely clueless as to their chances for success.  There is no acknowledgement as to why past initiatives failed and why these new ones will work.  The managers like to point fingers and rarely take ownership and blame for their shortcomings.  Heaven forbid it\u2019s ever management\u2019s fault for something as that would damage their careers, which seems to be their only concern.  There is a so much rotational movement in management that there is an endless cycle of initiatives, agendas, and policies.    \r\n\r\nRefining business has been tough since the economic downturn.  ExxonMobil treats production sites and the workers there like a commodity that can be bought or sold at anytime.  Unless you\u2019re a high level manager, you will be sold to the highest bidder at the right price.\r\n\r\nLazy workforce that is extremely contractor dependent.  The contractors tend to do most of the real work.\r\n\r\nTons of procedures and guidelines on almost everything.  The problem is, not everyone follows them or even know they exist.  As a result, the vast majority of guidelines and procedures are not accurately followed and simply ignored.\r\n \r\nVery little training.  All the training is focused on safety and you are rarely trained on actually how to do your job.  Only operations/maintenance workers tend to have some type of set training plan.  Otherwise, it\u2019s a free for all and you are left on your own to figure out how to do your job if your manager isn\u2019t proactive in developing you.\r\n\r\nSafety culture is a bit too strong, even in comparison to other ExxonMobil sites.  All everyone talks about is safety and its been taken to an almost painful extreme.  Everyone is forced to do field observations each month.  Most people think its a joke exercise - something forced upon them by management.  Very few people actually believe in it, but its taboo to say that openly."}, {"review_title": "World-class organization that provides rewarding work experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "31 Dec 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Challenging work, excellent compensation, high-cailber coworkers, proven track record of performance, many employee development opportunities, global business provides opportunity to work with diverse cultures. strong senior leadership", "cons": "High level of structure, need to be comfortable in such an environment; do not celebrate success often but rather continuously focuses on the next problem"}, {"review_title": "Good company, bad location", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "1 Jan 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay and personal development.

You will have two choices: get a room along with other random people (kinda like college), or get a very very small apartment on the outskirts of Prague (btw once you leave the two blocks center of Prague the city turns into a soviet wasteland made of popular housing grey buildings: tagging along with neighbours and store clerks that do not speak a word of English). \n\nProgression \nCareer progression is a dead slow bureaucratic process that is gonna lead you to a capped salary raise at less than 5% of your monthly earnings. So get ready to settle in with your Czech roommates (btw most roommates will require you to pay extra for guests that stay 3+ days in your room - something to do with amortising the furniture and floor, or just them not getting laid). \n\nBenefits\nRecruiters, and line managers love to talk you about the great company benefits, but I believe that\u2019s is just to convince themselves that they are actually not that bad. \nThey are. Discounts are low (5-10%), gym is subpar (not actually a gym just cardio), massages and health benefits are available just twice a month. Language classes for Russian or Croatian are a joke (you actually need to be relatively conformable speaking either one to qualify - prior to admission you got to take a test). \n\n\nCulture\nWell, if you are still reading I will let you know that I saved the best for last. Since day one of your new job at ExxonMobil you will be reminded at least 20 times a day about safety - of you see a puddle on the floor report it, if you see someone opening a door to quickly let them know, if someone walks too quickly in the hallway let them know it is not safe, and so on. You will have realised this is just an interesting take on corporate bs; only thing special is that most of the employees will actually believe what they are telling you is smart (and not something you could have realised with the common sense of a 5yo). This should give you an idea on the type of people you will actually be working with. \n\n\nThese leads me to the most important part of the review. The company treats this local office as a business support center (as the name states) a.k.a. a glorified callcenter. The people you will be working with and the career you will have here are the same you should expect if you were working in an actual call center. There is absolutely no connection in terms of career opportunities with the American headquarter, so if you applied to this job with the intention of climbing ExxonMobil corporate ladder give up and run away as fast as you can."}], [{"review_title": "Good place to make money, not a fun place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "12 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Mid Career Employee in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stable job.

If it can work out in a convenient fashion, go ahead, but don't skip work or engage in hours of preparation for your interview.  It's not worth it. Here's why:\r\n- Upper management requires a certain quota of interviews be conducted before they close out a job opening.  So hiring managers will continue to contact and set up interviews well after the chosen candidate has taken the job.  You might be putting yourself through a lot in preparation for your \"opportunity\".  To them, you're just a box for them to put a checkmark in.\r\n- They conduct both the internal and external hiring phases AT THE SAME TIME.  Given that they will select the internal candidate 100% of the time, it makes absolutely no sense to open up the job listing to the public until the internal search has been exhausted.  But again, these people do not care about the time and effort you put into your end of the interview process.  If they did they would stagger the two job posting phases.\r\n- During your interview they may read off some pre-composed wording about how long the candidate selection process will last, and when you will hear back from them with a response (usually they'll say one or two weeks).  They are lying.  If you don't get the job, they will not contact you, and you'll just eventually have to figure it out for yourself two to four weeks down the road.  Again, you may put time, energy and even sacrifice a few things in order to interview with them at their designated time, and they cannot be bothered with the 0.00001 seconds to send an automated email letting you know they've decided to go in another direction. \r\n\r\nThis process of \"interviewing in bad faith\" is common in some other industries, like finance.  Fortunately, Exxon is the only company in the Oil&Gas/Energy sector that does this, as most companies recognize it as being needlessly cruel by playing with other peoples' hopes.  If you have an interview with them coming up, congratulations.  You may indeed get hired.  Or you may simply be an unwitting accomplice in the hiring manager's attempt at meeting his quota, and a job offer was never on the table in the first place.  \r\nI'm just saying, don't get your hopes up with this company."}, {"review_title": "Excellent company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Logistics Advisor in Spring, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people, great benefits, great culture, development opportunities, grow, inspired, learn, I've been working here for the last three years.
