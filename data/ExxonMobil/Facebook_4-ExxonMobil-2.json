There is a DB pension plan in addition to a 401k match (assuming they bring it back). Paid maternity leave along with temporary disability. There is unrivaled growth potential, especially if you take initiative and demonstrate you are able to save the company money. They try to accommodate your career interests with open job opportunities. The Spring campus is beautiful and has a state-of-the-art gym, on site dentist, optometrist, food court, and other shops. Additionally, management tries to be flexible on days you have other personal commitments. I never had to worry about leaving early or working from home if I had a doctor's appointment, home delivery, etc.", "cons": "They infamously suspended the 401k match at the peak of the coronavirus. It is made abundantly clear that working from home long-term is out of the question unless you have a job assignment that warrants it (e.g auditor) because they want you to utilize the campus and collaborate in-person. Upper management is extremely far-removed from the day-to-day tasks and issues, partially due to the fact that Exxon is such a huge company, but this can be a problem for recurring issues that to them might be minute, but to the average worker cause a lot of frustration and angst."}, {"review_title": "work at exxon", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "20 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Big Data Engineer in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "money is great and the people too", "cons": "not a lot of free time for my family"}, {"review_title": "High compensation for mediocre work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Engineer in Baytown, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High pay, pretty good package, pension and previously 401k match. \n\nWork schedule flexibility depending on function.

The hits keep coming with the announcement of more workforce reductions in the coming years. \r\n\r\nWorkforce attrition has ramped up significantly for the reasons above. \r\n\r\nThere exists a hierarchy of two career paths for MPTs ... one is a technical career path and the other is management. While that sounds unique and inspiring, it is not. EM recruits college graduates with the allure of the \u201cManagement or MD\u201d path and absolutely runs over the individuals on the technical career path to balance the personnel distributions on the assessment lists. The intellectual schizophrenia on display by management when wondering why individuals do not want to chose a technical career path is a marvel to behold. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of assessments, this \u201cnew\u201d assessment system is completely demotivating for 80% of the workforce. All individuals are on one year employment contracts with the new assessment system. It is possible for a person to fall from Outstanding with Distinction to NSI within one cycle (although unlikely). For additional demotivating facts, unless you are assessed with a CL 38 potential early on in your career, do not bother putting in extra time. Stated differently, only put in enough time to not get NSI\u2019d until you can get your next gig lined up. The company does a disservice to MPT new hires by not discussing the probabilities of attaining a certain level of success. For example, there exist about a 20% chance of making it to CL28 or higher. There exist about a 4% chance of making it to CL30 or higher. Since humans have a tendency to select the path of least resistance, the question for an early career engineer becomes \u201cDo I try to achieve position / status / pick your poison against the odds?\u201d Casinos attract gamblers in much the same manner that EM convinces engineers that they too can become an executive.

More of lectures and mundane speakers. Leaders keep boosting about we are best, and we want best, spread empathy, collaboration etc.., these are nice to hear words but zero action. \r\n\u2022\tNew performance system is such a stupid idea where every individual should have all type of working expertise whether- quality, project execution, estimation, construction, procurement etc. There is hardly any focus on functional expertise, jack of all trades- again a misleading career path- hopeless system, this idea contradicts to the definition of \u201cOrganization\u201d or \u201cOrganized workforce.\u201d \r\n\u2022\tSupervisors does not even know how to handle work and manage resources.\r\n\u2022\tIndividuals must search for work and literally fight for budgets with different affiliates across world.\r\n\u2022\tThe other affiliates in fear of losing their own job/ work- humiliate other individuals / Indian affiliates.\r\n\u2022\tLack of trust among employees as there is sense of fear of losing job.\r\n\u2022\tBiggest joke here is-even accountants or finance background person are designated as engineer.

There is behavior propaganda every now and then, believe in me if you are true and honest with your work be ready to pack your bag, people will try to push you out.

My question is- who will understand the contract unless an individual knows proper international language.\r\n\u2022\tNew experienced are hired with pre-plan understanding that individual will be forced to leave after 1-2 years of time just to showcase that there is an attrition rate. Such is the thought process of one of the biggest organizations, hopeless mindset.\r\n\u2022\tThere is helm of collusion among few of the employees, and the new employee is judged every now and then.\r\n\u2022\tThe organization in India runs in a fashion which seems to be a college or some school type of environment, with less of professional maturity.\r\n\u2022\tMy suggestion is if any individual is having his/ her job in multinational company just do not leave that since you got an offer from brand name EM as thought, this organization only believe people will join if we throw them offer and think everyone is replaceable. Join Exxon Mobil only as last option and be prepared to search a new one ASAP, since your real performance does not matter here. People will blabber performance based, but it is all perception and politics (personal touch) basis, rest all is gimmick. Be careful with Singapore counterpart, EM Singapore are the most frustrated team on earth, with lack of proper project processes and management skill sets, people are just warming their seats and fooling around.\r\n\u2022\tOne more nonsense thing is the employee must depend on supervisor for understanding or support whether functional, admin, travel, HR, performance, etc.\u2026and if an individual is not satisfied with answers from supervisor you cannot approach anyone. For example: If there is HR related matter and supervisor does not know, if you approach HR, HR will say contact supervisor. Such a frustrating workflow. So, if there is any problem with supervisor you cannot contact anyone, it is a total dead end.\r\n\u2022\tLastly in the name of confidentiality this organization will do all amoral and unethical -behavior and action with an individual just to prove their point."}, {"review_title": "Outsourcing Jobs", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "19 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Project Manager in Spring, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great when its great - still competitive salary", "cons": "Outsourcing a lot of jobs which other companies learned their lessons already.

The infamous forced ranking at ExxonMobil will never get enough criticism. If you're on a technical track, prepare to be the pedestal for everyone in the management track to step over you. You can Google the ExxonMobil layoff forum and read some of the sentiments that people share. I certainly relate to them a lot. Too much to explain here.\r\n\r\n- Complete lack of empathy, transparency, and most importantly truth from senior (and many times junior) management. They're very good at speaking fluff language given to them by expensive management consultants.\r\n\r\n- The epitome of corporate America and capitalism. Complete disregard to the communities in which we do work as well as our employees. We will do whatever it takes to get the biggest piece of the pie. I recommend you read on our involvement with Guyana and how our top 4 executives gave themselves a nice bonus the day they laid off thousands in Dec 2020.\r\n\r\n- No logical long-term or short-term strategy. Basically doubling down on what we've been doing this whole time.\r\n\r\n- Spending money on algae because it looks good in ads (but it really doesn't because everyone knows we're greenwashing).\r\n\r\n- Still speaking like we're the best in the industry and that we hire the best. This is self-explanatory. This was the world's largest corporation just in 2013...while Tesla's market cap was barely $5B....enough said.\r\n\r\n- Being in denial about the paradigm shift happening in the energy industry and the world as a whole.\r\n\r\n- Being super top heavy and operating like the Soviet Union, instilling fear into the common folk. Anyone who dares to speak up will be PIPed, especially in the new ranking system that took away the threshold of how much you can drop in one assessment cycle.\r\n\r\n- Taking way too long to properly respond to COVID, particularly internally.

If you do not like working from home and do not like carrying laptop to home. \r\n6. If you like wearing business formals 4 days a week.\r\n7. If you like to bring your own lunch or willing to order food from outside as there is no proper lunch cafeteria in office. Small pantries just provides tea coffee as usual.", "cons": "1. Poor treatment of employee by forcing them to resign over the call during the probation soon after the lockdown restrictions were lifted, immediately employee was threatened for termination if not resigning voluntarily. \r\n2. Employees have switched over to this organisation during Covid thinking it is the most stable and reliable organisation in these difficult times but soon the employees realise the mistake was realised when employee have to go through the entire horrible and humiliating experience.\r\n3. Group harassment and politics during the meetings with no respect to employees and making derogatorily and threatening remarks to the employee over the call telling \u201cGovt. restrictions are in place during the lockdown so we can not fire you currently\u201d.\r\n4. No Job Security during Covid and the organization did not provided support to the employees that always put emphasis on adopting safety and security culture and specially during these difficult Covid crisis times that became the top priority while on the other hand, the management was unable to ship the laptop when the helpless employee was stuck at home due to the sudden lockdown Govt. announcement soon after joining the organisation and instead of providing the equal employment opportunity and the necessary support, the management took advantage of the situation and employee was threatened for forced resignation otherwise face termination.\r\n5. Probation period was a joke with no clarity, it was first extended and then reverted to original date without any prior notice then suddenly PIP was introduced as a tool without following a proper process a month before the probation ends to prove to HR which was misused by the management in the process of terminating the employee.\r\n6. Roles and Responsibilities or Duties letter for the assigned designated role was not issued by the management even after escalating to HR multiple times and every organisation provides that letter which is an important document needed by employees to apply for higher studies or work permit for abroad in the future and it is legal right of the employee to receive letter.\r\n7. The pain of the employee doesn\u2019t end here. After exit, Full and Final settlement was not addressed properly and the leave days amount was deducted as the helpless employee was stuck at home and took unexpected leaves during the lockdown also internet bill amount was not reimbursed working from home. Management took advantage of the Covid lockdown situation and has not reimbursed the leaves in spite of notice issued by the Govt. to pay full salary to employees during the lockdown.\r\n8. Inexperience, Immature, Rude behaviour of management and HRs who doesn\u2019t have the proper skills and expertise thereby creating the hostile work environment for the employees and keep bullying the employees.\r\n9. Management takes on average 3-4 months to onboard the new employees by performing the strong background verification and medical checks but did not think even twice before when it comes to firing the employees without giving them any prior notice in spite of going through the lengthy hiring process.\r\n10. Employees are terminated straightway when laptop gets lost, misuse of corp card and clicking on phishing emails thrice.\r\n11. Management is above HR and there is no mediator so supervisor decides everything for the employee and takes advantage of the system. If anything needs to be escalated then no one listens to the employee as HR is helpless and always supports only to management who have been given all the power and authority which they misuse on the employee and also restrains them in raising any valid concerns to the senior management.\r\n12. Boring organisation with outdated processes, tech geeks soon forgets their coding skills but will at least learn few politics, advanced excel and ppt skills. Nowadays where all the organizations are moving towards Big Data/AI/ML/IOT/Blockchain etc. while this one still runs on old technologies and the system refuses to get updated.\r\n13. There is no proper hierarchy process, team members who hired the person at the same level becomes their team manager itself that shows the gaps in the management promotion policies and some times manager\u2019s experience is at the same level as that of team members which creates a lot of ego issues within in the team.\r\n14. Outdated bell curve appraisal process, employees on the same designation are rated relatively to each other by making it a cat race and during recruitment process HR doesn\u2019t negotiate the CTC and directly reject the offer.\r\n15. Bossy, Military, Authoritative and commanding culture. No respect for employees, Managers continue to interfere in your work and micromanagement can be seen everywhere.\r\n16. Suffocating Strict Military Safety Rules - Carrying laptop to home is not allowed, laptop needs to be locked in a locker before leaving office, laptop bag is not allowed to be placed near to the desk and too be locked too, walking while talking over the mobile phone is not allowed, restroom door need to be knocked before entering, coffee cup lid should be closed while carrying coffee from pantry to desk, Stair case railings should be hold tightly while climbing up or down the stairs, follow ergonomics seating position is continuously monitored, stretch out every 2 hours away from desk when music gets played. If any of these above things are not followed strictly then the incident gets reported against the employee for not following safety guidelines which in turn affects the appraisal and employment.\r\n17. Strictly no work from Home allowed. Mostly it\u2019s UK shift (2-11 pm) working hours so employee end up reaching home by midnight having no work life balance and no flexibility or relaxation timings with 9 hours compulsory swipe in and swipe out, Login by 2pm strictly and the timings are continuously monitored otherwise it has an impact on the employment.\r\n18. Private browsing is not allowed. Gmail/LinkedIn/Facebook/YouTube/Quora/Coursera etc. all other 3rd party sites are banned, justification needs to be provided for opening any websites other than work-related and web-traffic is monitored continuously that has an impact on employment.\r\n19. Formal Dress code Mon-Thurs and business casuals only on Friday. Incident gets reported if any employee is not found in proper attires and warning gets issued.\r\n20. No cafeteria in office apart from tea and coffee and Tech park cafeteria is also pathetic with limited food options that makes the employees to reliant on bringing their own food or order it from outside.\r\n21. Incorrect filling the project timesheet affects the appraisal and its a headache old, sluggish process for getting approvals for anything.\r\n22. Even after getting B1/B2 visa by any luck, the probability of travelling to US gets deferred by management by making silly excuses like budget issues and with the current Covid situation, forget about the chances of even B1/B2 being initiated.\r\n\r\nNever join this organisation if \u2013\r\n1. If you don\u2019t like to be in risky probation period of first 6 months where you can be terminated anytime without any prior notice as the also mentioned in the offer letter when you sign and submit.\r\n2. Do not join this organisation thinking its a Brand name or Fortune top 10 symbol and never fell into the Fat CTC offering trap, soon you will regret the decision to join later and by the time you realise it would be too late to recover. It\u2019s all about showing that glossy picture from outside and display those golden Safety and Security values to the employees thousand times but no one really cares when the employees are threatened to get terminated specially during this Covid times. It is better to be in a small and stable Non-Fortune 500 organisation rather than joining this giant unstable organisation where there is no job security where employees are terminated anytime without any reason or prior notice.\r\n3. If you are scared of getting PIP during the probation period and fear the chances of getting fired by facing the humiliating experience.\r\n4. If you are a technical geek and hoping to exposure to latest technologies like Big data/AI/ML/Cloud/IOT/Blockchain etc. and if you do not like Oil and Gas domain.\r\n5. If you would like to be respected at the workplace and doesn\u2019t like working under authoritative or commanding culture of inexperienced, Immature management who are experts in in micromanagement and harassing the employees all the time.\r\n6. If you care about Roles and Responsibilities letter to be generated for your designated position after you leave the organisation as unlike other organisations this letter which is important to apply for future studies or work visa abroad will not be provided by this organisation. \r\n7. If you like working in a flexible open environment where you have the freedom to work from home and no swipe in swipe outs and flexible timings.\r\n8. If you like working in a general shift and find comfort in casuals not Business formals.\r\n9. If you feel suffocated to follow the safety rules as mentioned above. \r\n10. If you wouldn\u2019t like to be waiting for months of joining date after going through rigorous hiring process of background and medical checks.\r\n11. If you are a family person having kids at home as the workplace is not at all employee friendly with neither work from home nor flexible working hours and mostly it is UK shift timings.\r\n12. If you like to browse 3rd party sites or social media sites frequently in your laptop during office hours which are blocked here, are continuously monitored and can affect the employment."}],
