Seagate recently acquired the Flash Components Division of Avago Technologies, which previously acquired LSi, which previously acquired Sandforce. Many of the original Sandforce folks worked really hard to realize a technology and were still vesting a significant amount of the startup equity and mostly this vesting would have completed by late 2015. This equity had been maintained through the acquisition by LSI and Avago. Unfortunately Seagate chose not to recognize existing vesting schedules and came up with a retention scheme that basically screwed the longstanding creators of the technology. A gun was held to our heads in taking the deal to leave Avago and sign up with Seagate in which Avago threatened to withhold bonuses that would have been paid. Avago is basically a technology corporate raider that acquires companies and sells of pieces as it sees fit. \r\n\r\nThis has now lead to a very negative work environment in which the main topic of discussion is how badly treated people were and what other opportunities are available outside of Seagate. A number of people have already left, and It seems like the team is on the verge of complete disintegration, and Seagate will have purchased technology assets that are worthless without the creators of the technology. This seems so stupid as $450m was paid for the acquisition and the amount that engineers were screwed out of was probably in the $10m range. \r\n\r\nI think it is already too late to save the Sandforce team, so posting this here for others that may end up in a similar situation.

This led to some excitement, but mostly uncertainty.\r\n\r\n-The benefits, particularly the health insurance, were a joke compared to what we had and it forced every employee, regardless of health plan, to effectively take a decent sized pay cut (again, in effective pay) to remain an employee.  This was brought up to Seagate higher ups and they basically said 'Live with it or take a hike'.  \r\n\r\nThere were frequent meetings throughout the year that were called different things 'All Hands' or 'Town Hall'.  These meetings were a nuisance due to their frequency, as well as their pep rally feel.  'Rah rah rah! We are doing so great! Our projections are through the roof!'  And then year end rolls around and we are all expecting raises and the tune suddenly changed 'Well..........we are doing good, we just aren't doing 'give raises out'-good.  In fact, layoffs!'  \r\n\r\n-Speaking of layoffs, they happened on an almost annual basis.  Fortunately, I had connections to know when they were coming but my colleagues did not.  The execution of the layoffs was done poorly.  Many talented people grew tired of it and left.  Morale was as bad as anywhere I have ever worked, and that includes a small business that was constantly on the verge of going out of business.\r\n\r\n-The high ups who were always talking in these meetings didn't seem very sharp to me.  Priorities and objectives constantly changed.  \r\n\r\n-Before we were merged into Seagate, we were able to work at home on occasion.  This was very helpful on days when I had a cold or otherwise needed to be at home.
