Team leads can stoop to any level to bring down someone, demean, mentally harass, threaten and blackmail the associates till they leave. Newly appointed team lead does not have any bare minimum basic mannerism of how to talk to people and can go to the extent of using cuss words even. Really wondering what kind of bizarre environment do they want to create at work place and even more so what qualities did the organization of such a repute see to hire and retain such team leads for last 8-9 years whereas people with quality and talent are not being retained (reason for recent high attrition at Novartis Hyderabad). A big question towards the attitude of management. Novartis has this so called SPEAKUP culture which is a total farce at least in Hyderabad. Do NOT FALL FOR THIS TRAP. Extreme level of regionalism being practiced. No matter how well you do, now matter how many accolades you accumulate from stakeholders nothing matters. Only bootlickers, sycophants, friends and Maharashtrians will be recognized and promoted. Do not think that if you are facing issues of harassment and non-sense from your manager the leadership will come to your support. Rather the leadership team along with your manger and hrbp will lay a trap for you. So beware. Horrible HR. Few uncivilized ill-mannered people from Odhisha who are half baked in terms of knowledge also are being given responsible position only to sabotage team unfortunately. Such is the level of their insecurity that they start practicing divide and rule within team, which is something that a well educated capable person with some dignity and integrity cannot take;but alas Novartis Hyderabad management and leadership team does not believe in promoting such people and giving them responsible position."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good for work from home", "cons": "Not very good for compensation"}, {"review_title": "Decent company to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Analyst in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance\r\nGood hybrid work policy", "cons": "Not so updated tech stack"}, {"review_title": "Great work culture", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Associate Applications Developer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Manageable work life balance.
