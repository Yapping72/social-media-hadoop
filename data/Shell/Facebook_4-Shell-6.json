This is the inception of how complicated every process here is.\r\n\r\nNow coming to performance they follow a CAR model capability attitude and relationship, the first 2 are mere eyewash the R is where the game begins it is a very convenient way of putting that if you have done the right favours to the right people you are in safe zone. There is also an exercise to measure employees potential now in this exercise people who even remotely do not know you will measure and estimate your potential on some eye washing points and now the gossip monging and the quid pro quo game starts. And even if you have really worked hard and someone wants to get back at you might just slip in a false observation and everything will be washed away. And if you report to the HR or your manager they also won't do anything as no one wants to ruffle feathers and spoil thier so called CEP or so called current estimated potential.so in a nutshell it's a culture that openly promotes management by perception and not hard work and even employees have also learnt which side their bread is buttered and focus more on perception management that leave across working hard but working at at in certain cases.\r\n\r\nNow let's move to attrition this is the only place where you will find a reorg happening at the drop of a hat and as a result your role no longer exist and your are expected to apply for the role you were fired from thus way the management saves on their attrition.and when you reapply it is not the skill set or your hard work but your network that matters and who us your God father. They put it very conveniently that in shell you find your own role which is nothing but to say there is no clear strategy in employee career progression and planning. It is all there on paper but nothing is ever implemented. \r\n\r\nAt times I felt that there is a little more job security in the fashion modelling world also than at shell. \r\n\r\nThe senior management can be extremely rude and disrespectful when talking to you and really treat you like trash but there is so much stress on practising good meeting behaviours but that is left to convenience and exercised at whims and fancies. Don't be surprised when a leader calls you in his office and you see his legs crossed on the table and asks you something and before you speak cuts you multiple times and then tells you that you are good for nothing. Of you are told to fill the people satisfaction survey in front of them and now you better know what scores you have to click on else there can be an re-org anytime and you might not get through the same job you were hired for and be pushed to any other role that you might not even like taking. But they say at shell we give you the opportunity to be who ever you want to and because you have to pay your bills you will take anything up. How convenient you see. \r\n\r\nAnd yet some people don't get tired of saying how great this place is but it is not true,  the importance of privileges are never realised till you have them ask those who are not get it, the so called blue eyed people and are deprived of basic human rights if dignity also."}, {"review_title": "Long time employment gone", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 May 2017", "job_title": "Finance Advisor in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "International company\r\nCompetitive salary and benefits\r\nTons of opportunities to work throughout the company (upstream, midstream, downstream)", "cons": "Global decision to pull out of Canada leaving only a skeleton of what used to be here\r\nFunctional areas like HR and finance offshored to India, Etc which can be difficult"}], [{"review_title": "Poor Management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "25 May 2017", "job_title": "Cashier/Cook in Moore, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "former co-workers was about the only great experience there.", "cons": "Never ordered the correct kitchen utensils, kitchen was filthy full of grease along the edges of the wall where fryer and grill were located.

You have to search/create/explore your own work, boss doesnt have work for you !!!\r\n7. Work life balance is only applicable if you have a good relation with your boss & are old enough in the company (read 5 years plus) & are ready to come in at any hours as required by your boss.\r\nComing to HR- No company would want such a HR, dont know how to handle difficult situations, they will make you feel guilty of things you never did. Guilty before proven otherwise and you dont get a chance to prove. \r\nDoesnt have a clue about why you are recruited and what to do with you. Incase of dispute, they act a self-proclaimed judge without getting to the thick of the matter. Hypocritisim is very clear. They try to hide over their failure to make use of resources by blaming things on your so called incompatibility.\r\n\r\nSalary- Though it may seem high at the start, as they have a certain salary band above the general market, however be sure that if you have joined in from outside, you are at the lowest grade of their band. A junior(campus recruit) would be higher paid and at a higher level than you for sure."}, {"review_title": "Good opportunities are available, but with frustrations due to bureaucracy and poor communication between functions.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Dec 2013", "job_title": "Engineer in Kuala Belait", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great opportunity to learn, grow and contribute to the business due to high activity levels.", "cons": "Working efficiency at cross functional levels need more alignments and improvements to drive continuous improvement."}, {"review_title": "I was a sales associate training to be Manager.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I am comfortable working with the public and enjoyed going to work everyday.", "cons": "I was in charge of ordering and delivery of all merchandise.

Your ability to network and stroke those egos matters more here than anything else. Your leaders recognize this and will be busy doing the same vs actually putting the success of their teams and their people first. They say the loudest one in the room is the weakest one in the room. Not so at Shell. \r\n- Job security issues -\r\nThere are \"transformations\" about every year now, which is our fancy term for figuring out which of our staff are expendable. If you're not let go, you're forced into another role, and there is little to no change management happening along the way, leading to many teams being understaffed and/or not knowing what they're doing. Our ambition to cut our carbon footprint by 50% is admirable, but the sacrifices and changes we will need to make are massive, and no one knows what to expect until they\u2019re staring redundancy in the face. \r\n- Flawed Performance Review Process \u2013 \r\nYou\u2019re measured against people that have a completely different role than yours, and by a panel of judges that have to thump their chests and fight over who among their staff gets the bigger bonus/raise. It\u2019s quite primitive, and the results seldom paint an accurate picture of an individual\u2019s actual contributions. We\u2019ve implemented a new review process but there is little to indicate this culture will go away. \r\n- Silos \u2013 \r\nLess staff means more people running around chasing deadlines and it has created silos within silos within silos. \r\n- Hypocrisy \u2013 \r\nShell\u2019s values and culture look great on paper. The reality however is that we\u2019re hiring more outsiders than ever before in a desperate attempt to inject new thinking and innovation \u2013 people that haven\u2019t been in Shell long enough to have those values ingrained and to truly embody our ideals. You will mostly feel that our talk about the importance of diversity and inclusion is lip service while you\u2019re putting on a mask and keeping honest feedback to yourself on a daily basis in order to play the political game Shell requires you to play. I have never been in an environment with so many people willing to stab you in the back to get ahead while smiling at you through their teeth, with leaders so often making generalizations about your character based on how you look and sound in a meeting. This is NOT an environment that encourages you to be yourself which is quite contradictory to what the company goes around saying about itself. \r\n- Work-life balance - \r\nLook elsewhere.
