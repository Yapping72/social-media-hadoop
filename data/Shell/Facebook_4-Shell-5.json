The problem with this \"evaluation\" is that you are compared with all employees worldwide who have been evaluated by their immediate Manager.  All \"evaluations\" are sent to HR and then people who do not even know you or your work performance are determining your future with Shell.  Shell uses this method of Forced Ranking to get rid of employees and hire less experienced employees to keep costs down.\r\nAlso there is little or no communication between upper management and the employees.  HR does not handle complaints for the employee but only for upper management.

It RUINS your life.\r\n\r\nThere are too many unnecessary practices at Shell. You often spend more time focusing on these unnecessary practices than focusing on work. \r\n\r\nShell claims to be the most innovative company. They may be the leading company in deep water exploration, but the term \"selective innovation\" would fit them better. The IT infrastructure is appalling. They still use the slow Internet Explore, older versions of Microsoft Office, poor expense statement portal, etc. There are times that you spend days and weeks for an IT problem to get fixed.\r\n\r\nSafety is important at Shell. However, I always got the impression that there was a greater focus on carrying a hot cup of coffee with a lid than process safety. It gets annoying after few months when they treat adults like kindergarten students over little safety issues such as coffee, how to warm up food in the microwave, etc. I picked up an injury in my hand because of poor office ergonomics.  Which one is more important, office ergonomics or carrying a hot cup of coffee with a lid? Some perspectives needs to be added.\r\n\r\nShell also makes you believe that they are the only company taking safety seriously where in fact many of the safety policies they practice are common industry practices. \r\nShell has become famous in industry for over-promising and under-delivering. I was with Shell from 2008 to 2015. Only one time a project met its deadlines and was under-budget. Projects often go over-budget with a huge margin. Something doesn't seem right when a company continuously goes over-budget and can't meet its deadline. \r\n\r\nShell isn't the most competitive company in terms of salary and benefits. HR acknowledges it, and they openly say that they are not planning to be the most competitive company. I received a considerable raise after I changed companies. \r\n\r\nThe gap between HR and employees is large, and people always complain about it. HR often provides little to no help to employees. Many \u201clessons learned\u201d meetings are scheduled, but no follow up action is taken on them. This is a very common practice at Shell.\r\nStay away from P&T unless you are well established in your role and have at least 10 years industry/ Shell experience. Shell P&T charges sites to do projects for them. See Shell P&T as an internal consulting company. The fact that Shell charges Shell makes no sense. Not only they charge sites, but the rates are outrageously high. Shell P&T claims that by charging sites, they keep the cash flow within the company. Sites claim they don\u2019t care who they pay as long as they can get what they want at a lower rate. Third party contractors normally get the job done a lot less expensive than Shell P&T. This situation creates negative chemistry between Shell P&T and sites. Of course, managers in Shell P&T don\u2019t see the tension because they don\u2019t go to sites, but employees feel it on daily basis. If you work in Shell P&T, you constantly need to keep your eyes open for new projects because you don\u2019t want to be in a situation that you charge overhead when your projects get cancelled. So not only you need to perform your daily projects but also need to be a good sales person to sell yourself to a group and keep your eyes open for other projects. This situation will easily distract people from their day to day job duties."}, {"review_title": "Great pay and benefits.

What is more important - once you accept a position, your first country of employment will become your BASE COUNTRY. It\u2019s now hard-coded into your profile. And it sucks because if for various reasons you move to another country in 99% cases you will not be relocated, even if you are a top performer. You can still go for so-called STIA (short-term international assignment), but that is 2 years max and also very difficult to get. The only way to change Base Country is to quit and reapply.

I see the company as part of the problem, not the solution. It's great to see that Shell acknowledges climate change, but there's really no substance behind it in my view.

IT extremely fearful of new ideas and way behind and HR is clueless.  IT decisions appear to be based exclusively on cost of maintaing system/software and not on value to end-users.  This results in tools being rolled out with features rendered shut down.  This reduces the cost of support.  But that is only because so many features have been shut down or configuration is so convoluted that the software is practically unusable.  So, obviously support costs are down because no one is using the software.  \r\n\r\nGreater offshoring of jobs, especially at the lower levels but also review of moving jobs at the next level.

Brand Name- You are working for one of the biggest brands in the world\r\n2. Salary package- Most employees come from service companies and the packages offered at Shell (IT Hub) are easily 1.5 times if not more. \r\n3. HSSE- The company really emphasizes on your safety. Sometimes, it is overwhelming.", "cons": "1. When the Shell IT Hub was conceptualized, the only thing on the minds of Senior Management was targets. Targets in terms of people employed per month/quarter/year. Due to this, brisk hiring began and resulted in lower than expected quality of employees joining. When these employees were given work, they failed to perform due to their inability and lack of quality. Such employees' probation period was extended and then most of them were fired. This resulted in 2 things:\r\n     a. A bad name for Shell that the company believes in Hire and Fire.\r\n     b. A dip in the targets, resulting in faster recruitment, again compromising quality and the       aforementioned vicious circle continues.\r\n2. Most of the workforce joined from service providers. They are hungry for onsite. Shell IT Hub being the low cost solution for IT capability, travel is severely restricted.This mismatch in expectations has led to employee satisfaction taking a big dip.\r\n3. Lack of Work from home option. The management cites the rulebook of Indian SEZ Act where it is mentioned that delivery is supposed to be from within the SEZ premises.However, we all have worked all our career in various companies based out of different SEZ locations and had never faced such stringent WFH policies. To add to it, any WFH should be approved by manager and HR, as if we are kids. Totally unacceptable.\r\n4. Huge parity can be felt between the office comforts, standards and policies of Shell Global vs Shell IT Hub. This step motherly treatment is definitely noticed by the employees.\r\n5. Unique salary structure. On paper, the CTC is huge. But all components are taxable. Even components provided by the Govt for tax exemption are not given. Ex no conveyance, no travel allowance. Stupid structure with an equally stupid management not agreeing to change it is disappointing.\r\n6. No car lease policy. \r\n7. Supposed lock-in period of 4 years per role and job-group. Though not followed stringently globally, this policy is followed only in Shell IT Hub.\r\n8. Bad insurance policy for self and family. The bare minimum cover amount is provided to employees. Even service companies give better insurance. Insurance for parents has to be 'bought' at exorbitant rates. Ex 44k for a 5 lac cover.

Having worked for a number of years enough to know a company from inside out, I can only say that it is big let down for bright talents which they hire from top colleges (IITs). Given the brand name it has, campus recruits are easily sucked into the brand only to relalize later that it is nothing but a joke especially for the oil and gas people. The quality of work is pathetic. Even somebody working in a 3rd tier oil and gas contractor in the US will have a much wider knowledge and perspective of the industry and technicalities. Just because of the Indian talent in this company, it has not gone to that level. But on the contrary, there are some people who even do not know the difference between a casing and a tubing after working for 3 years in Shell India.\r\nNow coming to the management, they can be best termed as a bunch of jokers and hypocrites who are fooling around with the careers of young talents. They can go upto any extent in situations of adversity, even to the extent of laying off people deliberatly. The management, most of whom comprise of the fairer skin are treated like kings in India. Right from the facilities, cars, drivers, the best in class villa accomodation and what not, they still crib about India, They even claim openly about the beaurocracy that has imbibed into this corporate environmnet. Some of these jokers even claim and boast about who stays and who goes from the company. It is understood that it is a bad time for the industry and you are seeing layoffs across it. But the behaviour and the conduct of the managemnet at this point of crisis is pathetic. Its a saying that your character is tested at the time of adversity. And these people have failed miserably. Work life balance sometimes goes to new low where people spend 12-18 hours in the office and his boss spends 12-18 hours holidaying simultaneously. Nevertheless, inspite of the environment, people have excelled and grabbed onto other opportunities which Shell as global brand, no doubt, provides. But I pity people who somehow are stuck in there for the last n number of years. We as desi junta are the ones who are generally trapped. People cannot leave their job just because they do not like it. They work inspite of it as they have a number of liabilities and responsibilities which have to be taken care off. I even apprehend that the mangement has understood the mentality and somehow are tapping into these insecurities. Enough said about the top quartile of Shell Bangalore.\r\nNow for the HR, I have seen enough in the other posts. So I will not go into it except the fact that sometimes I felt that there is a expat/HR nexus under the carpet and rules are customized as per the convenience of the top quartile.\r\nTo end I would again like to reiterate that Shell as a global brand is good but the Indian version of it is pathetic and will go down the drains someday if it continues with the current practices."}, {"review_title": "Great employer but horrible HR policies", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunities and training\r\nCompensation and Benefits\r\nAbility to work remotely, overall flexibility \r\nTravel opportunities", "cons": "Horrible HR policies - during downsizing, people are forced to reapply for their own positions and compete against each other for extended periods of time.
