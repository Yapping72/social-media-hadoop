No clarity from the management side.\r\n2. Over-politics, Extreme Bias, managers only say vague words, for example when asked about FOW, before the email came officially, nobody will speak about it.\r\n3.There are few preferred people by managers over others and they get to know all information. Rest sit like ducks.\r\n4. Lack of responsibility especially seen in MOST JG5 or higher people, they just think they can treat us, JG6 people like slaves.\r\n5. No respect, no value, nothing, it is a thankless job since Stakeholders often threaten us, and while you are at it, meaning hiring new people, I would say, give them a disclaimer, you are going to be treated as slaves. \r\n6. Managers especially LM's are for what? They only have a motley group of people wherefrom they think they can reap all benefits.\r\n7. Often LM's ask \"How much did you bring to the table?\"- As a reply I would say \"I am working as an associate data scientist in Renewable Energy work which involves a thorough research and thinking and it's value cannot be immediately realized. So then I am value-less to you if you think it is so. Also when I have repeatedly asked the stakeholders to liaise with the LM to give a clarity about the value I have generated, neither the stakeholders do that, sometimes they don't even know that! Now after repeated asking also if they do not say how much value I generated, you are silent, why?\"\r\n8. I work for more than 12 hours, now you may be saying - \"No No this will tell upon your health and so on\". I call it Fussing or showing artificial care and all. Nonsense! I also need to work on weekends and public holidays to make my ends meet. You see a research problem needs thinking, innovation, now what Shell does- Take a code left over by someone else and now work upon it and if you want to change it, the stakeholders will immediately say \"Why are you doing this? We can't change the code.. What will happen in the next year, do we need to change the code again!\". Now narrow minded stakeholders- \"If the data changes, what options do you have?\". They now talk about reusability of code, most of them don't even know how to code properly.\r\n9. No communication between peers, only a handful of them does. If I try to participate in many events, I will be labeled as someone seeking \"Extra Attention\".\r\n10. JG6 or lower Associate Data Scients and Analysts need at least a 25% hike. Else We will openly, but anonymously revolt on social networks, everywhere. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US, YOU THINK WE ARE SLAVES, YOU SEE IF THE SLAVES(WHOM YOU TREAT AS SLAVES) START REVOLTING, YOUR PYRAMIDS WILL FALL APART. KINDLY WATCH THE MOVIE 10000 BC.
