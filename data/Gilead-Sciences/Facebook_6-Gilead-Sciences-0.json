Whole viral cure pipelines were bought from research institutes, most of them are not working, but the RnD management insists to develop useless garbage given the money they've spent on licensing them in. \n\nThe environment of biology RnD is profoundly toxic, the managers fight for projects from the upper-level management, and they sabotage and undermine each other all the time. The employee under them don't talk to each other, but always report other to managers. No collaboration within the department, people see each other as snitches. \n\nNo matter how politically correct it advocates here, the people who got promoted are all white males who discriminate against people of color, especially look down upon scientists who are immigrants from foreign countries where English is not the prime language. A lot of them have no credentials, no experience only got promoted due to knowing how to play politics there. \n \nThe base pay is terrible in Bay Area, worse than most of the biotech startups. People are very unhappy here, nobody smiles, and my coworkers who stay here longer than 3 years only stay here for the underpaid salary. The department discourages employees' passion, creativity, and scientific curiosity, the only people who can thrive are people who are calculated, sophisticated sometimes vicious.   \n\nSTAY AWAY STAY AWAY STAY AWAY"}, {"review_title": "Great Place to Accelerate Development and Learn from Senior Leaders", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Feb 2022", "job_title": "OCM Lead in Raleigh, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great management who understands how to lead people, approachable senior leaders who are willing to provide opportunities and a culture that tangibly demonstrates inclusiveness.

Many employees have told me their one-word to describe Gilead. The most frequent one is \"soul-crushing\" which is technically two words I guess. \"Abyss\" is another common one. I personally refer to Gilead as \"Gulag\" because it better resembles what the actual company is. Gilead is just a hyped up patent trolling company that has 0 original research in their portfolio. Other companies in the market cap size of Gilead spend hundreds of millions on finding new proteins and targets to go after. What does Gilead do? Gilead exclusively focuses on finding established patents on hot targets from other companies, then puts a bunch of chemists and tells them to find one differentiation point that can allow them to patent a compound. The die-hard med chemists then proceed to make 3000 compounds as if their whole lives are on the line (their mindset is very similar to the Chinese patent trolling companies), tweaking every single thing until they get some point of differentiation between the competition and their structure. This is a common tactic in pharma, but Gilead is arguably the only company with its market cap size that exclusively (more than 95% of the time) relies on this method. \r\nNow, management is just full of die-hard people who want to advance their own career, and in this scenario, only numbers matter. Not quality of work. Just numbers. How many compounds did you make? How many assays did you run? That kind of thing. \r\n Every form of management (from the managers who just have one supervised individual) to those high up are just thinking about themselves and not about how to support their supervised individuals. I bet if they did then the efficiency of the company would actually rise above its current levels. But hey why actually make your employees want to come to work? They should always be miserable working their jobs right?\r\nIf you're looking for a job anywhere, just don't come to Gilead in their research departments. You'll probably develop alcoholism like 90% of the employees in the research departments. Don't even worry about your mental health.

Pay was average. I used to work in the manufacturing at Immunomedics, acquired by Gilead in Oct 2020. I worked there for about three years. I worked with some really amiable and talented people before they left for other opportunities. When I first started in 2017, the department was awesome. The people were awesome, the management was awesome, and the culture was awesome. By the end of 2020, everything had changed; it was a gradual descent over the years into a cesspool of toxicity, backstabbing, and maniacal narcissism.", "cons": "Things changed when the management changed. The middle level management team I started with in 2017 was completely replaced by mid 2020. Mid level management left because upper level management was extremely disconnected from reality. Upper level management goals were absurd; clearly, some of them failed remedial algebra. If upper management left their offices and walked around the building, they would see the limitations of the facility, equipment, and staffing.\r\n\r\nThe department was incredibly understaffed when I worked there. Ironically, after the acquisition, the department is now even more understaffed. Several people quit in early 2020 and plans were made to replace them but never executed upon. More people left after the acquisition. I heard only one person will be hired to replace the four people who left. 1 = 4? The new management in the department seeks to squeeze as much juice out of the remaining employees as possible. Understaffed, overworked, and unappreciated.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the department is no longer what it used to be. Now, the culture is really toxic; it is an atmosphere supported by horrible mid level management. The wrong people became supervisors and managers. Any good managers have been pushed out and isolated and will remain isolated until they quit. Perception is king here now.\r\n\r\nAlso, the new management only rewards the employees they favor. Whether those employees actually do any work is optional. The management holds yearly bonuses and promotions as hostage. If you want a bonus or promotion, you have to curry favor. To curry favor, you have to stab your co-workers in the back. If anyone makes a mistake, the first one to point a finger gets rewarded.\r\n\r\nNew management exacerbates problems instead of fixing them. They readily blame lower level employees, scapegoating them for issues beyond their control. The worst part is the toxic environment changed the personalities of some of the co-workers I worked with.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, I joined the company for the people, the culture, and the opportunity to grow as an employee. I left because now there is none of that.

I cannot stress enough the fact that Gilead is full of sociopaths. \r\n\r\nThen there is the discrimination, most European offices don't have people of colour working there of if they do, they are in junior positions. There is a bias to hire majority of women to open positions. Gilead has an imbalance with regards to gender diversity however, the positive hiring policy is getting out of hand. \r\n\r\nThere is, surprisingly, the homophobia, from both hetor- and homosexual members of staff; I have seen it first hand....the sexual harassment which goes unreported. \r\n\r\nThe rest (micro management, cut throat culture and environment...resourcing with the human and a real lack of work/life balance....its viscous) \r\n\r\nDan O'Day may have fired the old guard from the C-Suite but the rot continues at VP/Snr Dir/Dir levels, right down to affiliate level. Unless there is a conscious effort made to change this, Gilead will never really change. \r\n\r\nLikely there will be a shake up by end of 2020 given the loss of HCV and HIV revenues and way too much being spent on oncology pipeline. \r\n\r\nIf you are someone who is happy to step on a colleagues head to get ahead, this is the company for you. You will excel and grow quickly. If you are a normal human being who wants career advancement, who wants to work in a friendly company then this is NOT the company for you. \r\n\r\nWatch out for the golden handcuffs, Gilead pay way above the industry average for overqualified personnel. When you eventually leave, don't expect the same salary."}, {"review_title": "work", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Clinical Lab Assistant in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "its a job that pays the bills", "cons": "communication is bad between departments"}, {"review_title": "Good tools management needs improvement", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Talent Acquisition Specialist in Foster City, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Tools are available and resources are helpful", "cons": "Talent acquisition manager needs improvement"}, {"review_title": "Formidable work load", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Senior Director in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Growth opportunities to develop career \r\nInclusive and diverse", "cons": "No work life balance\r\nToo much turn over"}, {"review_title": "Good Place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Data Scientist in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work - nothing to add", "cons": "nothing comes to mind - positive experience"}, {"review_title": "Good company, workload can be reduced.

Middle management (me) has to tow the line no matter what.  It's not about doing your job well, it's about kowtowing to your manager and making them feel powerful and in control, and making sure you are falling in line.  Saving face.  Looking good.  Putting other people down.  Scapegoating.  Those are the real Gilead core values.  This is the first place I have worked where there merit doesn't really factor into the equation - it's about who likes you.  In fact, if you try to do something to help your department or company, those are the very they will find a way to admonish you for.  (At other companies, these types of efforts are usually lauded.)

But be careful and watch your back.  Everyone there - everyone - all the way on up the chain, has to watch their backs.  You fall out of favor one day and you are O-U-T out.  In clinical operations, your senior management will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat - I have seen it happen time again to colleague.  It's as if Gilead takes it's people - it's most valuable resource - and just crushes the soul of of them.

I would tolerate a lot if I was in that situation too. For the rest of us 97% of former and current Gilead employees, the situation is not a happy. For starters,\r\n1. As mention on other reviews, Gilead does like to run lean on resources, this would not be a bad thing in itself if management reward job performance other than the cost of living pay increases every year. I think the employee handbook mentioned something about a work/life balance but I really believe management has their own version of the employee handbook that states 99% work and 1% life balance.\r\n2. My observation of management it seems, incompetent managers seem to keep their jobs if they know how to play the Gilead culture game, work your subordinates to the bone and keep the bottom line lean. I really think that maybe about 70% of the managers at Gilead lack people management skills or have none at all.  \r\n3. Some of the review that state Gilead does not perform employee surveys are wrong, they have done 2 company wide company and management surveys since I've been there, although that's 2 surveys in the over 8 years I've been with the company. Executive management knows there is a morale issue lately and have conducted the surveys in attempts to say \"hey, we care and listen to you!\". The results of the surveys were not that flattering for executive and upper management. \r\n4. It seems that every time senior director or vice president joins the company from outside of Gilead, people lose their jobs because new management wants to \"bring in their own people\". You have more of a chance of being struck by lightening then losing your job because of a direct result of the company's financial condition. I've seen a lot of people lose their job or forced out because management wanted to clean out and bring in a \"new crew\". \r\n5. Company culture is very strange to me. Gilead is a very successful in what Gilead does, brings successful drugs to the market, makes tons of money and makes investors happy most of the time but Gilead's company culture is like a start up or a struggling company because of the \"we like to run a lean company\" = many people wear many hats and you are expected to perform outside of your job responsibilities many times. This related to the work/life balance point I made earlier. There are many pluses to running lean and in certain situations, it's almost a requirement but Gilead either knows it's employees are suffering in the work/life balance area or Gilead is way more concerned about reporting to stock holders that management is running a \"tight ship\", music to investors ears. \r\n\r\nThe reason I rated only 2 starts is because the ratio between pros and cons is in the cons favor."}, {"review_title": "Zero Culture but Successful Science pays off", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "24 Mar 2014", "job_title": "Therapeutic Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great scientific leadership team has made some excellent product and market decisions.\r\nAmazing upper management team.

I feel sick every day and I can't sleep.  I know many other people with stress and sleep problems because they are miserable.\r\n\r\nI am a scientist and 'research' here is a pathetic group of backstabbing know-nothings. Middle management doesn't have the experience necessary to perform quality research.  Post-docs (with no industry experience) are hired to mange associates with 20+ years industry experience then direct these miserable associates to repeat and repeat and repeat the most idiotic of tasks.  Research suffers because middle management will not hire experienced people.  It's my opinion that management will not hire experienced people because they don't want to be questioned or challenged by people who actually know what they are doing!\r\n\r\nIt should also come as no surprise that all of Gilead's HIV and HCV drugs were purchased from other companies or were 'fast follow-ons' based on other companies patents.  There isn't a creative bone to be found any where in research. Research is a farce.  Management will make you repeat assays if they don't like the results and, if management still doesn't like your results, it's your fault!\r\n\r\nOh so you want a promotion? If you do not sacrifice your family, life, and sanity to Gilead, forget ever being promoted.  There is ZERO work-life balance.  No matter how hard you work, you will not be rewarded unless your boss is skilled at managing Gilead's politics!  Managers have to fight with each other to get associates promoted and, if your boss isn't in the 'in crowd', you will never get promoted or even recognized for the work you do. Also, yearly ratings are based on a bell curve which means someone must always be at the bottom of the curve.  It's not hard to pick out which poor sod will be the next to get axed based on 'who is the director's pet'.  And then management is applauded for 'getting rid of the dead weight'.  To me, as a manager, you can only be as good as your worst performer.  So, if your employees are not performing, it's the manager's fault. But that is not how it works at Gilead.\r\n\r\nPolitics is the key. Even if you perform all of your work, someone else will get credit for it.  I had the bad experience of showing someone how to perform an assay only to have them get credit for developing it!  What a slap in the face!  But it's politics, this person's boss was the director's favorite and basically untouchable so there was nothing I could do even though I presented the data to this same group well before this person got credit for my work.  \r\n\r\nOh - do you still want to work for Gilead?  Well here is the kicker - I have NEVER worked at a company where people just up and quit!  Like ---> quit without having a new job lined up!  People become so incredibly stressed they simply can not take it any more and leave.\r\n\r\nPlease! Do yourself a favor.

Every time without fail when an employee starts to show leadership potential they force them out (GP, CW, YX, SD(G), YG, JW, CM, GM, SH) and many many more! There is definitely a feeling that those in the \"manager\" band feel threatened by their employees attempts to move up, take more responsibility, and blaze their own trail. Often the employees MUST create their own path because there is no direction given to the employees or if there is direction it changes daily (not exaggerating).\r\n\r\n3) The lack of leadership and management is supported by the worst HR department I have ever worked with. HR is very anti-employee and unprofessional and seems to take delight in stomping on the little girl, or guy for that matter.\r\n\r\n4)Worst internal promotion system I have ever seen. Gilead Oceanside does not promote from within. It takes 2-3 years of having exceeded ratings and approval by all the other managers to get promoted (unless you are HR of course). It is a popularity contest. For corporate Gilead one could get promoted at mid-year or at the end of the year. For Gilead Oceanside you can only get promoted at year end because \"we don't promote at mid-year here\" ....WHAT?....Very few exceptions are made for this unwritten rule. That's right, if you ask for the written policy it will never be provided. Another example: Pretend you have someone above you in your department leave or an opening is created that is only 1 level above you. One might think that you could apply and have a reasonable chance of getting the position because you have been with the company for 5 years, you are already doing the job, and you have exceeded or better performance reviews. NO...No no no. You will never get the job because \"it is something we just don't do\". Gilead would much rather hire externally and in many cases place someone with ZERO experience in that position and expect you to train them. Do not go to this location and expect to climb the ladder...that is unless you are part of the old guard from Genentech.\r\n\r\n5) The QA department over regulates instead of regulating smartly causing deviation after deviation after deviation.

There have been multiple instances of drunken vagrants on the property, thefts, vandalism, people using drugs, and even an attempted assault on a scientist where a trespasser pick up a chair and tried to smash a window to get to the scientist. The Gilead Manager in charge of Security keeps changing but the policies do not. They refuse to restrict access to the facility by means of a fence (every other company in the area has one for a reason), every time the security team starts to make progress the head security officer gets fired from the company (the last one when he was on vacation). Gilead Oceanside will continue to wait until something serious happens and then react, like always.\r\n\r\n7) Frankly I am getting tired of writing the cons as they could continue for quite a bit. If you are the type to put your head down, love micromanagement, keep mouth shut, and collect a paycheck this is the place for you. If you ask why, attempt any continuous improvement initiatives or show any sort of leadership and ambition...run away.

Due to numerous acquisitions this department grew exponentially without the support and ability to manage it - especially when it came to the managers.  Many of the managers are incompetent when it comes to managing staff, and they should undeniably remain individual contributors.  Trained, interested and trusting managers keep people.  Micromanaging, lost and often-incorrect managers do not keep people.  Unfortunately I found that there is no recourse to resolve issues with management as no measures were taken to improve the situation despite many, many, warning signs.\r\n\r\nAs other reviewers have noted, it's your time at Gilead, not your talents.
