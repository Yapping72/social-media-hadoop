So if it take you 1 hr 15 mins to get to your store you can only count the 15 mins into your time. Also the sales goals are unfair and not realistic, in the big box side they compare all of the numbers to the prior year and you don't get a full bonus unless you finish each qtr 4% over the goal. So with he numbers being compared directly to the year before it can be hard to constantly grow sales 4% year after year so to think of you grew sales 1-3% they would barely give you any bonus, but think you increased sales but wasn't rewarded for it.
