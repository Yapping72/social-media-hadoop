But don't stay too long!", "cons": "Sector: Company has a major \"Identity Crisis\". Even the founders can't decide what sector they are in. Over the past 6 years, I heard \"We are a design company\", \"We are a hospitality company\", \"We are a travel company\", \"We are a tech company\" (the last, certainly NOT!)\r\nThen, time to time they decide to play Global Peace Watchers! (Like suspending listings in Israel) and hurt business dearly. Also, Hong Kong is not happening apparently, because China is full speed ahead! \r\n\r\nPR: Random, tone deaf ad campaigns. Remember the tax Posters in SF... Dear god...\r\n\r\nProduct: Never ending product experiments being rolled out without a crust of communication to users or teams. \r\n\r\nManagement: Most of the management are in the management because they were there at the beginning and have no qualifications to be in management roles. Also you will find out very soon that most of the lower management (e.g. Supervisors, Operation Managers are \"referrals\" of Regional Managers or other Operations Managers... So tribalism is very much alive and well!) \r\n\r\nPay: You will be paid average 20/30 % less for the same role compared to other companies in the area. Money is scarce for lower level employees but management gets insane bonuses! Hope you have strong nerves! \r\n\r\nTravel: You were able to travel a lot when I joined. They were very flexible. Past couple of years managers are the only ones who travel around. I have heard Operations Managers who never talked to a single host travelling to host meet ups... Just because!\r\n\r\nDublin: You are a satellite office. Do not expect your \"ideas\" to be taken seriously by HQ in SF. Something you may have thought of and can be implemented with a couple of lines of codes, will usually be lost in feedback void. A few months or in Airbnb's case, YEARS later you may hear they hired a project manager and a dozen other people just to implement the very same you thought of 3 years ago... \r\n\r\nSingapore: The step child that sleeps on the floor next to fire place.\r\n\r\nSF: Just like all the other US centric companies in the area, SF is where magic happens (or that's what they think). \r\n\r\nMobility: Forget it. Some people were told if they move away from their current team, even for temporary assignments, they wouldn't be able to come back or their job may not be there when they come back. Who says stuff like that!? \r\n\r\nCulture and Values: They only mean something if they are actually exercised. Core Values do not count for jack in your reviews or career growth. It's just fluff talk. Do not fall for that trap!\r\n\r\nCEO: Sounds like he sits with a couple of people and gets easily influenced. For company that is not really that big in terms of organisation size, he is mostly disconnected from what's happening in the lower levels and community. I have never seen a CEO apologising so many times for a so many things. Approx 2-3 times per year...\r\n\r\nOverall: Not a great moment to join Airbnb at the moment.

The fast growth also adds to the ownership and career advancement opportunities, since a relatively short tenure at Airbnb can become seniority with all of the expansion and hiring.  Additionally I feel like I've learned a ton both from other engineers and working collaboratively with designers, data scientists, and producers (product managers).

If there is one thing I am thankful for in the whole EU economical crisis debacle, it would be for giving me the opportunity to work with such a diverse group of people with vastly different backgrounds (students, architect, former advertising professional, film-makers, pastry chef, lawyer...) who all happened to work in customer support at that particular point in their life.\r\n\r\nAirbnb would organize meet-ups about once a year to enable colleagues to meet in person. This was particularly nice because most of us worked remotely, so we only knew each other via Gchat and meetings. It was always a very exciting time as together we came up with some great new ideas, and always enjoyed meeting our friends (some of my closest friends now are former Airbnb colleagues). The geographical flexibility is being removed, and centralized offices set up, so I don't know if the meet-ups will be a perk moving forward.\r\n\r\nOn top of our monthly salary (EU), we received a quarterly $500 coupon to use on Airbnb reservations - great incentive for employees to use the product and see for themselves what traveler experience is like, and make suggestions based on real-life experience.\r\n\r\nI loved the concept of Airbnb from the moment I discovered it in 2011, and I still do. The idea of making the most of an empty space at a certain time, and thus enabling people to partially rent out a space they might not be able to afford otherwise is great. I also loved the idea of working for a company that didn't create waste as part of its business. Unfortunately, I found during visits to HQ in San Francisco that even though European offices were being incredibly careful about their expenditures, no such thing could be said about HQ.", "cons": "I know I'm an idealist, but I am sad that no measures were taken to prevent property managers who run between 10 and 100 flats to use Airbnb in markets where real estate is already incredibly expensive. That was not the idea behind Airbnb, and this is what now hurts Airbnb's reputation (but brings in big bucks). I feel that as the company has grown, even though Customer Experience agents were always pushed for personal connection with the clients, the company's ethics shifted towards profit regardless of what the original values were. If that is not the case, statements such as \"we were offered XX but refused because of our principles\" would be great, so we feel like we are all in one boat, and working with a purpose other than just our investors' short-term profits.\r\n\r\nI loved the general values that were defined by the kind of people who were hired a few years ago.  Sadly, the official \"Core Values\" presented to us later on felt patronizing, because they were giving us self-explanatory and unnecessary guidelines on how to treat customers and colleagues. When you hire good people who care about your product, customers, and team, you have to trust that they will act accordingly. Employees in general do not like being made to feel like you don't trust their basic judgement.\r\n\r\nI understand that I worked with Airbnb at a time when it was growing exponentially, and there are growing pains, however the European Customer Experience employees went through a really hard time given the type of job and pay they received when they were all asked to relocate to new countries (for some of them twice within the same year). A bit more foresight would have been a good thing, and would have made Airbnb as an employer look more credible. \r\n\r\nOne other important point: even though most of my colleagues were a joy and pleasure to work with, and we made a good overall team, I will say that there were a few elements whose lack of care (as in, *did not care*, not careless mistakes) hurt our reputation for excellent customer service more times that I can count, and nothing tangible was done to help. A reporting of bad practices and re-training program was apparently in place, but never seemed to deliver results. I saw a few people fired extremely quickly, but never in the case of people who repeatedly (multiple times a week basis) hurt our work. This was very frustrating to everyone picking up the pieces and trying to calm down some rightfully angry customers. Let's aim for excellence all the way - also with contractors.\r\n\r\nThe end of my time at Airbnb (9 months ago) was very disappointing. I do not believe I was treated with the respect and professionalism I had earned through my hard work and very strong dedication every day for almost two years, and was sad to notice that I was not alone.  Living and working in Germany involves lots of red tape, and Airbnb was not up to standard in delivering paperwork in a timely manner, nor did they even have a HR representative responsible for Germany at a time when a significant number of the employees in Germany ended their contracts.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed by the lack of professionalism displayed by HR representatives, and by the lack of transparency on mid-management's role (from our perspective their names just popped up in emails and meetings when new random goals were being set, with no explanation). Whether due to frustration on their part because they weren't given the tools/time/support needed from management, or simply because they did not realize/care, I'm not sure, but it was not satisfactory from the employee side. It's one thing to say \"we want to do everything we can to help\", and it's another to actually go ahead and show that at a difficult time.

No one's word means anything at Airbnb. People say one thing one day and then the next day they do a different thing. This is not me being resistant to innovation or change. I'm talking about basics like meetings you've set up, human resources issues, or even just responding to emails. You really can't rely on anyone to do what they promised. People don't communicate well and there are few people who take responsibility for their actions. People with no experience or expertise make decisions that make absolutely no sense to the people putting those policies into effect. Management rarely communicates to the employees who have to execute these changes nor the community of users who rely on the site what they are planning to change. Airbnb is losing the group of hosts who first joined them before it was a cause celebre, the ones who helped them get where they are today, and it's a shame. It's also losing smart, devoted employees who are tired of being subject to the whims, empty promises, and poor management skills of their supervisors. If you are a smart, mature person with integrity you will have a hard time here because most of the employees are not grown up and do not value or possess critical thinking skills.

I know the sales management is working on this and have seen some improvements, but it's still something to be aware of. \r\n\r\nGuest-facing roles can be extremely stressful for those who are not accustomed to working with very wealthy people.  Most guests are perfectly pleasant people, but the stress of working with huge amounts of money can be very difficult.\r\n\r\nAll told, it's not so much that the work is hard. However, it does require tremendous focus and can be draining. I got lucky in that my manager is extremely supportive and understanding.

To me, the most defining difference of Airbnb from other companies I have seen is the company's mission and positive, well-cultivated work culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n Although Airbnb is a for-profit corporation, we put a lot of stress on in our mission - \"belong anywhere\". Before I traveled on Airbnb after becoming an employee, I had different kinds of traveling experiences and have started to think traditional quick and hurried ways of travel is not right and even possibly wrong. Although Airbnb makes money from guests and hosts, we also try hard to communicate the reason why you should start traveling with locals on Airbnb, instead of using hotels. Travel experiences on Airbnb are very different from person to person and can be transformative. I feel I work for a company that can change the way people think about traveling.\r\n\r\nAirbnb has a distinctive culture. People are smart and at the same time have interesting stories to share, and everyone values learning from others. During my cultural fit interview (Airbnb is the only company for which I have ever done a culture fit interview for an engineering position), one of my interviewers asked me \u201cwhat can you teach me right now?\" That was one of the most difficult interview questionsI have ever had. After a bit of hesitation, I taught my interviewer how to practice standing meditation, which I learned just a week before the interview at an Insight Meditation session. We ask this question to many candidates. We encourage people to share a \"fun fact\" when you are first introducing yourself or when you are presenting at team meetings. I have learned people at Airbnb have so many interesting experiences to share and feel humbled to work with them everyday. We have a \"Hands on Nerds\" session organized by one of our engineers where we teach \"skills\" to each other - these can be technical or be non-technical like how to do screen printing or how to dance Bhangra, an indian traditional dance. This culture also applies to day-to-day work. After an incident caused by human errors is resolved, engineers write a postmortem and share it with all product team members to teach and share, not to blame and ask for an apology. Senior engineers are willing to spend time discussing your mistakes to help you become a better engineer. Every weekly engineering meeting starts with appreciation time when people thank others who helped them or had done great work in that week.\r\n\r\nFor a general perspective about working at Airbnb, read other people's reviews. Factors like compensation, hours, and perk matter to me and what is being said by others is largely true. But for me, the mission and the culture are more important reasons that makes me feel excited to go to work everyday.", "cons": "I cannot think of major cons except for things might happen at any other hyper-growth company.

The leadership is making an agenda that is not acting like a role model for the rest of the team (start at 10am and end at 4 or 5pm), they are jetlagged from the rest of the team, their day to day stress and reality.\r\n- Inexperience is also reflected by their incomplete capability to get rid of a backlog or triage queues or suggest urgent improvement of work flows and processes.\r\n- It is unclear if this incapacity is at least brought to the awareness of this leadership. If they are aware and are doing nothing, this is quite serious.\r\n- It appears that the team is on a state of depression. We have seriously the best people in this team, incredibly experienced, resourceful and leadership treat them like kids. Projects or tasks are given in an arbitrary manner.  Politics are strong.

If you are criticizing, still in a constructive manner, you will be seen as a disrupter and you will be impacted negatively (career progress stopped)\r\n- Since almost a year a transformation/reorganization was planned. No clear communication, time-line, or update. The usual blur illustrated with cute images in internal newsletter. Lately, they decided to change the spirit animal of the team (very primary school) going from wolf to elephant. For the occasion we were invited to a pre-recorded meeting in which real people had elephant costumes (zoo style). They gave a useless coins with the face of an elephant on them. They spent money on that. All the agents did not see an increase in the salary for more than 2 years. Knowing the cost of living in Dublin, the absurd rents and underpaid agents are facing dramatic situations. The higher and intermediate management do not see it and the team is bleeding its workforce. We are spending our time to train people that we know will leave before their 6th month or first year. \r\n- It is unclear of the reorganization will change a thing, particularly when the Crisis Response Team will be merged in the new Community Support team (aka customer service erzatz).

Lots of talented people don't make the cut because they failed to make a good impression on the core values interviews. It's Airbnb's way of weeding out people who aren't a \"good fit\" for their clique.\r\n-- Very cliquey, feels like a frat. If you fit in, you'll like it. If you don't, you won't. Emphasis on drinking at company events. Overheard multiple people on different occasions making straight up sexist remarks during and after work.\r\n-- Poor work-life balance.
