They took away options for external continuous learning (certifications, paying for SHRM/HRCI, conferences, etc) which hurts the HR team from staying up on their skill-set and thinking outside the box, They took away many opportunities for promotions (they are inconsistently applied and whether unintentional, eludes to favoritism), and they restructured their merit process....if you want to call it a merit process at all. I could go into detail about how ridiculous this strategy is but I will refrain in this review. Just know that a majority, and I mean a majority, of the population does not see any financial fruits of their exceptionally hard work. Their internal equity also needs to be re-evaluated and corrected but they do not want to invest the money in labor costs. Like many companies, the talent market is demanding a higher salary to join H-D. That has left many loyal, long time employees making the same or less that the people coming on now. Further, they are very top heavy with highly compensated leaders and leave those at the lower levels with the stress of producing a tremendous amount of work. And I am not speaking of HR specifically. It is across the board. Bottom line, they may say they care about their employees, but their actions are showing otherwise. It is sad to me for sure. I used to love it there.

Meanwhile, the executive managers and leadership continue to receive large stock option payouts while the people who do the work struggle.\n\nCompany is losing so many people across the board, that the remaining people are required to pick up the slack which adds to their workload, for the same amount of compensation. Be prepared to manage more than just the workload laid out in the Job Description that you apply for. \nYou can work on a vehicle or design for years and never be allowed the opportunity to test and evaluate your components because ONLY LEADERSHIP is allowed to ride and test the new product. If you aren't leadership, you only get to ride the new product at demo events after it is launched.

I\u2019ve been very fortunate to find work elsewhere, but H-Ds treatment was horrible.\n\nThe director I worked under was hands down the worst leader I\u2019ve ever encountered. He had a history of failures but rather than getting rid of him he was just moved around where his failures would have a lower impact. He offered no insight or support for the department. People referred to him as a \u201cbulldog\u201d because he\u2019d lose his mind on people (scream, swear) in meetings...and they acted like that was a compliment. That sums up the H-D culture in a nutshell.\n\nBeyond that, I was completely on my own from day one. No one offered any training or help. No one seemed to even know how to do their own jobs. Leadership was constantly changing, and each time they overhauled everything just to put their own signature on things, halting any progress. They threw out any plans to build a viable future with Jochen zeitz coming in and pandering to investors that are looking for a quick cash in before H-D takes its final hits with its aging demographic and goes under.\n\nI went from feeling like a confident, accomplished professional with 10 years of great experience to being completely beat down, berated and having my confidence destroyed in under a year.

It is rare that a project will finish with at least 25% of the the original team members that started on it.  Forget about performance reviews as it is not uncommon to be shuffled around like a deck of cards and work under different manager over the course of a year that have no clue of your skill set, experiences or prior achievements.   \r\n\r\nManagement has no clear direction except time lines and it is not uncommon to get an email at 2:00pm requesting a new task to be completed before COB without regards to your other work commitments.  If you don't deliver you will get \"you did not meet my expectations and are not planning for success\".  Managers will talk out of both sides of their mouth and never make commitments, while having perfect 20/20 hind sight on why missed deadlines are due to your lack of commitment.  Going above and beyond to resolve issues is rarely recognized and will usually come back to bite you.  CYA is the name of the game there so if you do take a job make sure you save every email.  Ask for help on a project and the typical response is \"get me your action plan for how you are going to resolve this\".  \r\n\r\nThere are just too many layers of managers leading to a high level of dysfunction.  Excessive paperwork and documentation on their design methodology prevents any time for true innovation or design work  be completed.  Managers are concerned with \"checking the box\" for documentation rather than the true design being correct and reliable, but they will preach otherwise when the situation calls for it.\r\n\r\nIf you interview most likely the people you talk to were selected randomly and will not be your direct co-workers as you will be assigned a different role once you walk in the door.  It is not uncommon for them to shuffle around EEs to do ME work and MEs doing electrical products - reflects managements lack of interest in developing talent and more interested in developing \"engineering robots\" that can be tossed around to fight one fire to the next.\r\n\r\nExcessive meetings are used and scheduled to discuss every little detail which leaves little or no time for actual work to take place.  Not uncommon to be double or tipple booked for meetings during any given hour of the day.  If you get into a crunch expect daily or even hourly status update meetings with managers who add no value to the task at hand and only want to know when the issue will be resolved and why you are behind schedule - well maybe if you quit the hourly meetings we could get some work done and resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nNo ratings were select as can not give them any stars and would rate as negative if option was available."}, {"review_title": "Production Technician", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Production Technician in Kansas City, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay was good and good benefits.", "cons": "When I got hurt working at Harley-Davidson all I got was called upstairs by my supervisor who told me that if I cried anymore on the line I was going to get wrote up because I was disturbing the other workers.
