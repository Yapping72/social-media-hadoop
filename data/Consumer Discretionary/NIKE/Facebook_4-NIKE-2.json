I became full time (after leaving my contracting position and applying online) and being employed with Nike was almost identical to being a contractor. Of course there's perks like... insurance. And actually being treated a bit more like a human. BUT! The managers all have issues. They treat the ones that don't do any work like shining stars. People never went into work and the only ones that did show were the contractors. Until it was time to lay them off without notice of course. And the people that did work hard got scrutinized for the smallest things because they were seen as the ones keeping the whole facade together. Gossip was horrible. The managers went out of their way to subtlety intimidate their employees. Competition was ridiculous because...like mentioned...favoritism was every where. And nobody was held accountable when they'd miss work for say 2 weeks and come in on a random day. Because the managers like them. It was hell. Also the trainers almost seemed like they were paid to keep people away. All in all Nike (the one I was employed with. Memphis TN) is a group mindset thing.

Overall it comes down to the coaches and supervisors. If your apart of a great team, there is no reason to stress, but if there are some supervisors budding heads that can cause issues in workflow. It also can come down to personality, but I do believe Nike is a great place to have a career. You also have to be wiling to have patience with other employees, some employees can let there personal lives distract them from there jobs, which cause more of a rushed workflow.

It's exactly the same as it is for people outside of Nike trying to get in. And I'm told that promotions are not a thing at all unless you start managing people or something else that drastically changes your role. I work in the technology org and there's no wonder Nike is losing tech folks right and left with the new return to campus hybrid model. When I started a couple of years ago, working from home was not supported AT ALL. It took a pandemic to prove to Nike that office workers could be productive remotely. Thankfully that has spurred a plan to allow employees to work from home UP TO 2 days a week. LOL Good luck keeping your top talent with that decision. I am on a user experience team that focuses on employee-facing digital tools and we can't get a foothold in the SDLC. UX is in it's infant stages for digital employee experiences.
