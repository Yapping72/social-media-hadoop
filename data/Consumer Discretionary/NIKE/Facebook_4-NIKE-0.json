I made this request because, as a senior instructional designer and e-learning developer with over 15 years experience, I need to be able to exercise some level of independence based on my extensive background in the field. The hiring manager agreed with what I was seeking and raised no concerns with my request. I was quickly offered the position shortly afterward. \r\n\r\nHowever, once I was brought on board, not only did I not get a proper introduction to the rest of my team, but I was immediately thrown into a mountain of work without the appropriate amount of time needed to gather and review the necessary content from SMEs and properly develop the course material. This problem has persisted for several projects throughout my time here and has contributed to work-life balance issues. Whenever I inquire about the rationale for the aggressive timelines that management had set, I am simply ignored or told there is nothing that can be done. To make matters worse, management insists on micromanaging every design decision, which often leads to chaotic and rushed development. This is something I have never experienced anywhere else in my career.\r\n\r\nDue to management\u2019s poor project management skills, they end up sabotaging our team's ability to be creative, independent, and meet client deadlines. Even though management has admitted that they lack the technical skills needed to assist us with the development of online training, they refuse to rely on more knowledgeable team members to help inform more realistic project timelines based on their development experience. As a result, we have often let down several clients and have lost several ETWs due to being burned out or scared away. Meanwhile, the reason given to others for the high turnover in our team is typically not based on truth (e.g. health reasons, personal family matters). \r\n\r\nIf you are considering a position like this one in the organization (whether as an FTE or ETW), please take the time to ask critical questions to help you make an informed decision.

Don't trust the recruiting department. They will say anything to get you to come work for Nike. I fell for it and it cost me. The environment is unwelcoming. Management is cold. Team culture is toxic. I watched adults tattling on others just to get a gold star from the \"boss\". It was like working with a bunch of elitist toddlers. Throwing markers and screaming is a common practice among stressed-out team members. I used to think it was only specific to the team I was on until I moved to a couple of other teams. It is a Nike problem. Managers have no respect for personal time, and you'll be contacted nights and weekends. It feels like working for a company in the early 2000s. No direction and everyone is just throwing buzzwords around instead of trying to solve business problems. You'd think a company with Nike's reputation wouldn't have these types of issues. I watch managers take roll. I watched a manager drive his team into the ground, lay them off because they didn't deliver, and do it again to another team. At some point, Nike needs to purge the bad actors, but I have seen how it is a good ole boys club and they protect their own. I know this comes across as an axe to grind. However, I am only trying to save someone from the emotional and mental strain that Nike will have on you. I didn't believe some of the bad reviews, yet here I am writing one.

District managers allow store managers who are unqualified and bad at their jobs to continue to manage with little to no supervision. Very few channels to safely express concerns. Retaliation is a real possibility that upper management things could never happen. HR will take the store managers work above yours every time. The company puts an emphasis on work-life balance, but this only extends to WHQ employees. They expect store management to have open availability, work overtime at request, and will discriminate against you if you have children or outside restrictions that prevent you from working more than 40 hour when requested. As a regular store employee, they expected you to have extremely flexible availability in an effort to hire less employees but then at times would only be able to offer you 14 hours of work. You'd be unable to have a second job because of the availability requirements, but also wouldn't get enough hours to support yourself. Favoritism and nepotism are in abundance. Again - if you're in a store with good management, the experience will be wonderful. If you're in a store with poor management, it will be awful.\n\nThere's also rampant sexism among upper level leadership (territory managers, district managers, store managers).

Too many times, have managers/supervisors done less than the bare minimum for their direct reports. One example, CFE 1:1's have a standard of one every quarter, should take anywhere from 15-60 mins. One supervisor will make sure to get them done in a timely manner and actually has a conversation with their direct reports. And another will boast that they can get 15 CFE's done in 13 minutes... Literally less than 1 minute per person. It's extremely inconsistent and inconsiderate. To the point that the workers feel stifled and cut off at the knees at this company. There is no room for growth. And the supervisors do not make it a priority to develop their personnel. To top it off, if someone were to report or say something, they are retaliated against by having the limited opportunities removed from their path for growth.

I was granted short term disability and that was it. No parental leave, no salary top up, no pre-birth medical leave, no guarantee of return to position. I asked if I could take some PTO before giving birth and the response from HR was I could, but then that would lower the amount of time I could take for the baby. I was counting how leave I had by the days. Three months after my son was born and 3.5 months after I left Nike for a company that instantly granted me full maternity leave for 4.5 months at full pay, I was still getting notices of denial of benefits from Nike.\n\n - Repaying a sign on bonus and 8 months later still having back and forth to update taxes. Hence, the reminder that I should leave a review on GlassDoor so that others have a heads up on what they're walking into.\n\n - I'd lay out a long laundry list around management, HR, toxic work culture where one team routinely takes credit for another team's work and bogs the other team down with external consultants, but they are just all the small things that add up to where being denied maternity leave benefits was not unexpected.\n\nI had heard about Nike's poor treatment of mothers before joining and asked about it in the interview process. The responses I received were encouraging that they had completely revamped the process and added additional support. However, the support just isn't there. If you are pregnant at Nike and in the corporate headquarters, find the Slack channel where mothers are helping other mothers. The tricks folks are using are reminiscent of the 1980's, pre-FMLA.\n\nFor context, if Nike tried to treat me this way - there's no one I believe would be immune to a denial of benefits. This is not a company difference between hourly and salary or junior and senior. While there I also saw another very senior pregnant woman's role vanish when she went on leave. For men, to the best of my knowledge, benefits are 8 weeks and you have to work at Nike a full year before being eligible.
