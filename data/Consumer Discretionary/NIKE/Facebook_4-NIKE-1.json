Managers feel like coaches. Looser, more relaxed way of communication. \r\n*Discounts: Many people work in the retail sector at Nike Chicago for the numerous benefits it has to offer. A robust discount, access to employee-only raffles, opportunities to see and purchase product on day of release - this benefit is however subject to a great amount of abuse, as I've witnessed employees hide/steal product for their own gain. (See Cons)", "cons": "*Abusing Benefits: I frequently witnessed coworkers hiding \"high-heat\" products in backrooms for them to purchase at conclusion of shift. Many employees also were able to purchase product directly from \"Hash\" (returned or exchanged products that are meant to be mailed directly to another store), even though we were explicitly told that product in Hash could not be purchased by employees or customers. This part of the business seemed to operate on favoritism-if you were liked by certain members of the store, you were allowed to purchase from Hash. Employee raffles were also held frequently to give us the chance to win exclusive shoes, however, the raffles were always won by the same people. (I worked at the store for seven months and never won a single raffle; I witnessed others win at least 3 times in the course of one month). When a handful of people were caught for hiding \"high-heat\" product in the store for purchase later, none were reprimanded or terminated (they all worked at the store for at least 3 years). These people were generally favorited by others because they were \"good\" at their job. (In order to thrive at Nike Chicago, you have to be loud, obnoxious, and annoying. Leave any sense of professionalism at the door). If you don't have the energy of an NBA mascot, you aren't going to do very well. \r\n*Many employees, from management to coworkers, were very rude. I was astounded by the attitude some coworkers had, even upper management. Behavior that certainly wouldn't fly at another retailer.\r\n*Management is largely incompetent, for most of them, this is the only place they have really held a real job at, they are inexperienced in the world of business and communication. Because of that, management is largely mediocre, hard to communicate with, unreliable, and clique-y. \r\n*Like I said before, if you are serious about working here, leave any sense of professionalism at the door. They mistake professionalism for a lack of energy and interest. If you are really good at annoying people, or being a loudmouth, you will move up the ranks at this store very quickly. If you also like assaulting customers with asinine \"would-you-rather\" questions instead of asking them business-relevant questions, you will be offered a promotion within a few months.

Also, don't forget that you always be on the stress of: Here comes another \"Re-Alignment\" and Am I going to lose my job or not?? They will preach you about Networking, which means \"Brown Nosing\", so if you want to grow You must be able to manage the political BS. They will promise you promotions which may never happen and they will keep bringing new skills that you have to develop before getting to your next level, so they try to make you feel that you are never ready. The HR department overall is a joke and you can't trust them, they will preach you about the Non-Retaliation Policy or: If you see something, say something!! but if you say something and you face a situation, the company will take the opportunity in the next \"Re-Alignment\" to get rid of you once they don't want any type of conflicts and this is all about the business, so the part that is more relevant to them or has more to offer will always win, no matter what the case is, and if you face that, the same HR person that told you that was there for you and would help you, will be the one setting up your meeting when you get let go, so DON\"T trust HR. Despite that, there is a hands full of great leaders and I would NOT certainly include the new CEO - John D on this list, the only thing He cares is about himself, but what I can tell you is: YES, THERE IS LIFE OUTSIDE NIKE!!! and great opportunities out there, so if you ever decide to work for this company, make sure to take the advantage of learning as much as you can and always keep in mind that you are a passenger on this company and the end of your trip could be at anytime, so if that happens, you will be prepared and remember and memorize this saying: YOU ARE JUST A NUMBER!!!!
