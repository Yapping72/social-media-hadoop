They make a great quality product you can be proud of, and has a great culture with no limitations on access to senior leadership. \r\n\r\nThey have been great about recognizing talent and rewarding through career advancement and stretch assignments to learn and grow. Nike has so many opportunities that you can literally change career paths without leaving the company.  They are willing to allow you to move from something like operations to marketing or from production to finance if you can demonstrate that you are capable. I've now worked in three different countries, and have enjoyed all of them. \r\n\r\nNike makes a sincere effort to listen to its employees, and to be transparent about when and why things are done. Continually evaluate market compensation for each role and ensure they stay competitive.  It's also a giant company that's on a tear financially, with continued strong growth that is reflected in the stock valuation.", "cons": "Tough to get in.

It's a political power grab with some very disconnected leadership starting at the top of the IT organization and trickling down to middle management.

How much money is ENOUGH? The bigger they become, the more distance the top elite will become from the \"little man\", or the people who have been there for years.

It might seem strange, but it's true. I've worked for very few companies that actually place their corporate values dead center in the middle of the action. Also, unlike some companies, every Maxim is considered equally important. Some companies highlight one or two values as key and the rest as exposition. At Nike, that's not how it works. And, the Maxims are such that you can take them anywhere and find success. On the whole, employees really do try to live out the company values. This creates an engaging and lively work environment.\r\n\r\nIf you're a team player, like team sports, and are very social, Nike is a great place to work. The entire organization, from hiring and job evaluation practices, all the way through project assignments and resource management, rotates around the team concept. Project stakeholders are numerous and diverse, often stretching across the organization. Team building, team thinking, and team identity are de rigueur at Nike. The people on your team are not only coworkers but also friends (and even teammates on extracurricular basketball, soccer, flag football, or volleyball teams). Just as a your teammates in college became an essential part of your life in school, so your teammates at Nike will become an essential part of your daily life.\r\n\r\nThe benefits package the company offers employees is one of the best around. The Beaverton campus has two state-of-the-art workout and fitness buildings, offering every form of exercise and athletic recreation imaginable. There are two pubs and five restaurants, two convenience stores, and an employee store on campus. Company buildings are surrounded by running tracks, trails, soccer pitches, parks, football fields, beach volleyball courts, and more. The health, dental and vision plans provided are exhaustive. During the summer, WHQ even offers half-day Fridays as an incentive for employees to find the optimal work/life balance. And, they even have intramural sports team. And, if you have children, they provide two separate preschool facilities. In short, the only reason you would ever need to leave work is to grab a few hours of sleep.", "cons": "One of the drawbacks to a company culture so rooted in the team mentality is that nothing gets done without a meeting. Any decision, no matter how mundane, cannot be acted upon without at least one meeting. When you make everyone a stakeholder, it becomes very difficult to move quickly or to simply get anything done without a lot of leg work. Most managers spend their day at the office in meetings and their evenings at home working on everything else. Not only does this slow things down, it can create roadblocks where stakeholders (or those who feel they should be stakeholders) hold decisions or projects hostage.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the greatest \"Con\" about working at Nike. If you're no good at politics, then you won't go far in the company. Every stakeholder (and every person who thinks they are or wants to be) must be appeased to get anything done. If you move to quick, toes can be stepped on and you can find yourself on the outside-looking-in on your own project, as those with more company connections, better political skills, or more social savy push you out. This is the dark side of team-centric organizations. On a sports team there are hard numbers and clear ways of measuring impact, performance, and success. In the company cultural setting, these are more fuzzy and harder to define. Thusly, it comes down to perception. Be prepared to work more on company politics and your social reputation than on actual projects.\r\n\r\nRemember all those amazing benefits? Well, they come with a price. Nike pays significantly less than other companies of comparable size and wealth for the same jobs. It's not uncommon for HR or recruiting staff to inflate salary ranges by including all those great benefits in a quote or offer. The reason is simple. Nike believes that simply having the chance to work them should be reward enough. In some cases, I've seen as much as $10,000 difference in salaries. When this is combined with a work/life balance that is non-existent (because coworkers are expected to be friends in their personal life and all those meetings make for typically ten hour days), the convenience of all the great benefits offered in place loses much of its charm."}, {"review_title": "Great - with the right managers", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 May 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits for part-time over/full-time sales associates\r\nSabbatical after 10 years of full-time employment\r\nEmployee Discount\r\nBeing part of one of the largest and renowned companies in the world", "cons": "Overall, it depends on the management.

The power of the brand is also their achilles heel.\r\n\r\nI love the brand too, but Nike has worst corporate culture I've ever encountered, at any company.  No accountability anywhere.  Seniority always trumps talent.  Everyone talks a big game about teamwork, but it's every man for himself, all the way up the ladder as far as I could tell.  Zero investment in developing their people-- no HR presence anywhere.  Got a rotten manager? Abusive colleague? Too bad, there's nobody to help you.  I never even had an HR person in my division.  Giant high school popularity contest, zero meritocracy.  Multiple groups with the same assignments and charter will work in silos for months, even years, without knowing about each other.  When they find out about each other, it devolves into Game of Thrones/Hunger Games.  Back stabbing, idea stealing, and double-crossing are all common practice in these scenarios; I saw it at very high levels of the company, too.  It's a flat out organizational disaster with a flaky day-to-day culture: show up late (or not at all) to meetings, everything gets a green light/thumbs up face to face but nobody backs up their word when it comes to budgeting or anything else that requires an actual commitment.  Senior leadership stays loyal to terrible under-performers who are allowed to waste millions of dollars and ruin multiple careers beneath them because they've \"been at Nike since the early days.\"  I personally worked inside a gigantic \"bozo explosion\" that worked exactly the way Jobs described it: B players hiring C players hiring D and F players, all the way down the line.  These same clowns then 'fail up' into positions of higher and higher salary with less and less accountability because nobody wants to have tough conversations or real talk.  Basically it's a giant playground run by the children who keep their friends in cushy, undeserved roles while great talent is squandered beneath them and eventually leaves for other companies.  And no, I'm not generalizing my own path-- in my first 2 years I watch a list of all-stars quit in disgust.  Nike didn't care.  They didn't even bother with exit interviews.

Noticed that they deceive workers often, promising they will go home early (meaning 10pm instead of 12am) which seemingly never happens.

However, the management at the factory store was horrible!!! If you live in KY I strongly advise you not to work at the  Nike Outlet in Simpsonville, unless they get new management. There is a lot favoritism and disrespect from management, they do not value their employees. Because of the poor leadership, many athletes quit and managers left. You were not able to get weekends off unless you requested them off and often times your request were denied because the store was under staffed. It was unfortunate such a great brand had horrible management at thier factory store."}, {"review_title": "Stay away from their retail.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 May 2019", "job_title": "Visual Athlete in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "meeting new people. friendships. lovely coworkers. events. discounts.", "cons": "favoritism. lack of morals. people quitting every week. upper management lacked actual management skills.  if working on the retail side, you will feel very disrespected and overworked. almost every other week i was set up to work a weeks worth of overnight shifts. they never cared that i was in school either. insurance here is not that great either. they expect you to put nike first. if something happened to come up, or if you had class or other conflicts they'd expect you to put nike before anything else. i could hardly ever flex my schedule if i had to go to a doctors appointment. i guess my health was not important to them."}, {"review_title": "Great Company But Store Management Sucks!", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Floor Athlete in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Honestly, Nike is a great company outside of the store.

People are good to work with as well, might make lifetime friends.", "cons": "Any shift over 5hrs requires you take a 1 hour break. Which is stupid b/c you are there longer.
