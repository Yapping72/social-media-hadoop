A big reason is management is terrible. It really felt that they needed a VP of the VP's. It was that ridiculous with management overlap.

The supervisors don't follow up with line worker requests and don't communicate with leads. As a result of this, they end up mixing orders and the lines suffer because of it. \r\n            Managers will constantly remind line workers to let them know if something is wrong with a machine, and when something is wrong they tell them to just wait and bear with it until a break-time when they are willing to shut off a line to fix it. There are multiple occasions I can remember when someone mentioned something wrong with a part and they told them to wait til break, when the parts gave out the lines ended up going down for 2-6 hours. \r\n            Supervisors often forget things that they tell people they will do, and as a result the communication is poor. For instance, I was supposed to get reviewed after my first-third-and sixth month of employment so I could see what areas I was doing well in and what areas I could improve on, but I never saw those. Even after asking my supervisor the answer was always, \"yeah we'll get to that soon.\" \r\n             The work is horribly inefficient, and if there are any solutions to speeding up the process that cost anything, the requests will get denied. This and there are plenty of \"quality of life\" changes to the lines that are plain out stupid, a waste of company resources, and a waste of time. There was a day when my line was down and I had nothing to do, so a coworker and I spent 3 hours putting colored duct tape onto a table. This of course was a better alternative to just sitting there, as our line manager told us to not leave the area because we would be up and running soon.\r\n              To continue on the lack of efficiency, there is also incredible amounts of bias. I hope you don't plan on getting promoted because unless you know the Supervisors personally, you're going to have to work there for a long time to get one. Since promotions are time based, it's only about how long you've worked there, not how good of a worker you are. Along with this, supervisors will promote people for no reason other than the fact that they know them. \r\n              If you need a job, Air MI is an okay place to work, but ultimately I just wouldn't apply.

Additionally, there is a genuine effort to ensure that diversity is honored and developed. Managers receive extensive ongoing training in management coaching and leadership. Due to Nike's extremely competitive hiring process (see below for downside), it is often the case that the employees skilled enough to be hired are also a  joy/fun to work around.  Good communication skills and team orientation meaning.. get along well with others, go above and beyond at all times, avoid complaining, and be flexible for whatever new process, role, or workload is added to your plate at a moment's notice) are prerequisites for getting hired on.\r\n A comfortable safe work environment is provided to all employees. Any reports of mistreatment are investigated and handled immediately. Nike has a variety of network organizations to support and encourage understanding of a variety of minority groups including the gay and lesbian community. \r\n\r\nNike encourages community involvement in a way that few if any other companies can match. In addition to matching donations to non profits dollar for dollar, the company supports employees donating their time in the community by paying the employees wages while they volunteer. \r\n\r\nWage pay is average to the low end of the average , however, when benefits are considered the package offered is very competitive.

It is not uncommon for management to be asked to interview candidates who are related or acquainted (often ridiculously remotely) to senior leaders with little regard to their qualifications. Note: Managers are never told they have to hire anyone. They are merely encouraged to consider a specific candidate.  A published internal poll on Nike's intranet site a couple of years ago revealed that a significant number of current employees acknowledged they got their first Nike job due to networking and knowing the right people. \r\n\r\nNike's pay for performance system doesn't always reward performance in the way it was designed. HR monitors the process throughout the year and asks managers for prelimimary performance ratings for teams of employees to gauge if the distribution of ratings ensuring that it looks to be within the normal range. While managers and employees alike are assured that no forced ratings occur, managers are asked to \"look again\" if too many good ratings or not enough less than average ratings are being projected. Supervisors who question the process are seen as not being good/skilled managers and may be asked to take additional \"coaching\" training to ensure they understand that the process is not forced but \"randomly\" falls in a certain distribution pattern.\r\n\r\nManagers are frequently hired for their specific subject matter expertise and then trained to be supervisors. It isn't uncommon in some areas of the company for managers to handle a full workload and also be managers as a part of their job. As a result, the quality of the manager you may be asked to  work for may depend on how much previous supervisory experience they come into their job with. In Nike's defense, they are aware of this and place a large amount of time, money, and energy to ensure that all manager's have a minimum core skill level soon after being promoted into any roles that involve direct reports.

Consequently, they are seen as outcast and people don't even acknoledge their existence when they need help performing a team project.

Since many of the people you will meet st Nike are from the same \"current\" school, they will form cliques and act just like they were misfits or brats at \"school\". These kids have no work ethics. You will hear, see a lot of gossiping from such people. These kind of people won't hesitate to backstab you in front of your leads and coaches because you simply don't share the same views. The more mature and stable ones (21+) are great to be around with. Sometimes, you will be surprised see leads and coached act like high school brats and immature college or graduate people. It happens... Rather, you need to realize that you will experience high school and freshman college mentality in your store and that's a fact. Unless, you have the perfect personas all engulf in you store. Even the perfect High school in \"high school musical\" showed cliques, favoritism, and backstabing are a regular thing even in the best schools. And A Nike store (factory or town) is like a big school where the only difference is you get paid. With this in mind, you will be able to endure since you get paid to deal with chronic psychos and bipolar people. Some of your coaches will be really immature. They will have their bad days and will direct that negative energy to coworkers who haven't done anything wrong. And if a coach or lead doesn't like you, it will be hard for you to move up or be protected against those who don't and will never like you (yeah this happens too, and for no reasons).

You'll love coming to work to see your co-workers and some consumers make your day when you're able to talk to them on slow days. Management can definitely improve on deferring from favoritism and only picking on those who are not. They can also work on having the leads actually contribute to the sales floor and not just micromanage or walking around ordering people to do minimal tasks they're capable of. They're big on receiving feedback referred to as pulse shout outs which are then read out loud the following day so make sure you make an effort to give good service and get recognized by the consumer filling that survey out. They also do tend to use gift cards and food or additions to the break room as incentives to win contests such as being the store that sells the most gift cards during holiday season or who can keep up perfect attendance meaning punch in on time and  be on the floor ready on time. This is a great job for students and people who are hesitant on retail because I found this retail job to be less strenuous than what I heard most retail jobs are and a decent pay. You get to say you work for NIKE which is a great accomplishment seeing their applications and interview hiring process is competitive.", "cons": "Again, favoritism plays a big role depending on which store you are at. As much as they emphasize on premium service, they are always either out of sizes or don't sell the merchandise consumers come in. You'll get reprimanded by the coaches or leads if you come in with dirty sneakers, not the right uniform or if you're not in the zone you're assigned. Really hard to grow and stand out in retail if you want to grow within the company. Again, it's about favoritism over professionalism in some stores.

Extremely underutilized based on background and experience. Many employees have the ability to contribute more, many have expressed the desire too and often the answer is to stay within your area and continue operating, the opportunities will come. \r\n2. I have been told multiple times to \"sit and keep my mouth shut\" during a meeting (Female typically in all male meetings). \r\n3. Leadership values \"Thought Leaders\" over \"People Leaders\" \u2013 In my experience this has then turned into \"thought only\" conversations taking place only at the senior management level but never includes those that actually DO the work or can operationalize said \"thought\" strategy. Sr. Directors and VPs are more concerned with pruning each other\u2019s feathers and networking with each other, then getting any actual work done. \r\n4. Lack of promotion of female leaders: Often excuse given is that a specific female acts too aggressive and therefore is passed over for promotion (this is when a male counter-part can say the exact same thing but been seen as a strong leader). I see this occur on a weekly basis. \r\n5. General lack of leadership - I have been in my role about 18 months at the Director level and I have yet to have any leadership in regards to my career, focus or vision of my team, etc. even after multiple attempts to meet with many leaders across the organization to seek guidance. \r\n6. \"Nike Knowledge\" (aka time at Nike) is valued above any outside perspective or experience any new employees may bring to the table. \r\n7. Navigating the \u201cMatrix\u201d organization is seen as a badge of honor, not as excuse for not getting work done, that it is. Many large companies have similar matrix type organizations and can move work forward with small teams driving decisions. \r\n8. Over use of Power Point! Every form of communication is put in power point, it is like the computers at Nike have no other applications installed. I was presenting a calendar in one meeting and I was told by the VP \u201cI will look at it when it is in power point\u201d. I looked at him like he had grown two heads, but he was serious. They want to pay someone at my level, a heathy six figure salary, to copy my completely formatted calendar from Excel to PowerPoint. This is my everyday, if you come to work at Nike, you will LIVE in PowerPoint. No one can actually READ anything here (that is presented in a word document), it has to be served up in a beautiful power point that \u201cgets to the point\u201d, complete with graphics and animation."}, {"review_title": "Great Company!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 May 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits are amazing and you really can't help wanting to become a better athlete being in the sportswear field.

I don't know what went down, but the fact that the company is now going to open up an anonymous hotline for complaints and is promising some soul-searching about the culture there indicates to me that upper management is aware of a company-wide issue -- one that's pervasive, systemic, and stretches far beyond the C-Suite. \r\n\r\nGood. It's about time. \r\n\r\nNike HQ is toxic for women. It has been for a long time. And not in the ways that are easily identifiable -- not everyone is getting Matt Lauer'ed or brushing off lewd comments at an office happy hour. It's far more insidious than that-- and it's not just the entitled, overpaid white men who are responsible. \r\n\r\nHere are some ways the environment is toxic for women: \r\n\r\n- Getting ignored, marginalized or talked over when trying to present in a meeting. (The standard-issue white male Senior Director will be checking his phone, trust me). \r\n\r\nToxic. \r\n\r\n- Leaving early to pick up a sick baby at daycare, feeling the resentment of the rest of your team (particularly childless women) following you out the door. \r\n\r\nToxic. \r\n\r\n- Being passed over for promotions as a woman, doomed to tread water in middle-manager-land forever, because you've been deemed either too aggressive or not committed enough because you leave early to pick up said sick baby (see above). \r\n\r\nToxic. \r\n\r\n- Checking your email at 3 a.m. because you're up and dealing with a kid with an ear infection, only to discover a brusque, frustrated note from your boss sent at 11:53 pm asking why you haven't turned in a project yet. \r\n\r\nToxic. \r\n\r\n- Standing around at an office function, watching the lads and bros (all Senior Directors) shmooze with the VP as you stand off with the other women (managers, \"specialists\") and wait your turn to try and make an impression on said VP  (white, male, usually British) and hope he remembers your name. \r\n\r\nToxic.\r\n\r\nLook - some of this probably sounds like standard corporate-America griping, and perhaps it is. But having worked for other Fortune 500 companies, I can tell you that the environment at Nike is unique. Politics, backstabbing, strict adherence to hierarchical, patriarchal norms, and frat-boy/lad culture all conspire to make it a fairly awful place for women, particularly moms. The only women I know who ever made it up the ranks (a double-edged sword, as the job will then consume your every waking moment) are the ones who acted like men to get there -- swaggering about, doling out sports-talk, ingratiating themselves with the right people while stepping on others to get up the ladder, and routinely placing work as the highest priority over family time and/or anything else. \r\n\r\nOf all the painful circumstances of working there, the woman-on-woman warfare was the worst. Women at Nike HQ are forced to squabble, scheme and bully each other to fight for position and influence at a company that gives out precious little of either.\r\n\r\nToxic. \r\n\r\nI'll leave it at that. #TimesUp, Nike, and not a moment too soon."}, {"review_title": "Athlete", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 May 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great discount.

The CIS leadership had a multi-year plan to mature the security program and they squandered it through a combination of mismanagement and old fashioned incompetence, where form is more important than function. \r\n\r\nFor example, most companies build out processes for how technology will be used, but in CIS it is opposite - technology is purchased without a viable plan for how it will be used. CIS leadership squandered an amazing opportunity to build a top-notch cybersecurity program through bad management hires, political infighting, and a complete lack of any actionable plan to mature the program (beyond a shopping list of technologies they wanted to buy). Instead of maturing the existing processes and getting the new technology working, more tools were purchased... this added to frustrated engineers and analysts, since the CIS leadership focused on checking off boxes on their shopping list of new technologies and not on how the technology was actually being used. This was not always the case, but more often than not the rollouts did not focus on operationalizing the tools beyond go live. This is simply due to poor management and a lack of accountability for making bad operational decisions. It should be no surprise that this is what happens when you hire non-technical people into technology leadership roles.\r\n\r\nMost disheartening was seeing how the NIKE Maxims were quoted repeatedly as guiding principles within CIS. However, in reality, the CIS leadership team ran in complete opposition \u2013 everything was lip service to doing the right thing. On the corporate side, everyone is expected to welcome new or challenging ideas, quickly evolving to new realities, and treat people with respect. Within CIS, the focus is to maintain the status quo and not to rock the boat. If you step out of line, you are listed as a trouble maker by the CIS leadership team. \r\n\r\nSuch a waste.

This was to support a huge iniative to bring innovation, advancement and a \"fresh\" culture into Nike IT.\r\n\r\nWith this big push (e.g., Blackhat, etc.) they attempted to hire in external experts and did a good job - initially.  However, Nike over promised and under delivered on all their verbal promises during the employment phases.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nYou would think that if the \"Nike Lifers\" couldn't deliver in 25yrs yet the external experts delivered in two the Board of Directors would take note.  This group of individuals not only changed the entire company (IT) around, they fixed a multitude of contractual, vendor relationships, IT production and IT security problems - that existed for decades!\r\n\r\nWith such a dramatic and noticeable turn around in 2-3 yrs (vs. 25yrs) you would think the Nike board would praise and promote the external experts.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Nike Lifers have targeted all the external talent and are gradually removing them from employment.  Internal efforts revolved around slander, defamation, creating mock-turmoil, etc.\r\n\r\nRecruiters:\r\nExternal recruiters fully admit to hire someone at Nike, in the IT field, is a \"daunting task\".  Nike does not have a good reputation and they savage industry experts.\r\n\r\nPersonal Note:\r\nThis was one of the worse career decisions I have ever made for me and my family.  I was told I could promote change, make a difference that there was nothing here \"a blank slate\" - which was very true.  But once I started to innovate and make change the \"Lifers-fangs\" came out and the internal battle lines were drawn. I lost and so did my family.\r\n\r\nI wish someone would have wrote this on GD before I got employed.\r\n\r\nBe warned!!!!!\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n- Nike lifers are threatened by outsiders\r\n\r\n- If you are over 40yrs old forget long term employment\r\n\r\n- IT Salary is below industry standards\r\n\r\n- Few people of color are actually employed at Nike (especially in executive positions)\r\n\r\n- Very high tech talent turn over rate w/in technology divisions \r\n\r\n- Senior Managers in IT are non-technical bureaucrats\r\n\r\n- Little (internal) career advancement opportunities for IT Pros\r\n\r\n- No outside career enrichment opportunities (e.g., training, speaking engagements, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Do not adhere to the Nike's \"11 Maxims\" (e.g., Evolve Immediately, Do the Right Thing, Simplify and Go, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Beware of the \"Dutch Mafia\" \r\n(Dutch hired in the '90s have evolved into an interconnected political powerhouse that protect each other. They will commit \"career-assassinations\" against anyone and all outsiders regardless of expertise to protect themselves and their jobs.)\r\n\r\n- Management retribution is common-place"}, {"review_title": "Retail Sales Associate", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Oct 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Hooks you up with Swag. 2 free bottoms and a free pair of shoes every 6 months.

With all due respect to the General Manager at Nike IHM, Brett Gantz. For the short duration, I've encountered Brett Gantz an outstanding General Manager who cares very much of his employees and Nike company. There are a few supervisors and PMOs have great potential on day shift (D1). Unfortunately, the other 99% offset the rest. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, not once received any kind of welcome and/or kindly greeting. That sets a negative environment to any newcomers. I've never experienced from any other company that showed lack of cordiality and hospitableness towards an employee. \r\n\r\nSecond, lack of communication and teamwork from co-workers within the cell. It's all about secrecy, whispering, and/or \"tattle-tale\" one another to gain browning points form either immediate supervisors or PMOs. \r\n\r\nThird, unnecessary and unprepared meetings from a specific PMO with no skilled facilitation and clarity. In general, meeting purposes are clear, participants are prepared, conversation is dynamic, and the meeting ends promptly, with next steps defined and confirmed among all participants. The meeting may be pleasant, and even fun, and there may exist an enjoyable camaraderie amongst participants. But the meeting is clearly about moving forward the work of the day and is energized by the preparation and clear-focus of its participants.\r\n\r\nIn closure, for a striving and well-organized giant business, Nike IHM have a long tedious road ahead of them to improve their quality of employees. However, this doesn't reflected any negative reviews towards Nike IHM employees at St. Charles, MO.
