I was told I needed to do this while on the clock. I worked nights and weekends, usual time off for those people I needed to meet with. So, that was a barrier. Meanwhile, people left and right who have been there for well over 7-10 years are getting promoted.

Long story short, unless you know someone or have been there for a while, don\u2019t expect to be moved up or hired to the corporate level. Go on LinkedIn and see for yourself - internal promotes announce their promotion all the time.
