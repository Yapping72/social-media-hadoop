On one lake, if they hear from a trusted source that lightning is close enough to be dangerous, they will shut down the lake. On another lake, they at least trust the Lake Patrol employees enough that they can call out how many seconds away they see a lightning strike, and that is taken under advisement. In one area, if an employee who is not a supervisor calls a count, they can face punishment. My spouse works on this lake where punishment can be doled out for trying to contribute to the safety of employees and customers, and she works in the Lake Patrol position; she is on a boat, on the lake. Every day during the summer, I have that nagging question in the back of my head: Will my wife be allowed to make it off the water today before lightning strikes? Will she come home?

It's entire doctrine is based on whether that employee is good or evil, that they had either protagonised or antagonised its totalitarian culture.\r\n\r\nSimilar to those of a despot government, it's based on control, low transparency, therefore a dishonest and exclusive supply chain and no financial integrity at their very own right.
