I found myself running into massive walls left and right when trying to address problems with the way things were being done. The phrase \"That's not the Disney way\" is thrown around a lot. Sure Disney has been around and what they've been doing seems to work, but they're not innovating or moving. They're stagnant and that's not good. They like to silo people to the point I had no idea what my other team mates were doing because they don't encourage communication and they sure as heck don't care much about team morale.\r\n\r\nThey've got several legal and technological departments, a moving set of standards that are essentially a la carte. Don't like a policy put out by infosec? That's fine! Just ignore it! Bring up an issue to have it addressed by leadership? Your immediate leaders will listen (which is good!) Once you're past director level they are so removed from everything that they don't care as long as they get them bonuses. This means at any point in time millions are being wasted on aging technology that needs to be updated but won't be because of \"reasons\".\r\n\r\nThat brings us full circle to some of the other issues. The way Disney has handled this pandemic was bad at the best. People are/were on indefinite furloughs and teams are being ground to dust because executive leadership hasn't ever worked with a team that doe thing X so they don't know what to do with them and instead of learn they do the microsoft thing of Embrace, Extend, Extinguish.

There are entrenched figures with tight interpersonal bonds, their favorite people seem to snap up the lion's share of the raise money year after year, and the degree to which you're expected to put out 'extras' if you want a promotion (big raises really only happen with a formal promotion here along a pretty well-defined title hierarchy) is high enough as to not be commensurate with what the promotion will actually bring you. Enough long-timers here discuss year-over-year raise rates enough to know over-achievers here still aren't getting what they could elsewhere, but at the same time management is happy to let you coast and still get you at a cheaper and cheaper rate each year as the local tech market salaries grow faster. As a huge company with never-ending options that moves at it's own pace, they kind of know they hold all the cards with a long-term full time employee.\r\n\r\nAll in all it's not a terrible place to work. Just disappointing after several years here. Self-advocacy here is almost pointless and I should have moved on after about 2 years (get the name and experience on the resume, better your career elsewhere)."}, {"review_title": "Coworkers are family", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Lifeguard", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Close coworkers and upper management", "cons": "Low pay and not great hours"}, {"review_title": "Great!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Retail Sales Associate in Brea, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "so great so great great!", "cons": "no cons no cons at all"}, {"review_title": "Disney CM", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Attractions Cast Member", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work environment and benefits", "cons": "Employees are expendable which lowers morale."}, {"review_title": "Disney+ is great", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Director, Data Engineering in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place if you love Scala.", "cons": "Big company, Lots of teams to navigate."}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Analyst in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "benefits, pay, location, friends, work", "cons": "people, pay, location, hours, office"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Wholesale in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Job security, great culture and people", "cons": "Little room to grow and not sure how they select who\u2019s promoted."}], [{"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits are really good, and park tickets", "cons": "Pay is a con especially in New York City"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Attractions Host in Anaheim, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "of course all of the perks", "cons": "low amount of hours sometimes"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "20 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Accountant in Indianapolis, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work environment.

As a matter of fact, any process consistency that we had was lost after the reorganization along with the best people in the office. There was an over-reliance on staff augmentation which led to a revolving door of engineers and project managers. Converting from a contractor to staff was a humiliating and time consuming effort. When the pandemic started and there were understandably layoffs. The pandemic, however, provided cover for leadership to do what was already happening for months -Through strategic layoffs, the Seattle office was further hollowed out with no significant leadership, or administrative support. Everything was guided from Bristol, CT. This was extremely poignant because at town hall meeting, a representative from leadership looked directly into the camera and addressed Seattle stating in no uncertain terms, that the Seattle office was not going to close, it was in fact going to receive investment and grow. We all understand that times are uncertain, leadership could have stepped up at that moment, but was silent."}], [{"review_title": "Great place to work for extra money!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "24 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Cast Member in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent benefits!
