Majority of your co-workers are Hatians who cannot speak the English language or speak very poor English which make things difficult. A lot of Hatians people like to self isolate themselves from other cultures so it is common to see the Hatians talking with their own only and not hanging out with the other cultures which leads to many problems that the company is current facing. Very racist culture this company has among the cast members. And the same thing for the Hispanic people. Their is not unity with your fellow cast members here.

The nature of the type of guests we get means that many people genuinely believe in the magic that Disney is selling. Because of this you are able to connect in a different way than in some other hospitality jobs. There is a true emotional connection to the characters and the environment. In terms of benefits the company does offer tuition reimbursement for leaders on a class by class basis, and for hourly cast members there is the aspire program. Cast members also get free entrances into the parks. However, even before Covid there were a lot of block out dates. Now with Covid there are even more, so this really shouldn\u2019t be a deciding factor.", "cons": "Once again, it absolutely depends on your location. I worked at several different locations and overall the first ones were amazing. However, my last location was absolutely terrible. There was absolutely no work life balance, it was a very toxic and very abusive work environment, there was no support for managers from upper leader ship. Quite literally everyone at that location was stressed out of their mind. It was not uncommon to see leaders crying in their cars or in their offices. Leader shifts are a minimum of 10 hours but usually more. So even though you are being paid for 40 hours, expect to work at least 55+. Growth and advancement potential is once again based on your location. Many locations are so understaffed that there is very little mentorship possible. The company itself does have many different programs/clubs that cast members can join to help network, but trying to find time to actually do this is next to impossible. There is a huge culture of overworking and it is very normalized. You are look down on if you do not willingly give extra all the time. There are many stories of Directors and other leaders who started at the bottom and work their way up, but many times you\u2019ll find that they are the absolute worst leaders. They were amazing at their jobs in an hourly sense but have no idea how to be good leaders and instead continue to perpetuate extremely toxic environments.\r\nIn terms of entrances to the parks, especially now with Covid, it is extremely challenging for cast members to get in if they are not fully blocked out all together.People genuinely want to work hard for this company. But they do not want to be taken advantage of or abused any longer. A shift in the culture needs to happen. People want to feel that they are being invested in just as they are investing in the company.\r\n\r\nIf you speak another language, do not let anybody know. Disney does not pay any type of differential for this skill and they will take advantage of you for it. There is a language line that Disney pays for the cast members to use, but once it is found out that you are a native speaker, you will get more work and not be compensated fairly for it."}, {"review_title": "Excellent company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Employee in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Disney bring magic to people", "cons": "There\u2019s nothing I want to say about it"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work at", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Sales Representative in Anaheim, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great working environment and good benefits.", "cons": "Need some internal experiences to find the right person to get the answer as it is a big organization."}, {"review_title": "Good place to be", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Food Service Worker", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits are amazing lots of opportunities", "cons": "Hard to get full time"}], [{"review_title": "Bad", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Cashier", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits are good and pay", "cons": "But they don\u2019t treat there cast members right they treat that trash.

I have never felt less like a human being than when working for Disney. Working at Disney is a constant reminder that you are nothing more than a number and your needs are the last thing on the company's list of priorities (unless it's a liability). I have never cried at work until I got this job. I have never been legitimately screamed at by another adult until I got this job. After 3 years and a college program with Disney I am nothing but let down. My love for Disney was once so strong and now it is dead. \r\n\r\nThe Disney look guidelines have been improved a lot recently as we are allowed to show tattoos and more nail polish colors, but they are still extremely strict and are quite ambiguous which means your management team can choose to make your life easy or hard. In my experience I have been singled out and yelled at countlessly on my \"unnatural\" brown roots growing back from my heavily highlighted hair, which I never let grow past half an inch. I was told I needed to die my hair all one color and never show any signs of root growth or I would risk being fired from the company. \r\n\r\nContacting anyone including managers, HR, or casting is made extremely difficult. usually, you have to wait on hold for 30+ minutes or your management never contacts you altogether. If you have questions or concerns do not expect them to be addressed easily. \r\n\r\nExpect to work relentless hours, sometimes being scheduled 14 hours or more for one shift with little regard to your schedule the previous or next day. This means you could be scheduled until 2 am and have a morning shift the next day and Disney would not bat an eye. Furthermore, you are not garunteed a fixed schedule so your days are changing week to week. On the flip side, if you are part time you are not garaunteed any hours and you could be left unscheduled for months on end with absolutely no warning. Technically you can also be \"force-extended\" at work which means when your shift is over you are required to stay longer (could be hours) without any prior notice because the staff is short. All of these senarios have happened to me and to many others that I know. \r\n\r\nOn the park operation level it is nearly impossible to move up in the company, especially to anything substancial. Disney is constantly hiring managers from outside or from professional internships. I know many cast members whose career goal is to move up within the company and after 5+ years of work they have barely recieved any kind promotion.\r\n\r\nIf you do not like your role it takes an entire year to be eligable to transfer to something new and that is not garaunteed. You also need to maintain a near perfect record card for this to happen, which can be difficult considering if you clock in even 1 second late you will be pointed. In addition, there are no sick days so if you need to stay home you will be pointed regardless of reasoning. \r\n \r\nBackstage break rooms in some locations are absolutely disgusting I have seen the biggest roaches in these areas. There is limited lunch options offered on site and in my experience there is never more than a 45 minute break depending on shift length and location, which means leaving work for a lunch run is impossible so prepare to bring your own. \r\n\r\nThe list goes on."}, {"review_title": "Moving Ahead best review available", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "28 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Project Manager in Huntington Beach, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Employee benefits\r\nLeadership is above average\r\nSupport Teams", "cons": "24/7 responsibilities\r\nShort Staffed\r\nToo many highly paid Executive"}, {"review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "18 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They offers many benefits outside of normal", "cons": "When you are in Sr Management, your job is always at risk of being lost due to new person coming in and trying to make their mark by getting rid of old"}, {"review_title": "Decent perks, tiring work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Steward", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Got to go to the parks for free", "cons": "Didn't work with school schedule"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Marketing", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good people in the company", "cons": "Very competitive atmosphere and hard to get corporate jobs"}, {"review_title": "It\u2019s not all that it cracked up to be", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Lifeguard in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get into the parks for free!
