It is important to note that the Studio works and operates very different than other divisions. So, if you don't like one division, you may be happier in another division. \r\n\r\n1. You can't beat the IP The Walt Disney Company has.\r\n2.  Pay and benefits (monetary) are decent if you are Sr. Manager and above. (But still not comparable to other large organizations such as Amazon, Google, etc.", "cons": "1. Pay lots of $$ to hire a majority of their workforce via Accenture or EY, eventhough they end up botching projects, overpromising, under delivering, and leave the studio with the bag. All the while ignoring their own workforce employees, who actually have a vested interest in the business.\r\n2. Don't bother to foster growth and learning amongst employees. Culture fosters apathy and resentment and complacency.\r\n2. Do not attempt to bring in new ideas, or you will be labeled an outlier or disruptor. Most of the people who actually care and want to bring in good ideas often get alienated or worse, get put on terrible projects until they can no longer bear it.\r\n3. Upward mobility is nearly impossible. The title you come in with is most likely the title you will keep. (Although their is no problem increasing workload while cutting staff)\r\n4. The consensus is that in order to move up.. you have to first move out. So, I've decided to move on. Perhaps I'll be back another day.\r\n5. Many executives of Director and above are complacent. They get large perks to stay but neglect to foster the growth of their teams, or to continue to grow, be innovative or work on making the culture the \"Disney\" culture that the public sees.\r\n6. Very political. Restating what a previous employee said because it rings true, \"Very heavy office politics come into play, and your opportunities for advancement are based largely on who you rub elbows with rather than the merit of your work. At the Director level and above, nepotism is rampant, you eventually find out that most of the heavy hitters come from the same companies. \"\r\n7. Very disorganized and siloed because of competing priorities (and nasty politics). There is no one clear voice, or mission. Although it is written on paper and in an email, the executives nor the staff truly honor it. So, it gets passed as just fluff.\r\n8. Executives talk the talk. But don't walk the walk. Meaning, they talk about making progress, being innovative, having a great culture, providing and fostering growth. Yet, when tough decisions need to be made - they hide behind middle management. If all goes well, the executives win. If not, the executives don't own the responsibility and the middle manager loses his credibility or worse yet, his/her job.\r\n9. Behind closed doors, females are undercut and looked down upon for \"being too nice\". If you are not a part of the \"boys\" club, forget it. \r\n10. If you have a family and are a mother, forget it (especially if you are Female). Expect to be looked down upon from most of the male (and oddly enough single female) executives. They expect you to work the same way as your single counterpart, otherwise, your big projects get taken away, and like #2, you get put on horrible projects until you are forced to leave.\r\n11. HR is corrupt in Disney Studio. There have been many complaints of harassment from quite a few females and most have fallen on deaf ears, ignored, or again #2.

For single guys reading this, there is also a good amount of attractive girls and as long as eye candy isn't a negative distraction for you personally this can be a good thing.\r\n\r\nReally nice campus and people, not a lot of negatives I can say about Disney. If you are interviewing with them or was offered a position...take it. Unless you have an established history of working with the world's largest companies and would need to do more research to see how Disney stacks up against them, then this will be an immediate \"pro\" that you will feel when it comes to the doors it opens if you are ever in a position where you have to look elsewhere for employment, and with all the constant layoffs that seem to be quarterly from my experience having the Disney name on your resume never hurts. Although most websites seem to say every 6 months, don't count on it being that long between layoffs. I don't mark the dates of every layoff we had since I started, to me it felt pretty much seasonal.", "cons": "What seems to be quarterly/semi-annual layoffs is huge. I'm not sure if this is a coincidence but this also lead in some areas and to some degree a negative and delusional environment at times.\r\n\r\nNegative in the sense that certain people seem to be so afraid of...whatever they are afraid of that they are willing to lie and throw others under the bus (via reasonable-doubt), than to take responsibility or get things done. Not to name names or specific projects but there was one example where team A failed to communicate something to team B and team B giving team A a failing grade on something they were asked to evaluate. This mis-communication was minor and affected little to nothing since the task would have been needed down the road when team A was actually ready for it, but the attitude in the resolving meeting was team A's manager coming in hot trying to put the blame on team B, team B correcting them and calmly explaining how there was no actual issue and that the work in question would simply be done when team A felt they were ready, then team A feeling relief and comfort once given the reality of the situation and assured that it wasn't a big deal or would be a negative mark on their team.\r\n\r\nTo help paint a better picture without naming names or projects, imagine a manager coming into a meeting visibly upset and on fire, tries to put the blame on team B, have team B easily and quickly shut this attempt down, then turns to his/her team and literally walks down the line trying to get someone to fall on their sword for a non-existent problem so that they take the blame (and thus gets it put on their performance review, which ultimately means you'll face losing your job depending on your manager's personal feelings about you), just to have the other side of the table point out that the \"issue\" is such a minor thing that no one was concerned about and simply wasn't a big deal. At that point the fired up manager, which was at fault for the actual miscommunication, shows a sigh of relief akin to someone about to lose their home to not paying their mortgage that just won the lottery. That is the type of \"I will do anything to protect myself from admitting fault, even when the issue is simply in my head and is not a real thing, or is a real thing but not a big deal\" that you might see. Others include using reasonable-doubt strats to flat out lie to put another person under the bus, even if that person never did what was said or the person saying it simply having no idea what they are talking about. And when this is proven or shown, don't expect it to matter if your manager doesn't seem to like or respect you anyway. Yes this seems suspect and sketchy but once you realize HR's job is to protect the company rather than deal with managers and their suspicious on-going behaviors, which is the nicest way I can put it, then you can't be surprised to see how certain decisions or actions are taken by those that take it.\r\n\r\nDelusional as in, and this is just my opinion and perception, that people rather bs an issue rather than own it, deal with it, and move past it. For example a certain title was rejected by Apple due to its method of trying to use IAP; a violation of rules which any iOS developer should know about (sorry if that sounds arrogant but Apple's rules are pretty straightforward to those of us that work as iOS developers). Rather than admit time is needed to fix the mistake and just simply delay the game the necessary amount of time, the individual running that project ensured the higher ups the game will still make the deadline even though it was obvious to all of us that wasn't a realistic possibility. The day of or the day before the submission due date needed to ensure we can make the release date (I forget which) and it was finally delayed for needing more time. I always felt that this could have been a situation where someone(s) messed up but rather than just own it and do something about it, they bs their way to bidding time that just wasn't there. Of course I could be wrong but that is how it looked from my perspective. You'll see a couple questionable things like this that makes you wonder if the \"situation\" simply is a case of person A trying to save their own butts from what is likely to be the boogie-man rather than any real threat, even for minor things, rather than being a situation where they thought they could get it done but was wrong. Again I could be wrong since that was a situation from my perspective based on what I personally observed.\r\n\r\nYou see a number of questionable things and it doesn't seem like it comes from the top since the top in every company I've been too, including Disney, tends to take the position of \"it is what it is, we'll deal with it\" and it is those managers in the middle that treats everything, even minor things, like it is a cause to enter World War 3. It is those managers that fall under what I am describing that DI needs to take a look at and take action against, especially when their competency and even integrity can be easily shown through strong evidence to require HR and higher up's attention at the very least - and this is me being nice about it.\r\n\r\nEven with that said, not to mention the ton of things I could say but don't have time nor motivation, I still recommend joining if you are offered employment if you are ok with the idea that it might only last between 1 and 3 years due to the very unstable nature of the company. Simply working for Disney (in my case DI) and living in CA pretty much has a number of companies trying to steal you away (which might just be my experience but it was profound). And not just small companies but big ones such as Facebook, Google, Activision, Amazon, etc will eventually have people reaching out to you for opportunities within their companies.\r\n\r\nNo matter how long you are there, as long as you have a good team of people you feel you can trust - which was true for me until I joined the last team I was put on in the aftermath of one of DI's restructuring where I felt I couldn't trust the majority of the personalities there, then you will likely be fine. Of course I don't have experience working in every single department or job title, but what I have experienced I would recommend to others since Disney as a whole is a good company that will have many doors open for you simply by having had worked there.\r\n\r\nThe highest individual I had any direct interaction with was Nikki Katz and she is, in my opinion, a very smart and level-headed woman that is great at her job. Most higher ups like her at DI gave me this impression that they are good people with a lot of talent, drive, work ethic, etc. My only issue is with a few individuals lower than them on the hierarchy. Any run-ins I had with the CEO was random and candid, like holding the door open for each other, but the impression I get is that he is also a good guy and works hard to try to make the company the best it can be."}, {"review_title": "Great coworkers, but feel disposable", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I worked part time at Disneyland in merchandise.

Managers are moved around constantly, so cast members with seniority sometimes run the show at the location. By this I mean managers allow them to get away with things other employees don\u2019t. Seniority has priority when it comes to transferring locations. If a full time position becomes available & a full time cast member with high seniority is on the transfer wait list, they will get that position regardless of their work performance, which can screw over a part time cast member already at that location waiting on a full time slot to open. Management has no say in who gets the full time slots or any position, it\u2019s done threw casting, so even if a manager wants to move one of his cast members to full time, he has NO say in it at all, the computer automatically fills the slot with the next eligible employee by seniority. This seniority based concept allows and enables cast members who have been with the company for a while to slack off and throw the work load on the other cast members, with zero consequences. Seniority basically grants you immunity at Disney. I have seen cast members with high seniority leave shifts early, and receive no points for call outs. I have seen them basically tell the managers how to run the shift. Managers do not say no to them, they will let them leave a shift early for no good reason while we were busy, but force college program or part time employees who are sick (which is a health violation for food and beverage) stay the whole shift.

It's a great place to hone your customer service skills. You will meet people from all walks of life, all ages, all countries, and temperaments between completely amazed to rude and angry. However Disney gives you all the tools you need to deal with most situations. Training courses on diversity, in-depth training in customer service techniques, access to software for learning different languages, all internal communication is in both english and spanish, and a wealth of self paced learning online. Probably one of the best jobs if you don\u2019t need to live off you own wages, just need the benefits, and/or have no interest in advancement.", "cons": "As I just mentioned its a fun and rewarding job, just not financially. Average starting pay is barely above minimum wage and with the exception of peak times, they usually give you a minimum number of hours. Part-time has to give 4 days of availably but may only be worked 1 day a week. This and the fact that schedules are only posted a week in advance make it hard to get a second part-time job. Full-time is required to give \"full availability\". This means you have to be available to work any shift on any day, literally you have to be able to work 24/7 if needed. The minimum number of hours for full-time is 32 which can make budgeting tricky. Pay raises are small, between 1-5%, and in no way keeps up with inflation. It can take years to transfer from part-time to full-time not because of a lack of need but because upper management just won't make the opportunities available. Even if a full-timer leaves they don't fill the vacancy with an eligible part-timer looking to move up. They just back fill with another part-timer. However if you have a spouse who makes good money and you are working there for \"fun\" or to get medical benefits than non of this matters.\r\n\r\nThe management structure is very limiting for growth. There are very few levels between front-line castmember \"employee\" and upper management. This means it's hard to move up and extremely difficult to get into a middle management role. There are things you can do to enhance your pay like becoming a trainer or facilitator but the boost in pay is only in effect when you are officially scheduled for that role. None of these will help your chances to advance and if you're really good, could even hurt them. Managers are salary positions and tend to work more then 40 hours per week. Consideration for new manager candidates isn't done by performance or job knowledge but by favoritism. If you're liked you move up, if not you're stuck.

I became part of a hand-selected team which was slated to transition from Fox to Disney.

My position was yet to be properly formalized with HR department and I was never fully integrated into Disney corporate, evidenced most notably by a post-merger \"wall\" which continued to exist between former Fox and Disney employees. Essentially, Disney presented a dangling carrot to keep me and other department members working to meet critical 1st Quarter financial goals. A newly appointed department head that I now found myself reporting to had what I would call a \u201cmajor avoidance\u201d management style, slow to respond to emails and deliberately withholding information so I could continue to do my job. The division\u2019s organizational structure was kept purposely vague, no one really sure of job titles. Senior \"leaders\" would routinely set and then cancel daily and weekly video conference meetings. One instance I recall was a flurry of 6 emails in one day for an on-again/off-again team meeting, I surmise because they were busy trying to figure out who to eliminate and how to save their own positions. Eventually, pre-COVID-19, my position, along with others in my former Fox division and department, had been eliminated. I was told I could apply internally for the position that I had been already been doing for Disney for the past several months, which I did. A total waste of time, even though my resume matched 90% of the job description and I had already been doing a great job. Disney HR is terrible too, my HR \u201cpartner\u201d offered nothing but a vacant look and plastered on smile when I was handed my exit package. It is very sad how former Fox employees have been treated post-merger. Disney\u2019s intention all along was to eliminate older pensioned employees who earned higher salaries. Not a magical place.

I wouldnt have been so upset if I was a high school graduate who needed any job.......but I was getting my college degree then and knew I needed to be challenged ten times more than just putting clothing away in their rightful place.

One was because my makeup didnt look \"natural\" enough because I was wearing red lipstck. The second time was because my eyebrows did not match my blonde hair.  i was forced to dye my eyebrows blonde which made me look even less \"natural\".  When I grew my eyebrows out to their natural brown color, I decided to cut bangs so they could be covered....thus having no more reprimands.  I am now almost done with my masters at CSUN, and applied for a professional internship with Disney.  They really liked me on the phone, and I had made it to the last cut for a management internship.  The reason why they called me back to tell me I wasn't considered anymore was because they looked back at Disney records and realized I had those two reprimands.
