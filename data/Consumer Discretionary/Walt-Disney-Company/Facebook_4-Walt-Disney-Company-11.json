Terrible work/life balance. All of the remote-work advantages afforded by the pandemic are being taken away, forcing people to work in an office that isn't particularly nice by modern standards. Some of the technology teams, in particular, work in buildings that are barely equipped to be warehouses, let alone hold full-time staff. Work days are usually 9am - 7pm, so good luck visiting friends/family after work. Company also doesn't embrace summer Friday's (which, I know, is a huge perk at some places, how dare I ask for such a thing), so maintaining a social life can be difficult. Upward mobility is impossible. From my (limited) perspective, every manager rules their team with an iron fist, from the CEO down to the interns. Every employee lives in a box, and straying outside that box makes you seem like a rebel, which is looked down upon. From what I've seen, most of the best, most interesting, and most unique benefits that the company has to offer (free tuition, community volunteer work, tickets to parks, apparel, etc.) are largely performative and very few people are able to make legitimate use of them. Take, for example, the daycare center that Disney provides employees. Sounds like a great perk, but in reality is incredibly difficult to get your children into due to the competitive and very long waiting list. Disappointed overall that this company's words often don't match its actions.

Getting a decent consistent schedule is next to impossible even if you have been there several years. The company as a whole bribes cast with disguised tax write offs such as trinket name tag gifts, comp tickets, cast discounts, activities aka practice rounds of parades etc before it starts but nothing can replace being paid with more cash in our paycheck to pay bills. Moving up into the company is a tricky process and is often riddled with favoritism based on who interviewed you.

Disney relies on low income low education immigrants to fill overworked and underpaid housekeeping positions. It is primarily Haitian and Latinos filling the spots. Management always say they appreciate us but nothing is ever done to make our roles easier, we are only given more work and more standards. We do not receive free meals despite working long hours and even on major holidays. It is a paycheck to paycheck job and you do not qualify for food assistance so most people are forced to be food insecure and rely on food left behind from guests. I know of other housekeepers personally that are dual income who cannot afford the cost of living in the state of FL without overtime.

Complementary park admission is fantastic. Discounts were great. I was afforded the opportunity to work for various lines of businesses (LOBs) and under different managers.

If you stray even the slightest you will feel the social repercussions of this. For me, it felt like I was overlooked for many promotions and considering I had a great record, guest compliments, and peer references, I had to wonder why that was. I left the company after being furloughed for over a year, so I did not have to experience the full manifestation of social change (for the worse) that many current cast members have experienced but I can tell you that I probably would have been isolated had I gone back. For a company that promotes Diversity and Inclusion, they are very specific with who that includes. \n\nProfessional Cons - what felt like endless room for opportunity became a barren wasteland towards the end of my career. I had reached out to management multiple times for new opportunities and responsibilities and I was either pushed towards the Management program or told to stay in my lane. I know there is so much more than just being a manager at the Disneyland resort (for me, I do not want to take on a leadership role) but I was never recommended for anything. \n\nAcademic Cons - The new Aspire program was sold as an opportunity to have your education paid for (100%) by the company. I earned my Bachelors earlier in my Disney career, so I opted for the Masters program. I started as one of the first groups to go through Aspire in 2019. I worked throughout the pandemic 2020/2021 and finished in March 2021. During this time, I was furloughed (previously mentioned) and receiving unemployment from the State of California. The Walt Disney Company told the State of California that I was receiving a salary during my furlough ( I was not, I was having my education paid for) and although it showed up on my paystubs (not as income but as education credit) the State of California is accusing me of Unemployment Fraud.
