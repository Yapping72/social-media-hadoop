I could do a better job than they can full stop. They've completely lost sight of our original goal and culture and they're using Covid as an excuse. Our policies literally change day by day minute by minute which means that Guest's keep getting a different answer each time which is frustrating not only for them but for us. Our motto used to be \"Solve for Yes\" now they want to stick in team meetings about courtesy and show and solving yes, meanwhile the only answer we can now ever give Guest's is no and I don't know. Our Guest's have been waiting for a refund we promised for almost a year now (NO JOKE!). I originally had sympathy for the company understanding that never in our history have we refunded Guest's to this extant and we essentially had to create an entirely new system. However, instead of getting it right on the first or second try, the refund process kept jumping to different departments and was constantly being handed off which meant that nothing was getting done. Now we finally have a department working on it and it seems like a one-man band...I'm not even kidding. Thousands of refunds still need to be issued to some of our Guests and the department might as well be a hole in the wall. And after all of that, this company couldn't care less because even after cancelling their passes, thousands of people and old Passholders are still willing to come back and pay full price for half the experience. We have been barred from making Magic, quite literally. We are unable to give compensation for the smallest of issues let alone huge issues. So for anyone calling and waiting to speak to us for hours for a bit of Magic. Good luck! A Cast Member could beg and plead to management on a Guest's behalf and the answer is a flat no at this time, again using Covid as an excuse for our inability to give the Customer Service we have become known for. We are constantly being misleading and misinformation from management regarding our policies and procedures which in the end hurt the Guest and our reputation. One day we were unable to allow Passholders to use AP inventory for Park Pass Reservations and after a whole day of telling people \"No, I'm so sorry\" the policy changed the next day with an e-mail siting that we don't want our Passholders to feel like they're being penalized for booking a Resort Hotel stay. I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT! In fact, I did. We all did, and we were ignored. After multiple attempts to move into a better department that might have act together, I was denied. I'm an excellent worker with a ton of experience that raised myself into this position to help people. Now I'm being given less opportunities to move into other departments just because I gave myself more experience and moved up. Usually the higher you move, the more experience you receive, the more valuable you become to a company and therefore the more opportunities you have. Not here you don't. The straw that has finally broken the camels back was being lied to by management. After a 12 hour shift for mandatory OT I was feeling quite unwell. There were still calls in the queue which every night I always clear. I don't do it for management, I stay on the phones past my out time for our Guests who have been patient and for my fellow Cast Members. However, this one night I was feeling terrible and I just needed to close my eyes. Out of respect, I reached out to my leader (manager) and let him know how I was feeling and I asked if just this once I could leave at my scheduled out time without penalty or having my \"sick time\" taken out since it was was my scheduled out time. The manager lied to me and implied that if I left at my scheduled out time while there were calls in the queue I would be penalized. The next day I get an e-mail stating the opposite and I asked another manager who confirmed that we could not be penalized for leaving at my scheduled out time as I was adhering to the schedule. I'm thinking that calling HR is a good idea about right now and I can't wait to get another job."}, {"review_title": "good, but pay is better if you are hired in", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Archivist in Burbank, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and flexibility if you don't work in the parks", "cons": "Low pay, large corporation mindset."}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 May 2021", "job_title": "Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company with wonderful benefits and cool perks.
