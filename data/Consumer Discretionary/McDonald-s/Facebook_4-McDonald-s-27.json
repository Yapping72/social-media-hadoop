Management at McDonald's is the worst and they do not care about their employees and have pretty much openly said it to our faces. Managers cuss out employees that are under them. We're treated like crap and the \"customer is always right\" demographic is insanely cherished to the point where even blatant lies and dumb comments are used as an excuse to write us up. We're not treated like people, our comments are disregarded, and we're not given any time to breathe. Ex: I missed my sister's wedding because they said it wasn't a \"good enough excuse to not go to work and it would be a write-up if I didn't show\". Another example: I am 17 and have to go to high school at 7 in the morning and my managers know this. However, they continue to schedule me til close at midnight. This becomes a problem when other people that are closing do not do their jobs right and I have to do it all myself and am out til 2 in the morning and have to get up to go to school in 5 hours. I have now gone a whole month without working because they refuse to put me on the schedule and I have not gotten paid a dime. My girlfriend is having to pay for MY gas and food because I cannot pay for it myself. It's sad and McDonald's can definitely do better."}, {"review_title": "just a 14 year old kid trying to make money, in life, I hope you can understand", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Sept 2022", "job_title": " in Youngstown, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "just to make money, for a long time", "cons": "cooking for the customers, ."}], [{"review_title": "Great for a first job but hectic", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Crew Member", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-very faced paced\n- nice people\n- great for a first job\n- free meals\n- free uniforms", "cons": "- mean people\n- lazy managers\n- unmanageable \n- 1 shift only a week"}, {"review_title": "My experience in my Work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I learn a lot of things like packaging food for deliver, cashier, taking order and clean the restaurant.", "cons": "Need to know how much you treat your staff and give more increase salary."}, {"review_title": "Great Benefits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Aug 2022", "job_title": "General Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working with a diverse group of people, lots of networking, people service- great benefits at every level from crew all the way to general manager, including mental health and wellness programs.", "cons": "Sometimes they forget we are individual humans, or miss the point of what we\u2019re asking for, but I suppose that comes from a certain level when you work for a corporation"}, {"review_title": "The best company i wud refer to anyone to buy food from there", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Crew Member", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working in a good condition and work as a team.", "cons": "Actually i havent faced any challenge beign busy is what i like most"}, {"review_title": "What most people expect", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great opportunity to make friends to be honest...", "cons": "Overworked and underpaid - management wasn't always the greatest but you could tell they tried to do their best considering the circumstances."}, {"review_title": "Assistant general manager", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Store Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I lead coach be a role model and love driving sales", "cons": "I grew stronger by making customers happy"}, {"review_title": "Not worth it", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Customer Service", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours good experience working in a customer serving role", "cons": "Pay under 18s the same as over 18s as they do more work than the older members in the same position"}, {"review_title": "Great Place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Oct 2022", "job_title": "First Assistant Manager in Kamloops, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work at.
