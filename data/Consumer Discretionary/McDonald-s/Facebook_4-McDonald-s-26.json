Employers actually love to see candidates who have worked in McDonald\u2019s, because the job is demanding employers value those with this job experience. Working here shows many positive attributes, such as: resilience, respect, resourcefulness, leadership skills, independence, team-work, and so much more. The value of this job on paper is immeasurable. As a bonus the pay is also great, especially for a student. They also take care of you there, they have many programmes for inclusivity and protection for all minorities (that they do actually take extremely seriously), mental health programmes, weekly offers for a multitude of different stores and brands, amongst a lot more. They value community and the team being familiar and friendly, my store often arranged get togethers outside of work to help with this. McDonald\u2019s is also amazing with scheduling, especially for students, it is completely tailored to what you can and cannot do, the flexibility for students is something you won\u2019t find anywhere else. Students are valued heavily in the workplace, managers take studies seriously and always offer to help push you further in studies and high education interviews, offering to be references and to put in good words. They offer opportunities to students to advance their way up in roles too. Additionally, their attitude towards employees with disabilities is amazing, and they tailor shifts, tasks, and accessibility needs based upon these. I honestly couldn\u2019t think of a better place to work as a student.", "cons": "The job is stressful, and pretty taxing (though I suppose this could also be seen as a positive, due to the skills and resilience it\u2019ll teach you). McDonald\u2019s is know for being understaffed as well, and when it gets busy, it can be extremely distressing. The stigma, this isn\u2019t a con about the actual tasks of the job, more so what the public assume about employees who work here - it gets tiring hearing people talk down on you because of your job, when in reality having the job is pushing me to a very positive future.
