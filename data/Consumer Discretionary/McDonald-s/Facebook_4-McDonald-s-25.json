They do a very good job of pretending to be nice. Managers are very rude to every new person and it takes a few months before it feels like you\u2019re not walking on eggshells around them. Pretty sure all those managers are 100% unaware that they regularly treat everyone around them in a disgusting manner, they make it seem like it\u2019s normal for them. My coworkers sucked at training me. Every single person never failed to get extremely mad at you when you do something wrong on something you were never trained on. Got called retarded on a daily basis for mistakes they all make on an hourly basis, very toxic environment. I have autism so obviously this absolutely sucked being called that everyday that I worked there, but they never knew. The customers will absolutely drain the life out of you. You\u2019ll learn that a lot of people don\u2019t know basic life concepts and that you\u2019ll still have to pretend like they\u2019re correct. Many old people that come through don\u2019t know how to do basic math, that\u2019s a huge thing. You will get yelled at by these old people who suck at math, and nothing you will say or demonstrate will get through to them, so YOU have to act like the stupid one to get them the hell out of the drive through. Have fun being timed on everything. The whole idea of timing our orders is impressively stupid. About every other car is a family, and if it\u2019s a mom ordering, usually takes at least 100 seconds. We\u2019re told to keep it under 20. They completely ignore that a large portion of customers naturally take FOREVER to order, yet we still get punished. Very unfair.

Unfair pay for a multi billion dollar company, sick pay is mostly a myth, the uniform takes away any shred of personality that you might have, they won't allow you to have your phone on you, even if you're a parent that wants (and rightfully so) to check on your kids throughout the day. We're almost encouraged not to recycle, food waste is a massive issue, as well as cross-contamination, don't get me started on injuries (burns, cuts, etc). There are some amazing people working for Mcdonalds, but we're all treated like numbers and costumers treat us as if we're human garbage, there is barely any protection from rude, creepy, costumers."}]]
