Employee benefits and well-being practices non-existent - company used to host yearly conferences, Christmas parties, holiday gifting, and incentives. These have all been removed without explanation despite the explanation being clear. The company has gone from offering luxury experiences and gifting to nothing. Annual Leave limitations - no allowance during November - January. History of not allowing employees to take or carry on their legally accrued holiday allowance during times of lockdown. Micromanagement and lack of proper communication skills from management teams across the business. Many store managers are simply inexperienced and incredibly passive aggressive towards their client advisors. Majority of employees are also too scared to bring these issues to attention due to justified concerns over retaliation. Favouritism - top sellers receive significantly better treatment by management in matters as simple as attitude expressed towards them. Being on receiving end of either one is incredibly uncomfortable. High turnover of employees - at joining, the brand was filled with loyal and tenured employees, it has since managed those employees out of the business and new hires are only lasting 6 months on average due to poor working conditions and lack of good pay. Every employee I know is or has considered changing workplaces. Unreasonable expectations - such as reprimands for not checking work phone / communications on days off (not only unreasonable but also illegal). Expectations of serving clients back to back for hours without breaks for drink or bathroom. When taken, those small breaks are timed and managers are known to pressure employees into returning to the shop floor. I have witnessed managers following employees to the bathrooms on numerous occasions. Lack of care - personal circumstances are irrelevant and unimportant to the business. I have seen employees reprimanded and placed on disciplinary measures for matters such as long term sicknesses, homelessness, and family issues. HR team which is neither human nor resourceful - reps are incredibly condescending and only speak in formulaic terms without providing any real answers or solutions. The only competent HR Manager left the business. Incompetent Customer Service team - providing very contradictory and incorrect information to clients which then has to be corrected in store. They create more customer complaints than they resolve. Despite enormous amounts of feedback they do not acknowledge fault or improve. Lack of consistency - company policies are not adhered to. Managers authorise complimentary services the moment they lose control over a client issue. This undermines all the work a client advisor puts in to explain policies such as repair charges. Company policies regarding in-store operations are also not adhered. Matters which are strictly to be performed by management are delegated to other members of staff. Hiring outside of the business - the company is incredibly reluctant to promote employees and provide employees with the tools they need to progress. They predominantly hire outsiders for management roles. Unfortunately, these hires are not only unfamiliar with the business but very rude and lacking reasonable management style. Salary increase rates more than halved during the pandemic. Severe inconsistency in salaries across the business also. The company is more than able to create a tiered salary system and yet has not done so."}], [{"review_title": "Great Environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Operations in Beverly Hills, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Loved working here.

For me it was a bit stressful, just because I tend to be on the perfectionistic side and got down on myself when I had work sent back or rejected by QA (but rejections are completely normal, and they do allow a lot of learning time to correct mistakes). It seemed like a nice atmosphere with the employees, although there are always those who take everything a *bit* too seriously and can cause you some stress, but it really just depends on how much you internalize things.", "cons": "Make sure you ask a TON of questions to your trainer/manager/HR rep/attendance coordinator, because the company definitely does not give you all the information you need on a silver platter. My fellow trainees and I had to make multiple trips to HR to figure out how to sign up for the company website, benefits, when we would get our sign-on bonus (which came 5 weeks later than promised on day 1), how their very complicated attendance system worked, etc. It seemed like company information was dispersed among five of our superiors, and we had to spend a lot of time figuring out who had accurate information on the subjects we had questions about. \n\nThe hours are fine, but there are mandatory Saturdays occasionally (twice a month was common). They do provide a week or two of notice for these, which is nice. \n\nOne of my biggest grudges with Tiffany was that, during training, you are in a classroom setting with a trainer who checks every bit of your work, and sometimes even fixes things for you if it would take you too long to do it yourself. However, as soon as you get out of training, you're just kind of dumped onto the work floor to succeed or flounder. You can still ask questions to your superiors, but the advice is much less detailed. Many times, when I asked for a superior to check my product to make sure it was good enough to send to QA, they said it was fine.. and then a day or two later it was rejected from QA and my quality rate went down. \n\nMy other biggest complaint is that, as a setter, you have a speed and a quality rate to follow. However, if your ring is sent to be polished before QA, and the polisher messes up (over-polishes/shaves off some of your piece/ messes up the engraving, etc.), the fault still comes back to you. The polishers do not have a quality rate. So you could be sending out a perfectly fine product that took you a couple of hours to complete, only to find you have to completely re-do it with no rate effect, because of something you can't control. I found this aspect of the job very frustrating.\n\nFinal complaint: I was hired on a night shift, which they advertised for even though \"night shift\" hadn't actually been created yet. I was promised multiple dates for night shift to begin, but it was pushed back month after month. By the time that I left, night shift was still and illusion and the promise of a new date for it to begin still lingered in the abyss, where I assume it will remain."}], [{"review_title": "It's surely in transition....", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Client Advisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Generous discount, pleasant surroundings, beautiful product", "cons": "In the midst of a company transition so it's not smooth.

Also, I can not expect them to fix every long time Tiffany employees salary, but it is not even close to competitive to similar jobs, and asking for a raise to get with the current market got shot down instantly. \n \nThis is most likely growing pains and mixing the old guard with the new LVMH leadership, but everything is up in the air at the moment. It will be full steam ahead..this has to get done one day, and the very next day a project will no longer be a priority or leadership has made an 11th hour design change. If you are on the operations side of the business be aware and prepared to work as hard as you can to meet a deadline for it not to matter anymore. Then restart the cycle a few more times.\n\nAlso they need to ease up on the office requirements. I understand we pay a lot of money to have office buildings, so you want people in them. But, it's a new world, people in the SAME office still meet virtually on Microsoft teams.

Managers that curse and scream on a daily basis, pretend to work, make racist remarks, stay in there office, complain about their employees being stupid. That's just to name a few of the things I've seen over the past years. The store has been hemorrhaging employees to the point there is no one left. No one wants to come to work anymore because of the atmosphere. And upper management couldn't care less. Sales have been down for quite some time and the economy doesn't match the sales plan numbers which just go up yearly. Upper management just sits and smiles with there 7+ figure incomes. While the lower employees and back bone of the company slowly die mentally and financially. It's an insane circle that I've never seen at any other company. And good luck trying to advance because there are no positions and no room to advance. They will tell you otherwise when you get hired and lie about advancing but believe me you will find nothing since all management and upper management is given to outside luxury competitor company positions to try and get an upper hand on other companies.

T&Co's product has tradition, classic design and a legacy that transcends a broad spectrum of ethnic, social/economic back grounds.  Clients are very interesting and generally easy to please. Operations staff is committed to support your sales, ensuring quality service.  It's very fulfilling to match romantic visions with product knowledge and high standards.", "cons": "Sales professionals are on their own to figure out antiquated sales information systems, operations flow, and fulfillment, despite legitimate training protocol. Unlike other retail environment, \"trial by fire\" on the sales floor is not in your best interest. Tiffany's has a \"customer is always right\" culture, and mistakes are not tolerated, no matter how innocent.  Customized sales transactions create land mines, and new employees require strict and thorough training.  Any sale beyond a \"TAKE\" requires thorough understanding of how operations and fulfillment work and is tantamount to success.  Training of a variety of  transactions is scattered or inconsistent, at best.\r\n\r\nNew sales staff is left to anticipate without the experience to do so.  While the sales tools and information systems lack in thorough directions, the experienced sales professionals have no incentive to give new employees the tribal knowledge necessary to be successful. In fact previous employees often complain of being \"set up\" for failure.  It's a very stressful environment, not for the meek.  \r\n\r\nProspective employees should ask specifics about training -  When? How long? Who is providing and how long have they worked at Tiffany's?  If your trainer is less than 6 months in, your training will only skim the surface.  Your position is high exposure and deserves various dress rehearsals, not a day at \"The Improv\".  Again, Tiffany's has a no-tolerance rule about mistakes.  They want seamless, perfect customer experience. \r\n\r\nNew sales employees be smart: Be aware when your training is incomplete & document it to HR representative.  State when it did or did not occur, what was or was not covered. Take thorough stock in online sales training courses, beyond the required, within your first two weeks.  Know the systems before you learn the products.  \r\n\r\nManagement doesn't necessarily need you to be successful.  Always have your paper trail; keep a copy of a sku sticker for negative inventory issues, never throw away customer info sheets and right notes about special sales.  They are your evidence when questioned 1 month later.  While your head is swimming in product knowledge, you'll be asked how you typed in a sku # for an item that your store doesn't have in stock, or why the customer was delivered a size 8 ring instead of size 7.  Only your info sheets are your friend while your interrogated. Remember, if a sale is associated with your sales #, the buck stops with you.\r\n\r\nSales quotas are serious business at T&Co.  However, non commissioned employees (Operations staff & Management Team) are often on the floor selling to a customer, to the disadvantage of multiple commissioned sales people on duty.  One could defend that sales staff was occupied now and then, but it occurs so often that you conclude management is competing with sales somehow.  Very little loyalty between the two levels.  \r\n\r\nBased on this culture, Sales employees are routinely \"let go\" for performance issues.  If asked for resignation letter, be aware of your rights and know whether if this is in your best interest.  An application for unemployment benefits is rejected if you resign, so choose wisely.  Sales if rough and tumble.  Tiffany's is no exception. Be forewarned and good luck."}, {"review_title": "The worst place to work ...", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 May 2014", "job_title": "Operations Professional in Honolulu, HI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Get in, use the generous employee discount, and get out.", "cons": "The worst management I have ever encountered in my life.

They used to be good, now they are expensive.\r\n\r\nSalary is good if you started with the Company more than eight years ago.

The bad side of this is, that they will use it they way it will work best for them. Many years ago it was use as a tool to help on the employee individual development, now is used as a tool to control what that employee earns. The PMP was used to recognize the employee's real performance, now is used to point out what the employee is not doing.\r\n\r\nOne very interesting thing about the PMP is that I said, it was really used as a personal development tool. In this era it is used to add more responsibilities to the employee. The employee has to choose three things that he/she would like to learn.

If someone at your company quits, your goals increases until they find someone else, whether they will admit to it or not--they don't admit to much. Part of a manager's job is to keep you thinking everything is great, understandably, but it's very frustrating. The last year I was there, the company changed the commission structure so that we would have more \"potential for larger commissions.\" With the old structure, you would receive 1-2% depending on what you sold or whether or not you made your goal. With the new structure, you receive a plat 1% fee if you didn't make your goal, 1.5% if you made your goal or exceeded it by 15%, I believe it was, then if you exceeded it by 15% you could get 2% and so on. Additionally the goals increased and there were fewer new or large purchase clients coming in everyday. That holiday season was one of the worst I'd see or heard of. Basically it was near impossible to reach the \"potential\" 2.5 or 3% commission. Also, You would make less money than with the previous structure, EVEN WHEN YOU MADE YOUR GIAL, which became increasingly difficult to do, especially if you hadn't been there at the beginning of the store's opening to snag the local consistent, wealthy bunch. \r\n\r\nTo top it off, managers and non-sales employees are brought out to help sale during busy times (you know, when the sales are actually good) and would take sales from sales from Sales Professionals--they usually aren't allowed or won't to pass the sale over to you, even when you free up. \r\n\r\nSmaller issues I couldn't handle were working all but one weekend a month. I would have liked to work just one weekend day 3 times a month, then get one full weekend off, but then again, I would have likely been further from my goal that way. Also, vacation days are few and difficult to get. Good luck making your goal on the months you take vacation--even though you are paid to supposedly take into account the missing commission you would have earned during the time you were gone (may not be accurate), if you don't make your goal, you lose out hugely on the rest of your commission. \r\n\r\nAlso, not much room for growth or very slow growth."}, {"review_title": "Hostile environment with little communication between management and staff", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "4 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Operations Assistant in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, 401k, medical and eye insurance.

They sent the proxys out without even sending the prospectus out or even letting voting members know what raises they wanted. Last year, our CEO got a 15 million dollar golden parachute if he gets let go from the company if some one takes over. The average raise of a Tiffany salesperson is .30 cents. \r\n\r\nAlso, read the fine print. If you were hired after January 2006, you are part of what is called the Excess Plan, where if the company terminates you for cause or you leave the company prior to age 65, if  theyyou fail to execute and adhere to non-competition and confidentiality covenants, ie if they fire you for anything, you lose all your profit-sharing that you earned.

Many managers and directors come from middle-class backgrounds and see their job as an opportunity to become part of some elite ruling class. It's completely divorced from reality, and actual rich people don't behave like this.\r\n\r\nThe Operations team is expected to say \"yes\" to every request thrown at them, without any regard for priority.  When you're handling $15,000 in diamond jewelry, or have all the cash the store took in the prior day on your desk, you can't just get up and walk away from it to get a customer a glass of water just because one of the sales team is freaking out over it. As ridiculous as this sounds, management can, and has, reprimanded operations team members for not doing exactly this. \r\n\r\nThere are also a lot of cynical efforts made to use Operations people as salespeople, in part because our commission rate is lower (but the hourly *is* higher).\r\n\r\nHR seems to protect managers who act inappropriately. Countless claims were made in good faith against a store director who acted inappropriately around women and made crucial decisions based (at least in part) on race. It wasn't even a secret that any of this was happening, but no remedial action was taken. Because of this, the store suffered a turnover rate close to 100%.\r\n\r\nNo career growth opportunities, with promotions seemingly based on favoritism or nepotism. \r\n\r\nOperational expenses are poorly decided upon, like continuing to purchase 15 bottles of silver polish per month, despite only using 1 bottle per month, which leads to spoilage and, ultimately, waste. The company also decided to opt for more expensive hand soap for the bathrooms while simultaneously planning layoffs. \r\n\r\nAncient computer systems - younger employees think they're being Punk'd when they're presented with AS/400.\r\n\r\nOh, and Google the time they conspired to fire an African-American store manager over race."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, great pay, great hours for retail, co-workers felt like family.

The pay for a security professional is one of the best in the business.  They fly you out to New Jersey for a paid training and put you in a pretty nice hotel.  You are in a relaxing environment with jazz music and you get to look good and wear a suit while making a good paycheck.  So what could possibly be bad about any of that?  Once you get back from the training in New Jersey and begin in your own store, the reality check begins.  I've never worked at a job with so many unhappy employees.  The store if full of fake \"enthusiastic\" people for the most part, its just the nature of thier game.  My Store Director came off very hospitable but ended up being hard to deal with in his own way as he would sit in his office and spy on everyone watching the CCTV.  You stand all day, and stand, and stand, and stand...you watch people sell jewelry all day and listen to the same songs repeat themselves all day.  Theres no sitting down at all..You work 8 hours and they make you take an hour unpaid lunch.  Since there are not alot of real tasks to do they will have you clean jewelry, work in operations (shipping and recieving in the back), and help set up displays.  There's alot of confusion as to what the \"Senior\" Branch Security Officer does as well..sometimes they make him think he is your boss and at other times he's just \"another co-worker\".  The Senior Officer i worked with walked around like he was guarding the president of the united states and would take 5 minutes to tell you to complete a task that our boss gave us and talked to you as if you were incompitant and can't handle mundane tasks like taking out the trash.  It was a nightmare. To put it plain and simple it's like this: If you have a true passion for law enforcement and public safety and need a job that is rewarding other than just pay and you want to move up and make a difference in life then this job isn't for you.  However if you are one of those kind of people who just want to come to work and get a halfway decent pay check and grab a discount on some jewelry then you may be able to tolerate this for a year or so.  The turn over is high.  The human resource staff i talked to told me once that they pay so high just to keep someone around for a bit and that if they can get 2 years out of someone then they've done thier job.

When representing us at events or in the local community, I was embarrassed for them to be associated with Tiffany & Co. as a management team.  They micromanage in a way that makes employees doubt they know how to do their own job.  They are unprofessional when it comes to disciplinary procedures.  They are unethical when it comes to simple labor laws such as harassment, discrimination, and time off/breaks.  If an employee ever had a problem in one of these areas they often had to go much higher than store level, even higher than regional HR, and still wait several months before anything was accomplished.  Perhaps the biggest con of working for Tiffany & Co. is the low morale due to many things including the layoffs resulting from the recession.  The low amount of managerial experience is reflected in the managements teams response to a low morale:  just pretend it doesn't exist and ban employees from any negative comments in the store. In addition management has proven to be insensitive when it comes to issues such as deaths and severe illness in the family.  Most of the time you have to fight to get time off for it and are rudely belittled for needing the time off.

Management is condensing and will speak down to you in front of other colleagues on the sales floor. Cross training in other departments such as Customer Service as well as on the job education is nil. I even offered to come in and train on my day off, but was told that they would not cross train seasonal workers much to our detriment. I learned more about the Schlumberger which sells at a trickle whereas I learned nothing about Return to Tiffany which sells constantly. Job shadowing is short (I shadowed for one day, and did not even ring up a transaction before I was put on the floor to sell for myself). Making a small mistake on a transactions means that you'll get a lecture about whatever easily correctable mistake you made after the fact instead of training their employees' to prevent such mistakes. This maelstrom of negative culture makes you second guess yourself and made me feel uncomfortable around managers which is a feeling that I have never felt before. There is a cliquey culture where either you belong or you don't. The sales professionals, \"professional\" is perhaps a bit of a stretch, will go out of their way to give you the least amount of training so that you are not competing with their sales. If you complain that you have not received enough training, and make a comment that \"x\" did not train you properly or for long enough. Instead of addressing the issue and keeping it confidential, my manager told the employee that I had lodged a complaint against her and told her all of the things that I had said to her in confidence. Thus, nothing was resolved except this employee would no longer even say \"Hello\" to me or address me in any way after the fact. Since the floor managers are rarely on the floor, their information about you will be coming from other sources so let's hope that your colleagues like you. The managers have meetings where they talk about employees with the door open (where you can hear how they actually feel about you instead of the usual \"happy to see you\" facade they put on). Seeing a colleague cry because they overheard the managers'  gossip about him/her really made me realise that everything in this store, including the products and interactions between managers and associates, are merely gilded."}, {"review_title": "Like working at a used car sales lot.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Dec 2015", "job_title": "Sales Professional in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits are ok, and the employee store offers deeply discounted items that you could actually afford.
