When it doesn't, CS reps have the power to make things right for customers, which is fabulous.\r\n\r\nUnlimited time off (within reason, and when it's available) is awesome.", "cons": "Ultimately, the cons outweigh the pros.  I will be voluntarily leaving Netflix for a new job in the very near future.\r\n\r\nNetflix treats employees like they're completely expendable.  I realize that no one is indispensable to a company, but Netflix uses up employees like I use up tissues when I have a cold.  The turnover is ridiculous, and it doesn't have to be that way.\r\n\r\nFor CS reps, the main statistic used to determine our \"worthiness\" is the DSAT.  Customers get asked a simple question after contacting customer service: \"Were you satisfied with the call?\"  A \"no\" response counts against the rep, even if it was something the rep couldn't control (I'm sorry, it looks like your bank declined your card for this month's service fee.), or the customer was making an unreasonable demand (I got a disc that won't play!  Give me six months of free service or I'm cancelling!).  Netflix's stance is that we should be able to sugar-coat bad news so well that the customer doesn't hang up unhappy.  This method of measurement is incredibly flawed and has led to reps \"gaming\" the system to avoid \"no\" responses.  \r\n\r\nNetflix does not give raises.  Period.  Not for cost of living, not for length of time employed, not even for outstanding performance.  I have worked there 3+ years and my stats have been stellar the whole time.  So stellar, I'm one of the people they have trainees shadow, to hear how to handle calls properly.  I have *never* gotten a raise.  Monetarily, Netflix considers my value to be the same as a new hire who just got out of training.\r\n\r\nNo paid time off.  (Unless I want to take a pay cut and bank that toward paid time off.)\r\n\r\nMandatory overtime during the holidays.  (They're promising it won't happen again this year, but that's what they said last year ... and we had mandatory overtime for three months last winter.  And the winter before.)\r\n\r\nExtremely limited career options - unless you want to be a CS supervisor, you're pretty much out of luck at the call center.\r\n\r\nNarrow-focus hiring - Netflix hires people with EXACTLY the skills they need for a particular position.  If that position goes away, so does the person.  There is very little provision for cross-training or retraining a good employee to fit them in somewhere else.\r\n\r\nTRaSE - one exception to the cross-training policy has been TRaSE, which is a disaster, so far.  TRaSE combined the department that handles streaming tech support escalations with the department that handles loss prevention: billing fraud, shipping issues, physical inventory problems and website content issues.  They all received cross-training, and even though there's more people to handle problems now, CS reps can never get a response when they have an urgent loss prevention issue.  Reps have to tell customers \"someone will get back to you within 1-3 business days.\"  What happened to \"one call resolution\"?  There's a guaranteed \"no\" response for my DSAT.  Thanks a lot.\r\n\r\nWorkforce Management can't seem to forecast how much staff is needed; we will have weeks where they offer to let reps go home early every day, and then a couple of weeks later, they're offering voluntary extra hours and begging people to stay after their shifts.  This is probably related to the fact that Marketing doesn't feel like they need to let anyone know about promotions until the last minute.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Marketing, they don't seem to feel a need to ask anyone what kind of impact various promotions will have on the rest of Netflix's operations.  The \"no credit card necessary for a free trial\" promo was a fiasco, much of which could have been avoided by asking some seasoned reps a few key questions.  \r\n\r\nThe same can be said about some of the \"tests\" that Engineering sets up on the website.  Isn't it logical to maybe ask a few questions of the people who actually talk to the customers before you try something out?  I realize that we need to find out what works and what doesn't, but if a \"test\" makes the service unusable or unpalatable for a customer and they call to complain, CS reps can't remove them from the \"test\".  Netflix is willing to lose the customer because that's a valid \"test result\".  There has to be a better way.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian service was launched prematurely, in my opinion.

At Netflix, they not only encourage it but really urge you to try to broaden your own skill set.\r\n\r\nOur paid time off policy is not to be beat... Netflix has none! No two weeks a year or so many days off for personal/sick leave GARBAGE. Instead, you just tell your manager that you wanted to take three weeks off next month and he says, okay have a good time.

You HAVE to rate your peers and get ratings back from the people you asked to rate you. From my experience, its totally pointless and a huge waste of time / energy across the company. If we spent even a quarter of the time and money it takes to run, manage, and maintain this 360 review process, we'd have double the amount of movies in our Watch Instantly offering.\r\n\r\nDon't come here thinking you'll rise through the ranks!

Netflix basically gives you a warning on your first mistake, and then fires you after your second mistake.  This is why the annual turnover rate is well over 20%.  Since there is an entirely new set of employees every few years, nobody knows what process to follow, and everything is chaotic.  HR solves this by saying \"there is no process for anything! Make it up as you go along!\"  Sure, if I fired all the employees every few years I'd stay away from process too.  \r\n\r\nThe key problem is that with all the firings most employees spend the day simply trying to find cover.  The ass covering at Netflix is legendary.  Nobody wants to innovate.  Nobody wants to reach outside their comfort zone.  Netflix has created a culture of fear, and the way in which they manage terminations reinforces the culture of fear (they immediately demonize the terminated employee, and try to make the termination serve as a lesson to others). \r\n\r\nThe culture of fear is so ingrained in Netflix that many managers only have one tool for managing their directs, and that is to threaten to fire them.  There simply is no other process for managing poor performance (remember, there is no process - they will admit this to you if you ask).\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the last thing you should be warned about is their \"high performance\" culture.  Their justification for all the firings is that the fired employees weren't high performers.  But since there is no process, no record-keeping, there is no objective measurement of performance.  So \"high performers\" end up being the employees that get along with the boss and keep a low profile.  \"High performers\" at Netflix are not employees that take risks, interact with outside groups, or produce a high volume of work.    \r\n\r\nNetflix loves to talk about high performance but they have the lowest standard for high performance that I've ever seen.

A company that functions on fear is not a place for the long term.  When everyone in a room is asked do they fear being fired and everyone says yes, that is a big problem.\r\n  b.  A culture of watching your back and stabbing others in the back.  Many employees, including C level people, participate and have learned that tossing others under the bus, keeps them safe.   They see this as a way to protect themselves from scrutiny from above.  Employees and managers are all too comfortable talking about what is not working with a person.   The 360 review process reinforces this.  Those who have been there the longest are almost soulless with regard to firings.  They have fired or seen so many people let go that they don\u2019t really care anymore.   \r\n6.  You can be fired without warning, feedback, or any coaching.

Directors and VPs are constantly evaluating managers, so anytime you make a mistake, are perceived not to be cutting edge, it could be your turn.\r\n9.  HR\u2019s job is to hire and show people the door.  HR brags about how good they are at firing people.  They don\u2019t help employees, nor are they there to help employees become better.   Their role is simply to ensure the company doesn\u2019t get sued and headhunt for all the people that are turning over.  \r\n10. Managers main role is making their team better through constrantly looking for their weaker employees.  Leaders are asked could they hire someone better.

That means that there is a push to the website every two weeks.  This has a few consequences.  One is that there is a high percentage of overhead (testing and release stuff) compared to actual development time.  There is not much time for software design in such a scheme, there is always a rush to hit the next two week time click.  Longer term projects are tougher to schedule and short term thinking dominates.  \r\nThe performance policy is that anyone who, if they quit, would not be attempted to talk out if it, should be fired preemptively (a hair trigger threshold for firing, basically).  This creates a chilling effect in my opinion.  I have seen fairly senior management that disagreed with their boss being (farily apparently) fired.  This creates a bit of a yes man environment, something that Netflix would deny (perhaps even to themselves).   There is very little empowement of employees in real decisions, and decision making is very top down, with the resulting motivation hit that entails."}, {"review_title": "So much potential to be a great place to work, too bad it's not.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Aug 2009", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Hillsboro, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent hourly pay,\r\nUse of the eight out at a time membership plan while employeed with Netflix,\r\nHand sanatizer readily available.", "cons": "In May 2009 Netflix took away sick/vacation hours and provided employees an additional dollar an hour pay and then advised all employees to open up their own savings account to save for unexpected days off.  Netflix does not have a policy regarding sick days so as to hold it against you when you cannot make it to work (even if you provide a doctor's note).  In nine months I called out sick twice and still received warnings not to miss work.  Netflix promotes itself as striving to have the best customer service, however has reduced it's training too only two weeks.  One week in classroom and the next week on the floor taking calls.  The training is insufficiect which leads to inconsistency on the call center floor and the information which is relayed to customers.  The turn over rate is ridiculous.  I managed to work there for nine months before my part time shift was taken away and forced to go full time.  I was not able to work full time due to childcare needs and was told that either I take the shift I am given (which is based on call volumes and business needs only) or I can quit.  Netflix refused to work out a schedule that would let me keep my job there and work with their needs as well.  Netflix anticipates doing a shift bid every six months, which means there is no gurantee you will be able to stay at the shift that you are hired for, and no room for disscussion.  So if you have small children or attend school this is not a suitable job.  Netflix promotes a no policy policy environment, which gives each individual team manager and leader to do as they see fit.  One day they will tell you you are doing a great job, the next you will be let go.  Netflix call center fired employees for not being able to make it to work due to snowstorms that hit hard in December 2008.  Roads were not plowed, public transportation was not running, and yet you were let go.  People were in accidents trying to get to work.  Other's they put up in a hotel to make sure they would make their shift.  Netflix had random mandatory OT in some cases without any notice.  It wasn't just that they required a set amount of extra hours from everyone, they only had specific hours in which had to be filled.  My husband had to take days off work so I could meet their required OT.   Again no flexiblity with regards to family needs.\r\nOverall it's just really sad because this job was and could be fun.  It's about movies and tv shows and all the great changes that are happening with the internet and instant streaming.  Still it is a call center and those jobs aren't always the best, however when the entire company is working so hard against their own employess, the job is terrible.

In contrast to many other companies where lazy and incompetent people hang around for years, Netflix tried to retain only the best and brightest people.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that's not what it was like in reality. A week after I started at Netflix, the recruiter who hired me was unceremoniously dismissed. Then the tech support guy in our office was released. Then an engineer on my team. In each of these cases, it wasn't clear what these folks had done wrong. They had all been technically competent, friendly and hard working. This promoted a culture of fear where no one felt that their job was secure.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that there were several things going on. Managers were given incentives to regularly purge employees. So, managers developed antagonistic relationships with employees. In most normal companies, a key responsibility of a manager is to defend their team in front of senior management. At Netflix, this just doesn't happen.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Netflix doesn't have adequate mechanisms for providing feedback and review to employees. (In the year I spent at Netflix, I didn't receive a single review, positive or negative.) Without a formal system for employee evaluation, managers resort to picking favorites: they hire in their friends, and fire people who they aren't friends with. I saw this happen to many different people while I was at Netflix. It's allowable by law (everyone is an \"at will\" employee), but it does not lead Netflix to hire and retain the best people.\r\n\r\nNetflix has had the good fortune to be in an easy business. They moved early into online DVD rentals, and have large cost advantages over potential rivals. Their competitors (Blockbuster, Walmart, etc) took major missteps, and were not really able to compete.

At Netflix the whole room is filled with those guys. If that intimidates you or scares you, thats a sign its not a good fit for you.

I was hired under a manager who convinced me to join Netflix (I had 24 emails from that person persuading me). However I learned after joining that I am supposed to report to a new manager and the very first day that new guy complained that I have never worked with JAVA and AWS (Then why did he agree to take me in his team in the first place ? ). Nightmare started from that very day.  He kept on mentioning the same thing every one on one. He forced me to move my position in every meeting and make sure I seat where he points me to. He will talk to all my co-workers and inform them if he is cancelling one on ones, for me he wont do anything and just disappear. He \r\nwill constantly irritate me saying how good he was when he joined. He will always shout at me and try to ignore my opinions on any damn technical stuff. I was totally terrified of him and knew that he will make sure that I fail. He tried all he could.   He gave me two projects and one project scope kept changing and changing. Still i tried to keep up and developed good relationships with other team managers, members and project managers.One day (I am sure my manager was waiting for that day) I wrote something incorrect in an email (this is my 4th month I guess). He pounded on me, and also after a 14 hour continuous on call, I took a 2 min break, he shouted at me for 15 minutes for missing a false alram ! I apologized. He tried to blame me for what I did not do and said he and someone else was watching me silently, while I was chatting with someone else about some technical issue over a group chat. So unethical !  He said some PM complained about me and when I asked for the names and examples he refused. I raised the alarm to higher management and they said it is \"his word vs mine\". One day they said they are sorry I had to go through this and next day they change the tone and said they have to believe my manager. I requested them to talk to engineers and get feedback. They refused to even do that.  I resigned the next week as I could not take the humiliation and realized that if I stay back and work in the same group, they will find some excuse to fire me. I knew all companies where I worked before were waiting to take me back any day. So I had no worry.  The funny part is the people who were working with me kept on sending me emails about how good it was to work with me and they were surprised that I left. But my manager never found anything good in me. \r\n\r\nI wish I had a better manager in NETFLIX, then I would enjoy my life there so much.

Low priced soda. Free Netflix account. I worked with (not for!) some amazing people. If your supervisor likes you, you will be treated very well and have some degree of leniency when it comes to meeting stats and time spent on the phone.", "cons": "Pretty much everything else not noted above. Most days the \"What's working?\" list is shorter than the \"What's broken?\" one.\r\n\r\nNo communication between departments. Customer service is forced to make things up because the Netflix \"engineering\" or \"research\" teams don't give any sort of information to the reps regarding estimated time to service restoration during outages. I put engineering and research in quotes because, as a CSR, you never actually speak to them. They are merely referenced, like mythology or fairy tales.\r\n\r\nReps are given goals that are nearly impossible to consistently meet, in what I believe to be a fairly obvious system that gives Netflix an opportunity to fire virtually any employee for not hitting their metrics. You basically are there by the grace of your boss, if they want to find a reason to get rid of you it will be fairly easy for them to do so.\r\n\r\nThe customer dissatisfaction is worded in such a way that many people are leaving feedback on Netflix, not the individual rep, but this DSAT number must be below a certain percentage or you risk losing your job. You are basically encouraged to burn through as many calls as quickly as possible, placating the customer or flat out lying to them (blaming their ISP, home network, or device manufacturer) enough that they'll be compelled to say that they're satisfied after you say \"please stay on the line for a one question survey\" and then promptly hang up on them. \r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no way that you are going to have consistent, quality interactions in 4:30 minutes or less, ESPECIALLY after the missteps that Netflix has made this year. But if your numbers drop, or you spend too much time trying to help out, be prepared to be \"coached\". \r\n\r\nCoaching is such an absurd term, because it implies that there is a sort of team camaraderie or human aspect. My last coaching session with my boss involved being told that I was not giving my all. I was only supposed to be a contractor for 59 days. I was supposed to have health insurance by now, and some security as an employee. Instead we are told that they can only afford to hire on so many people, and better luck next time, but you're welcome to stay on as a temp if you like! So yes, I don't really feel like giving my all. Despite putting in consistently good numbers, multiple people on my team have told me (independently) that they are afraid of being fired at any time.\r\n\r\nI get the feeling that many people are there only until they find something else. Netflix was actually a considerable pay cut from my last job, but even if the pay was higher the way they treat their employees is at the top of the list of the worst employers I've ever personally experienced. Work / life balance is non-existent. While going through some personal issues in my life, my supervisor told me to \"leave it behind me\" when I walked in the door, not offering anything close to a compassionate response.\r\n\r\nOne last observation: the people I've noticed who seem to be TRULY happy there are the ones who are too young to know any better. I'm not old by any means, but I'm also not an 18-24 year old kid who doesn't realize that jobs don't need to be like this, that you can actually be treated like a human being and be *inspired* to perform, rather than doing it because you fear for your job on a daily basis. Eventually Netflix will chew them up and spit them out, too. Ask yourself why anyone should give loyalty to a company where an employee celebrating a 6 month anniversary is considered a veteran? \r\n\r\nAlso, the positive reviews on here are probably left by Netflix management. It cites things they don't even offer anymore at the Hillsboro facility (like free mac&cheese, and, oh I dunno, BENEFITS for most of the people here). You will most likely be a temp with Netflix (meaning no benefits) until you quit or get fired.\r\n\r\nI've been lucky enough to work for some truly amazing companies, and Netflix is definitely not one of them."}, {"review_title": "Avoid this place.. its not worth it", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Oct 2017", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They have snacks and the benefits are decent", "cons": "Where to begin.. first of all they are not all inclusive,, they dont like older people such as myself to work there, also they are not diverse, i didnt see any hispanic or african american people there, only  a few.. mostly its white bread millenials..  they claim they live by their values but whoever does the hiring is seriously racist.. beforewarned they find a reason to let you go in training and if they dont like you  well then they use that \"reason\" to show you the door... do your research I wasn't the only one who they did this to.. its basically a churn and burn place  not worth it"}], [{"review_title": "Director", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 May 2018", "job_title": "Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fast paced dynamic company , great exposure and learnings .

One girl was in the classroom 5 minutes before break was over. She suddenly had a bathroom emergency, so she left quickly to take care of it. She made it back just as they were shutting the door. On the next break, she was taken aside by the supervisor (supe) who said, \"I noticed you made it back from break just as I was shutting the door. I just wanted to let you know that's unacceptable. You need to be back from break several minutes early.\" (In other words, you really don't get your full break.) She apologized, saying she'd been there five minutes early but had an emergency. He said, \"I'm sure it won't happen again.\"\r\n\r\nOne girl had to call in sick because her child gave her the flu. They forced her to speak to three different people who scolded her, the last of which was the call center manager himself! He said he was going to give her the opportunity to come in for the rest of the week. \r\n\r\nAnother girl simply asked her neighbor for a pen during class. She was pulled into a conference room afterward and told by two different supes that talking during class was unacceptable and wouldn't be tolerated. \r\n\r\nNetflix has a zero-tolerance policy for what they call \"push back\". They touched on this very briefly in class during our second week of training. The example they gave was this: \"If your supe tells you to change something and you say, 'I don't feel like it, so I'm not going to', that's considered push back and will not be tolerated.\" Basically, it's outright insubordination. My supe said I needed to work on verifying every account. When people call in, their account auto-pops onscreen....unless they don't give their service code to the automated answering service before they're transferred to a live person. This happens about half the time and it's mostly people who don't have accounts and are just asking about the service. So I asked my supe, \"Is that even when they're just calling with a general question about the website?\" He said we needed to at least ask for a name and warned me that what I'd just said was considered push back but he'd let it slide this time. I was baffled but just said, \"Okay.\" The same supe told me he liked that I was resolution oriented because that was a good thing. An hour later, he took it back saying it was bad and I needed to focus on empathy. When I was let go, they gave me the opportunity to give feedback. I mentioned the contradictions I'd noticed and also that I didn't understand how asking a simple question during training was considered \"push back\". I was told that it's all about perception and I just wasn't a right fit. They also said this sort of thing happens often.\r\n\r\nBefore you go to work for Netflix, ask yourself this: if the pay is excellent and the benefits are great, why is the turnover rate at Netflix so high??? Why are there so many bad employee reviews out there?
