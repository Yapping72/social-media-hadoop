Unfortunately this is something that they talk about very often but when situations arises, they would often side with the individual of higher rank. \r\n\r\nIn my 2 years at Netflix, I\u2019ve noticed that you don\u2019t have to be the brightest and smartest person in the room to excel in this company, you just have to be the loudest, and made your presence known in meetings especially the high visibility ones. \r\n\r\nDirectors are often bullies and brilliant jerks, somethings sans brilliant - they are great at politicking and making themselves sound and look good. \r\n\r\nThe director I am working for for example, often makes me solve director level problems. When guidance is needed the answer we get very often is \u201cnot my problem\u201d. However if the problem was successfully solved, they would be quick to claim the credit for it as the inspiration that lead the team to the breakthrough. \r\n\r\nNetflix encourages weekly 1:1s with your cross functional partners and direct managers/directors, and encourages free sharing of ideas and respectful feedback during these sessions. My director however for example would use these sessions to threaten the staff, if too many questions were asked, they would be threatened with termination. \r\n\r\nAnother issue is Netflix loves hiring very young professionals either fresh out of school or individuals on the second job. Hiring of dynamic individuals is great, however it is essential to provide young individuals with the necessary coaching to set them up for success especially when working in a high performance environment where once needs to excel and be able to separate professional and personal feelings. No coaching is provided for these young professionally immature individuals, on top of that they pay them a lot of money that probably warrants more than 10 years of experience. What happens is that these young individuals develop an inflated ego, play politics, gossip, and take everything too personally. The lack of coaching and allowing them to run amok, results in a very apparent bullying millennial mean girls/boys culture. \r\n\r\nHR is very aware of these problems but employees are often told that they are working on it, but nothing ever gets done. In fact, employees have stopped going to HR for any work issues, because more than often HR would side with the upper management, brand the victimized employee a \u201ctrouble employee\u201d and eventually they will be let go. And the reason given to the entire office for their dismissal is that they are no longer excelling in their work, which most of the time is completely false. It\u2019s almost always politics and power play involved.\r\n\r\nI have witness this happen to many times to so many of my brilliant, hardworking and true stunning colleagues. A few of these unfortunate colleagues were also told by HR upon being let go that even though they are aware of what is happening, their hands are tied and they should just treat it as they are collateral damage. \r\n\r\nHow much you get paid also depends on who you know, and how much you know how to \u201ccharm\u201d your bosses and the leadership team. I know of managers who are getting paid 3 x more than directors, because they are great with charming their bosses. How they determine how much each person gets paid, does not depend on experience, skill. It depends on friendships, and how well you sell yourself. \r\n\r\nThe money and benefits are great, but they also come at a very high cost. If you feel you are able to tolerate such an abusive environment, then this is the company for you."}, {"review_title": "Best job on the planet for work-loving, smart, competitive people", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Marketing Manager in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stunning colleague.

The one about giving candid feedback? - I have seen people complaining of behavior they literally demonstrated themselves in the following days.\r\nBut I have also seen these feedbacks resulting in tears both in the eyes of HR persons or fellow engineers. How human does that sound?\r\n\r\nHave you heard about our culture? The one about not tolerating brilliant jerks? I have nonetheless seen angriness and frustration, expressed in private, public and meeting. People rejecting new ideas by default, like, any ideas they wouldn't have worked themselves on for days wouldn't count. Even if those ideas are from the best examples in the industry or academics. How many publications/contributions have you seen from Netflix to computer science in general? How does it compare against any other company of that size in the Bay Area? Can you imagine either the real insecurity (x)or the lack of innovation that could lead to this situation?\r\n\r\nExcept for a few managers, directors or VPs feeling free enough to behave at work in the same way than how they live, almost every engineer I have been interacting with, have shared as little as possible about their private life.\r\nThe rare exceptions of interpersonal exchange ends up around some sort of competitive behavior: Who is the most geeky, sportive, owns the fastest car/biggest house/visited the strangest place.\r\n\r\nI've heard workaholic people complaining about ambitious peers who were over-managing, over-working to get even more work to do after. I feel like we're past workaholism at this point.\r\n\r\nMaybe there are a lot of shy people! Maybe there is a culture of fear, not only of being fired, but also a fear of interacting with people going to be fired.\r\nMaybe it's all in my head, maybe people giving 5 stars to their experience here don't care the human aspect of a company. And maybe they're right.\r\n\r\nWhat about your crush, your fears, your desires for the future, your appetite for life? I've been blessed to work in enough large companies to know that the behavior that I'm seeing in Netflix is not a healthy one. I've also been lucky enough to work in other industries more socializing than tech and I can tell that Netflix has a lot to do on that side, and off-sites or team meeting won't solve that problem.\r\n\r\nI am afraid about the tragic, but inevitable consequences of the ways people operate in this company: I guess that the day the worst will happen, it will be addressed in an impersonal memo by Reed; followed-up by 1 or 2 reminders during offsites. Possibly commented by HR in a Q&A document. And move on. This company seems as reactive in its management of people as it is proactive in its business operations.\r\n\r\nI still work at Netflix though, not only for the paycheck, but because I hope. I hope it will change. The needed change can't happen from a candid feedback, a Q&A, or  only from inside.\r\nChange has to come from everyone, including people who take time to read comments like this one.

Even outside the company?\r\n- Will I see emotional responses from my peers? Will that be for other reasons than being fired or bluntly criticized?\r\n- Will I find a friendly environment that will nurture my appetite for life?\r\n- What is the amount of emotional interaction (celebrating, sharing, playing) to expect from a company whose service is the best to \"entertain\"?\r\n- Do androids dream of electric sheep?"}, {"review_title": "Best company I've worked for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Ciudad de Mexico", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everything has been amazing since I joined.

Much less forthright and candid from management. For example, management recently got rid of the 5% free options. Management framed it as more choice for employees (as the 5% free options were converted to cash salary, which employees can then allocate to options if they want), but as the comp philosophy of top of market typically didn't take into account the 5% free options, employees viewed this move as management disingenuously reducing salaries by 5%.\r\n5. because there are so many more employees, career growth is much more limited (just a natural consequence of greater number of employees, more niche roles, etc.)."}, {"review_title": "Freedom & Fear", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Recruiter in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Freedom and Responsibility is the moto of the company.", "cons": "The teams and employees are still learning and growing.

This in turn creates a culture of fear where people are constantly stressing out that they are \"not doing enough\" and might be fired any minute. This also extends to the directors of teams, and when your management is stressed, it will always trickle down to create a lousy experience for you.\r\nThis makes for an extremely toxic environment at times where teams are often working on similar projects, thus competing against each other to stay relevant, which is just utter idiocy. The high pay ensures that there is way more politicking than would be needed or appropriate in such situations. This in turn can have a very demoralizing effect on the peons doing the actual work, who often feel compelled to work on nights, weekends and public holidays for goals that are often vague, and projects that are often shelved. The most insidious effect of this is observed when people contemplate taking PTO, when many employees have told me that they weren't able to relax or take as much time off as they needed, as they were constantly wondering what would happen to their jobs, and whether or not they were doing enough to \"deserve\" time off. If you've never felt this, it's a rotten state of mind, and you will feel it quite a bit here.\r\nMany times, I've felt the need to quit the field altogether, but the money and my team makes me stay for now, so I'll likely stay till my team changes.\r\n\r\nMoral of the story here is: You'll get paid a lot. You'll also likely be laid off sooner than you expect. You'll also likely make a LOT less at your next place.

It also is whatever anyone in Senior Leadership or HR says that it is to achieve whatever reorg or budget shortfall that's coming.\r\n- There's no upward mobility and very little that goes into training/development. Raises are non-existent unless you go get an offer from elsewhere, in which case you're playing Russian Roulette with the \"Keeper Test.\" \r\n- Redundancy.

I am 'lucky' to not to have kids, just a very supportive partner, and I still feel like the worst person ever at least 1-2 days per week (as I just always cancel outings with my partner and/or friends because of work).

Simple, indisputable example: you can't decide how much you make, yourself. That's an obvious statement, yet it proves there definitely are no-goes and as such, gray areas.

You want X number of monitors, Y super-amazing-computer, come in at 11am, leave at 4pm, take numerous vacations, ask (and receive a real answer!) dang near anything about what movies/shows they're secretly bidding on in Hollywood, etc, etc. Not only things a reasonable person would want to do/have, more like a well spoiled person. This all assumes you are communicating this with your team and performing well above average--Netflix does *not* knowingly hire junior, mid-level, or wannabe-senior engineers. I haven't personally seen a bunch of people get fired, but of the one or two I've seen, it was not surprising. I have noticed some teams are more critical of performance than others.\r\n\r\nLike any company of a decent size, not every team has exactly the same culture. Mine was absolutely wonderful day-to-day. My managers help you and coordinate, more than \"manage\" me, which is huge just by itself. To this point, most engineering managers I know of aren't really programmers, which I think is a huge bonus because there is far less risk of them wanting to micromanage projects and implementation details. That said, they are ALL very very technical and  can fairly trivially smell BS.\r\n\r\nSalary: you'll be more than happy as far as I've heard from co-workers.
