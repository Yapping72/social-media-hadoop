Next, coming in as a contractor you don't have say on company performance and improvement despite doing the same things as a direct.

Where to start. The Health care system you start out with isn\u2019t as great as what people think. You can only use it after 90 passing days of having it, and only on your self for as long as you are temporary worker. No family members and such for as long as you are a temp. \r\n\r\nThe pay raise is yet again applicable only when you get hired in which to my experience is about a year or more after you become a temp. Yes They say after 90 work days but there are Major caveats with that like you not calling in for any reason At all and going to work no matter the situation. Tornado outside? You go to work. You feel sick? You go to work. \r\nThey will excuse you for those days On record. But they also have this internal system they call the \u201cattendance program\u201d. You get in it you are not getting hired in until years down the line no matter the situation. Keep missing days for any logical reason to get in it. Simple as that. \r\n\r\nThe people you meet there are for the most part good to work with. They help out they like talking and on. It\u2019s mostly black folks so you are going to have a more chilling time in my experience. But then there are the big bosses. The UAW Stewart\u2019s, the Nurses, and the HR. They are all completely useless. The UAWs only job is to treat you like how a lawyer treats his patient but instead they treat you like a work machine, you call them and tell them you Have a problem with your house flooding, they will say something \u2018brave\u2019 like \u201cnot enough people were in this situation, (60%of the work force) so you will get a point on your record\u201d. Absolutely useless. The nurses don\u2019t do anything other than give you some mint which can help with your throat hurting. Other then that they ask you what you need in order to feel better. So, you Are the nurse. The HR is the usual. Has the name Human Resource written all over them but need to add C at the beginning to be more accurate and call them what they are, Corporate Human Resources. They ones gave me a point because I went to celebrate a Religious holiday. Then they told me they wanted a written letter. How is that even possible to get a written letter for a Religious holiday?My friend had it the worse. His grandma died and had to attend the funeral like any normal person would. They told him they needed written proof that she had died. And then there is corporate. \r\n\r\nThey Don\u2019t care if you had died the next day. They don\u2019t care if you believe in a religion. They don\u2019t care your car has stopped or got pulled over. You are a lawn to them. As a temp you will obay their work schedule When ever they need you. You have been working tirelessly to the bone for a full week and now you are told to report on a Sunday for midnight shift. Only to come back home and only have enough time to sleep, wake up, and go to work on a Monday. For those who like that no offense. but I have something most people have and that is a life, with hobbies. Your not the only ones who want to go golfing this afternoon corporate. People have actual families. I can only imagine the time lost with the family if I dare have one."}], [{"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Mechanic in Palo Alto, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people at their jobs", "cons": "Nothing bad to say about the."}, {"review_title": "Finance", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Finance Manager in Brampton, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stability environment and vehicle program is available", "cons": "High pressure environment, culture is resistant to change with market competition, you keep doing the same things."}, {"review_title": "good place to start not to stay", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Process Reliability Manager in Warren, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good people to work with at times", "cons": "Upper management has lots to learn about keeping employees happy"}, {"review_title": "I have enjoyed working here", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Brand Controller in Slough, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A fun environment and very dynamic", "cons": "Not totally regulated and can do with improving standard operating procedures"}, {"review_title": "Work culture", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Big company will give confidence", "cons": "Poor management cuz all were engineers that got promoted."}, {"review_title": "Salary", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Production", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I guess it's a Decent wage", "cons": "Slow progression to max pay"}, {"review_title": "One of the Best for learners", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Dec 2021", "job_title": "NVH CAE Lead in Chennai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Environment\r\nLots of oppurtunity to learn", "cons": "Not much experienced people available for regional product development\r\nSome Managers doesn't have good manegerical behaviour."}, {"review_title": "A decent place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Welder in Rockford, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay, good benefits, union", "cons": "terrible management, some jobs are extremely hard, long hours, very little transparency from the company"}, {"review_title": "Stuck in the 90's with Outdated Processes and Methodologies", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Feature Owner in Auburn Hills, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- FCA has great benefits\r\n- Co-workers are nice and mostly easy to work with\r\n- The company tried their best to prevent the layoff of full-time employees due to Covid-19\r\n- Company office is great- when we were in the office", "cons": "- UNORGANIZED is an understatement\r\n- Feature Owner role does not have a job description\r\n- Feature Owner expected to babysit, Project Manage, and while other roles do nothing. \r\n- Leadership thinks and operates in silos\r\n- Department wants to be agile but encourages and only thinks in Waterfall\r\n- All the work is done in MS Word/Google Drive instead of Jira\r\n- Lack of communication from Management \r\n-CR process is ridiculous and not really a CR process, it just an excuse for Product Managers to get something they wanted that doesn't improve customer experience.\r\n- Everyone is focused on what GM is doing instead of identifying what the customers wants and needs are.\r\n- Lack of accountability for Development teams.

You're a second class citizen and expected to work OT with no compensation with the carrot of \"a direct position is available for you if you just work harder\". No. This is not the case. You can work as hard as you want, but you'll never get that coveted position unless you know someone. \n\nDirect employees are subject to serious politics. There's no way to do your job unless you have exceptional relationships built around the starbucks on site or the smoking booth. Just doing your job and getting all your deliverables out is not enough.\n\nExpectations are a 60 hour work week. Anything less than 45 hours is frowned upon, unless you're a \"golden child\" who can get away with 35 hours a week or less. Meetings can start at 7 am and then you can have ones that also start at 5 pm.\n\nWomen and minorities are looked upon with suspicion. A woman must work three times as hard as their male counterparts to get the same compensation and kudos. Top brass is all white men. \n\nSexism, bullying, and micromanagement are tolerated and encouraged. Many trump supporters work there with views that they spew into the cube farm with absolutely no repercussions. \n\nMiddle management gets away with hiring only young women or young men as the case may be. If you don't fit that description (helps if you're blonde and under 25 for one group), you'll be treated horribly, having things you could do yourself yanked away and you'll have to go through someone else to do a large portion of your job.\n\nWorking from home is only for some people, not others. The culture is very \"rear end in seat\" and even if you get all your work done at home on a WFH day, you will not get recognized. It's funny how those people are wholly unavailable during their WFH time don't have any repercussions, but if you aren't available from 0630 to 1800, you get yelled at.\n\nCompensation is low, unless you're higher than middle management. The people that do the work don't get paid well. Make sure you negotiate what you'll be happy with for at least 5 years or else, because you won't get any increases at all. Oh, and if you do negotiate from contract to employee, you'll have a target on your back. \n\nIf you do get a job here, work but also keep searching. There are many other companies that will pay more for less work and fewer politics. Don't stay for more time than your 401k takes to vest. Learn as much as you can but try to stay out of the politics unless you want to move somewhere. Do your job, get paid, and then go home.

Having all of your hours and days taken from you for months at a time. Working 1 day a week or less. Forcing you to seek a second job.\r\n4. Turning around and mandating that you work 6 or 7 days a week with less than 24 hours notice and no consideration for the schedule of the second job you were forced to pick up. \r\n5. Giving 2.5 hours worth of pay to the union every single month to be told part-time employees do not have rights and refusing to help you.\r\n6. Being removed from a job and placed on another job, at any time, for any reason\r\n7. Getting less than 5 minutes of training on a job (when you are suppose to have 4 HOURS) and then being reprimanded if you make mistakes.\r\n8. Management will accidentally mark you absent or forget to pay you for a holiday and it will take months to correct. \r\n9. If you are a part-time employee you do not have seniority. Regardless of it being a UAW seniority shop. This ends up leading to abuse of employees and a lot of favoritism because they can do whatever they please. \r\n10. You are provided health insurance as a part-time worker but it is sub par and you will not receive dental, vision, premium health care, PTO, vacation, bonuses or any type of benefits until you are full time. \r\n11. It can, and for most people, will take anywhere from 3-6 YEARS before you achieve a full-time status.\r\n12. It will take years to achieve a full time status BUT you will be forced to work full time hours with none of the benefits.\r\n13. As a part time employee you will be working more hours than most full time employees. However, you will not get a piece of the profit-sharing pie.\r\n14. The union will side with management 9/10\r\n15. If you are sick you still have to report to work and then ASK to be sent home. If you do not APPEAR sick enough they will tell you NO. A doctors note will be considered an unexcused absence.\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, I'm bored.

Learning opportunities : The organisation is an open library and the global counterparts are always willing to help. Learning in this organisation is vested upon the individual and it is also team specific.\r\n\r\n2. No discrimination between onroll and offrole employees. \r\n\r\n3. Cab facility is a plus for people coming from different parts of the city.", "cons": "1. Employee respect : Employees will be treated like slaves, every action of the management speaks for itself. Treatment of employees is based on favourism of the management.\r\n\r\n2. Work : Only a few teams work program specific whilst majority of them act as support team for other global regions. Whilst a few work very hard, this organisation allows many to slouch without doing any work. Work life balance takes a toll for people who out heart and soul into work, but end of the day get no credit or the compensation.\r\n\r\n3. Compensation : Easily this organisation is in the bottom in terms of compensation amongst all the automotive OEM in India. There's no defined process for hike cycle, in the last 3years employees have received one hike of 5% for the year 2018. Salary parity between employees is huge and there's no standardization. Employees working in this organisation for long term often have the worst salaries in the market. Bonus is a key highlight of the offer, apart from being an addition to the CTC offered, in reality the bonus. \r\n\r\n4. Employee Retention : Even the best of employees are not retained/ not a single effort is taken to retain the employee. Asking for a salary rise is often considered rude/frowned upon eventhough one deserves it.\r\n\r\n5. Management : No one in the organisation knows who the management is. The blame game happens between managers' and HRs', ultimately no one takes decision.\r\n\r\n6. Planning : Things take a comical turn interms of planning, employees share laptops/PC's/chairs/storage compartments in shifts. WFH during locking was a chaos, weekly return to office mail even before the new office was fully constructed was a comical taunting. \r\n\r\n7. Trainings : No formal trainings, fresher induction in place in comparison to other Automotive OEM's. Don't be shocked if one is put to work the very first day.\r\n\r\n8. Growth potential : Any individual will be allowed to grow based on the favouritism showed by the manager. The only growth potential is onroll, onsite visits (cutback due to covid) and position(if available). Do not expect to grow financially in this organisation.\r\n\r\nEnd Note : \r\nThis organisation is best suited for :\r\n1. Intermediate jumps in career/ short-term stay.\r\n2. Someone who is looking to settle down in their career.\r\n3. For overtly enthusiastic individual who are willing to learn."}, {"review_title": "Good benefits but questionable culture", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Supply Chain in Auburn Hills, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pto, medical, vehicle discounts are some of the best", "cons": "Inconsistent company culture and focus on employee engagement.
