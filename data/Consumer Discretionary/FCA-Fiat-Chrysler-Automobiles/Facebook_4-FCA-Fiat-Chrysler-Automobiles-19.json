Like CPE credits, Six Sigma classes, harvard business classes.", "cons": "Some middle leadership shield the truth of what employees think to senior leadership which prevents the higher up managers from really making a change to culture. The company is still very political. The promotions are based on political factors, not your experience or ability. They FIRE NO ONE. Once your in, its easily two years of bad reviews before they let you go. They would rather force people out. Problem being , if your making good money and you are bad at your job, why leave if you are only working 10-4 everyday. While the good workers pick up that extra work, pad their resumes and leave for other opportunities. This leaves the company with alot of \"waste bodies\" or people who add no value. \r\n\r\nA major complaint of mine is that some managers judge you by how long your in the office. so they promote work life balance, but if your not in the office 7am-8pm everyday, then they just wont promote you. This penalizes the more efficient people who can handle their work in 40 hours. Alot of promotions are just managers trying to get rid of their bad seeds. If they have someone in their group that under performs, they will give them an average review so that they can get them out of their group. These people get promoted to roles that they have no business being in. Some managers, maybe 70%, have NO CLUE what their team actually does. I have heard managers tell me \"I'll let this person tell you how this process goes because I am too far removed from it\".  I worked in a group for 4 years where only 5 of the 25 people on the team were relied on. If someone left at 2pm, we picked up their work with nothing being said to them.\r\n\r\nThey talk alot about driving change, but when it comes time too, no one makes a decision. Everyone, no matter how little the decision is, just wants to pass it up to their manager, who passes it up to their manager. Lots of wasted time waiting for people to make decisions. You spend 2 weeks preparing spreadsheets and PPTs and then you never hear about those again. \r\n\r\nALSO, VERY IMPORTANT**** come in at a high salary because they DO NOT adjust you for the job you move to. If you are promoted, you get a small bump. If you move laterally, you get a smaller bump or maybe no bump at all. They tell you its \"good experience\" rather than pay you appropriately. most you get is around 6%. With around 5-6 levels of management between the bottom and the CFO, it doesnt leave room for alot of \"promotions\"."}, {"review_title": "district sales mgr", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "13 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Sales Manager in Montreal, QC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "team work , good products , alway s proud of my company . very good relation with my dealers . good understanding from the direction . always high respect from the direction . motivation very high .", "cons": "very competitive market from others car and truck company . always very high theck . i was always at my best , very demanding . improvement is always a must . stress always at the maximum"}, {"review_title": "Could be better could be worse", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Aug 2011", "job_title": "Senior Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice facility.

Starting with the fact many managers are promoted on what they have done and not what they can do.  They receive little to no training in people management and quickly get a feeling of seniority which they think entitles them to demean others and boss them around.  When something goes wrong senior management only goes to the manager and of course things roll down hill to the lower staff.  \n\nCertain individuals in senior management have taken it upon themselves to find and correct these issues but it is a slow work in process.\n\nThe biggest complaint I here is work life balance.  It almost seems standard for most to work until the earlier evening.  It seems management confuses an employees willingness to work long hours as being equivalent to career drive and commitment.  This is a dangerous precedent to set. \n\nTypically improving processes is a good thing, however here is just means that instead of going home at a regular time you need to step up and fill in for others who can't do their job.\n\nThe big issue is the lack of internal communication which leads to many fire drills and stressful situations. Usually, these fire drills are the result of employee turnover and the new employees don't know what needs to be done until after the fact.  This is where managers need to step in and help but that happens few and far between.  \n\nOverall though, some in management recognize there is a problem and are trying to fix it.

It takes 10 minutes to walk from the lot and through the building, so that\u2019s 100 minutes a week I\u2019m not getting paid for.  There has been (most likely) intentional damage to competitor vehicles parked in these lots.\r\n\r\nZero career education / improvement or travel\r\n\r\nFew perks.

I figured out they are using tpts only to keep the plant up and running, on the 89th day they\u2019re fired, after your first week you\u2019re not promised a set schedule whatsoever at all, it\u2019s pretty much standby, they will literally have you working 4 hour days and random 10 hour Saturdays and this that and the 3rd, you will most likely never get OT, you\u2019re told if you\u2019re ever late you\u2019re fired, and they will. This isn\u2019t a career, it\u2019s another company that has gone full bs and stooped down to lying to employees and causing bs because they can just get more like there aren\u2019t enough already. You\u2019re benefits are pretty much useless. They\u2019re going to teach you all about FCA but not tell you in the contract that the older employees gave up A LOT of benefits they were promised back but never got. They aren\u2019t worried about rolling you over permanently unless you already have a trade. Theres talk about closing the plant and they don\u2019t know when but we know they do and we know how this goes.

Everyone there possesses a strong sense of determination in getting the job done.  There is a sense of pride amongst your colleagues at what can be accomplished and you are surrounded by very talented people that you learn from and work with everyday.  Over the last decade the auto industry has been a difficult place to work with all of the global competition, cost cutting and challenges that are present in this industry.

Now, this is common for many businesses, but Chrysler has been extremely slow in addressing these issues with tools to aid the employee.  Laptops,cell phones, flextime, offsite connectivity, internet connection at work and alternative work arrangements/schedules have been extremely slow to develop, if at all.    Management is done at a distance and blanketed across everyone.  Very little that is filtered up to improve operations is recognized or investigated.

Impossible tasks are coupled with too little support and too few resources to remain competitive with outside firms.  \r\n\r\nManagement doesn't do an adequate job of setting up the organization for success.  Too many talented people are doing jobs that bring little value to the organization.  Simple reorganization of departments or deployment of specialized skills from those who possess them could provide so many benefits to the cost structure,morale, productivity,etc. that it is surprising that this hasn't been addressed. \r\n\r\nToo much is expected from the employee, yet too little is expected from management. At one point, a third party consulting firm conducted an internal survey which revealed that Chrysler was more than 50% understaffed for the amount of work required to keep current operations moving.  Chrysler has not been profitable for many years,however we still had senior management level mgrs. in the mgt. bonus structure (40% -100% of annual pay) reaping the rewards of a successful co. The subordinates of the senior managers typically went without merit increases, had increased annual benefit contributions and worked excessive overtime to receive an average rating on appraisals  This contributed to a strong divide between the working class and management within the organization.

It was Challenging and very rewarding at times. Always felt great to beat more seasoned veterans at anything.  Many great colleagues across the country to learn from and interact with. Many interesting characters in the dealerships. In my experience, five years of this job gives you at least double that in stories.  The best part:  if you're a decent person, you can really make a difference with customers.", "cons": "Simply put:  the business centers run like bad dealerships.  Separation between sales and parts and service is very irritating. Sales area managers get more pay, more perks, better field cars that they often get to choose, more recognition, fewer (often half) dealers to call on, and the business center directors actually know their names. A parts and service area manager is known as \"you\" most of the time whilst being ordered to take notes or fetch coffee or something else that a corporate agent shouldn't be doing. Again these things are similar to a poorly run dealership. Through all of this you're told that you're equal to your sales counterparts. \r\nVery confusing \"direction\" from middle management is a daily occurrence. Most of the time it seems like you'll do better if you have no short term memory.  If something is the right thing to do today, it won't be tomorrow or perhaps two hours from now. \r\nEveryone's job is constantly threatened. This gets worse when it's end of quarter and you're called up to to one of the regional offices for a week. The subliminal as well as blatant harassment gets worse at these times. Through all of this you're still supposed to sell thousands and thousands in slightly discounted parts. \r\nYour district can make or break you no matter how good you really are. I've seen them even tailor a district to someone they really want to succeed. Then during your next sit-down they tell you how much better than you the person is that's been there six months. You'll receive criticism without suggestions for improvement at the same time. \r\nThere is constant micromanaging. This is very abusive and the boss tells you you're making him do this to you. You'll get personal phone calls where they talk to you as if you are the cause of all the problems and only you. The funny part is if you call your colleagues an hour later, they got the exact same phone call. There is no honesty or positive motivation. The only tactic seems to be negative reinforcement. \r\nThere were Loads of Sexist and racist comments including a few directed at me. If history is any indicator, HR wouldn't return my call about that either. \r\nHR is often the boogeyman.  My boss actually blamed them for a bad review I had. He claimed to have nothing to do with any of it. It was HR and the head of Mopar. Exaggerations and lies might pop up on a review. If they want you to look bad you will and vice versa. If you're a good employee, but someone doesn't like you, it's \"Performance Improvement Plan\" time. This has become more and more of a trend with them. It caused us to lose some good people. If you pass you're put on another. One guy I knew was on a pip for a year. I have also heard of multiple pips over years from others. \r\nNot many of us received raises or promotions really for 5 years. We did get a diminishing bonus system that no one really understood. If one did get a promotion, it meant more responsibility and stress...not pay.  Some of our people were promoted to doing what used to be three people's jobs. \r\nEvery meeting and review is a beating and very adversarial. We had two people that could do no wrong. The rest of us were apparently the incompetent scum of the earth.  These beatings can lead to personal attacks. At the end of a quarterly beating, my boss concluded with \"I just hope you're not disappointing your father.\"  This was in his fake sad/caring voice. \r\nIn the end it was the sales focus that led me to leave the company.  There was less and less focus on helping dealers become more efficient and therefore create happy customers. We were all about quick parts sales. This is something we told dealers to never do or they could lose customers. This led to many bad deals. Dealers were promised things for cooperating that they weren't given. \r\nThrough all of this, your expense reports aren't being paid on time. I was told that they would be paid promptly. That's in a nutshell what working relationships are like there.  Your immediate boss lies to you over and over because eventually you'll believe it. This is how they try to constantly manipulate you.  If he was mad at you...good luck getting anything paid. So then you're paying for the 1000 miles of travel expenses you do in a week. \r\nIf you decide to leave the company, you have another fight on your hands. They tell you when you leave that you have to pay off your corporate card or you won't get your final paycheck...illegal. They also tell you you'll get your paycheck at the next pay period...you won't...also illegal. You have to nearly harass your \"friendly\" HR Representative to get it.  \r\nMy favorite part about leaving was the paperwork I \"had\" to (didn't) sign. Said papers were stating I agreed not to say anything unpleasant about them or try to peruse them legally.  They even said they'd fire me if I didn't sign.  It seemed a fitting end to all of this."}, {"review_title": "Looking back", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "23 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Auburn Hills, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good pay , benefits ,opportunity to growth and advancement , meaning you can \"build\"  the best position that is for you.You have the liberty to be proactive and make a difference", "cons": "Is still a winer.Be prepare to \"divorce \" and get \"marry\" many time..Go trough much turmoil .Same thing.over and over.\r\n\r\nOnly the \"strong\"survvei.But of course every person is different and the experience is diferent.It is up to you to make it the best or the worst."}, {"review_title": "Product Planning", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Motivated and passionate people proud of their work and the company.

Just creates mass confusion bc there is a gap between shifts so no communication. They refuse to hire enough supervisors to sufficiently do the job, so management gets worked to death. And they don't care, they will just kick your carcass to the curb and bring the next warm body in. Turn over rate is extremely high, I've never seen anything like it in my career. I've never seen so many people go out on stress leave either and it's due to the extreme amount of hours and work load. It's very easy to see what the problem is but this company refuses to acknowledge the problem and fix it. And with AWS, you lose about half your holidays too. So if July 4th doesn't fall on your day you work, you do not get that as a holiday!! What kind of company does that to it's people!! They do not promote people based on talent, they backfill people bc they quit from extreme stress or they move someone into a job bc the previous guy \"couldn't handle it\". Upper management is extremely disconnected from the amount of work load the Unit Leads and Business Unit Leaders have. If you try to put in for a job opening, they block you from taking it even if it's the direction you want to take your career path. People are not allowed to take other jobs inside the company, you are shoved wherever they want you to go and you aren't asked to go, you are told where you go. It's completely backwards from top level companies. And they try to act like WCM is part of the culture, it's not. World Class Manufacturing becomes important when an audit comes around every 6 months so they can get a score. Then after the audit, back to the old Chrysler.
