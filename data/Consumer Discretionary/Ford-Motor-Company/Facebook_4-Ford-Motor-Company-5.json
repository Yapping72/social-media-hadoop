Most incidents go unreported because it's common knowledge that HR will do nothing and there WILL be retaliation in some form.  This company only cares about their public image and how that helps them make more money.  Deep down they don't care one bit about having a happy and productive work force, profits come first.  Management ignores constructive criticism and feedback from it's employees.  Most coworkers have the same complaints you do but are afraid to speak up and rightly so, dissent of any form is not tolerated.  It's like living George Orwell's \"1984\".  All office buildings are old, crumbling and moldy.  The UAW is a pain to deal with.  They have fewer responsibilities, few qualifications and get paid more than most educated engineers.
