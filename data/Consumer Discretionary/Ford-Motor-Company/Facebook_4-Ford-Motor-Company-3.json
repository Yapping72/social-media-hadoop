You go to medical/physical therapy during your shift (while still getting paid) as someone covers your job for you to do so. There's fun union activities at the union hall/out in the community for your family. Holiday parties, trunk-or-treat, employee appreciation picnics, etc. If you surround yourself with the right people, you can create a great support system/community/extended family for you and your family.", "cons": "Very strange factory \"culture\". Tons of negativity, gossip, drugs, harassment, favoritism, manipulation, and taking advantage of people. You're best to go to work, not socialize with most, and head home straight after. This isn't all there is of course, but it's overwhelmingly THE culture there. They've only been hiring temps the past few years, not hiring them full-time for years. You only know the max length of your shift, but time varies daily and you don't know what time your shift ends until after halfway through your shift each day. People take advantage (on a whole other level) of any and every loophole they can find, in every single policy resulting in VERY divided and bitter co-workers and regular policy change to try to combat these issues. You have to save your vacation time to use during shut down bc each year. The parking lots are huge and you must get to work very early in order to park, walk through the turnstiles, and inside the building to wherever your specific job may be. There are security guards in the lots but there's still quite a bit of vandalism, theft, and just plain \"working hazard\" damage done to vehicles by people dropping screws and other things in the parking lots. Lots of flat tires for sure. Open drug/alcohol abuse in parking lots on breaks and in between shifts, so it's a difficult place for many to remain sober (without a very good plan ahead of time.) I imagine most factories of this size all having similar issues, but this is the only one I've worked at so I've got nothing to compare it to other than what I've heard from others. There's no a/c, but there is heat for a couple months in mid winter. It's a very loud environment, and an extremely monotonous and boring job that begins breaking your body down fairly early on with all the repetition. The pay is so high because they understand what you're giving up when you work there. You're ultimately trading your quality of life for a higher paycheck and better benefits, but by the time you make it to retirement your body is going to be hurting so much you won't be able to enjoy things as you would've if you'd worked elsewhere. That being said, you'll have the money to do things you wouldn't have been able to if you'd worked elsewhere. Figure out your priority, health or money; it's definitely a trade-off there. I honestly don't believe there's a way to have both if you work there your entire career. Possibly switching jobs frequently to limit repetitive motion injuries, staying ahead of probable injuries and taking extremely good care of your body, and finding ways to take time off through the year to give your body a much needed break to recuperate are the only ideas I can come up with that might help reach that goal of trying to have both."}], [{"review_title": "Good company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Calibration Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance, benefit, people", "cons": "None none none none none"}, {"review_title": "Feels like family", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Group Financial Controller in Melbourne", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Investment in development including job rotations, plus had nothing but great support from my team and leaders", "cons": "Tough work environment, long hours at times but it is a competitive industry so need to put in the effort"}, {"review_title": "It\u2019s alright", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Lube Technician in Oxnard, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They \u201cbuy you tools\u201d because if you bring your own they\u2019d have to pay you double minimum", "cons": "They take forever to get you what you need if you even get it"}, {"review_title": "ford", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 May 2021", "job_title": "Sales Associate in Hamilton, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "none that I can think of", "cons": "low base rate and pay"}, {"review_title": "Pvt Engineer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Pvt Engineer in Taoyuan", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Collaborative environment , encouraging to share opinions and fair reward system", "cons": "unclear R&R and difficult to get promotion to certain level (low turnover in management levels)"}, {"review_title": "Ok to Grow", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "11 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Engineer in Ciudad de Mexico", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is ok to learn and grow", "cons": "Not long term carrier opportunities"}, {"review_title": "Politics", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "12 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Ambitious for new vehicle programs, which results in staying busy.", "cons": "Internal politics drive promotions and some folks working with fear that their career can depend on who sees them favorably."}, {"review_title": "Software Engineer at Ford Research and Innovation Center (Palo Alto, CA)", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Software Research Engineer in Palo Alto, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Great work environment with great people\r\n- Not a whole lot of red tape (Palo Alto office only, HQ can be full of red tape)\r\n- Many opportunities to work on cool projects (feels almost too flexible at times).
