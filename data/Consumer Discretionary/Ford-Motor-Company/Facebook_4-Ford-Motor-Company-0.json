Building a new campus.", "cons": "Most everything: 1. The art group known as Studio has more leeway than any group in the company, and is the prime reason the company is struggling so much. They dont have to follow most company rules or standards. They cause most of the companies problems and throw away most of the work and effort of the company internal and downstream of them which is practically everyone. 1a. Studio is where reveal leaks happen because of their carelessness 1.b Studios unprofessionalism forces every department after them to clean up their work and sloppiness with data, deliverables, and the like. 1c. Studio and Ford \"benchmark\"......copy.......most of their work from other company vehicles. Their only unique successes of late are F-150 Raptor, bronco, and maverick. And the Bronco was a copy and past of old vehicle mixed with jeep wrangler. Maverick was a little too but finally felt like someone was finally breaking the benchmark safety bumpers. Everything else is just a frakensteins monster of other companys vehicles.....a little of this , a lot of that. 1d. Studio isnt exactly the cream of the crop or most effective bunch, but they are treated like all-stars in the company because of nostalgia for the old ways. 2.Engineering department is an after thought to studio at Ford. If the execs and upper managers could replace all or most of engineering with automation, software, or machines to make a square peg fit (terrible studio design/theme) in a round hole (vehicle architecture/package limitations.....they would. It would just be execs and Studio in their perfect little business world. 3. Everything at Ford has to constantly be changed all at the same time. New software support systems (not the old main systems because they are too engrained in company process and costly to change), new forced mid day software updates, new car features, new tech, new platforms, new everything, new updates to process mid program stream, new employees, new shifting job roles to manage the reorganization changes......etc,etc,etc! 3A. Perpetual chaos with ever changing project requirements and timeframe changes, that are claimed to never be allowed to change unless you blow past final release date. 4. Execs that tell you to break the bureacracy molds while your immediate manager/supervisor tells you to stick to the mold or else your job, your performance review and your bonus will be affected. 4. Managers that have been in the Chaos so long they cant seem to communicate a rational thought to others, have mo people skills, or have some work PTSD. 4b. Finger twiddling managers you have to tell to do their job of giving you a performance review or following up with you for additional assignments or direction. 4c. Managers that change every year minimum, or 4 to six months. Making your performance reviews worthless. 5. 30 year to 40 year veterans pushed out of company that held the design, engineer, and manufacturing process together because little was written down and the process never followed because it fails. 5A. Wasnt written down so people could keep their job longer, now being forced out anyway without SOPs, and daily SOPs written down...... Design GPDS process is all Ford needs LOL! 5B. There is what the GPDS process says to do and then what everyone actually does. 6. Company split by divisions and they dont communicate effectively at all ever so good luck with better systems design faster. 6a. Company split up so many ways including now ICE and EV, with most people leaving and laid off from ICE(money source) to pay for EV (money drain). 7. You can get a degree with Ford college STAP program, but good luck getting a new position or promotion in the company with it.....lol. 7A. Hiring position changes is chaos now.

Most LL6 supervisors were promoted after proving they could handle a project, which somehow translates to leadership readiness - this is a mistake and has ruined careers for so many employees.

Heck, sometimes they throw in a bit of incivility to spice things up! Not kidding. Don't get me wrong; a few people leaders are really good, but a lot of them need leadership coaching and therapy. Most employees leave because of this alone and it's well known outside of Ford. \n\n- Pay is decent but isn't competitive enough to keep talent at Ford. The auto discount isn't great compared to competitors. \n\n- Bias and favoritism is soul-sucking and in your face. You have to know someone or align yourself with a leader who will fight for your career growth. Otherwise, be prepared to get the promotion/comp runaround for many years. Your people leader will say you aren't ready for a leadership role and will hold you back for many reasons, despite your experience, references, and readiness to move up.

Different shifts (after the 2 year mark) that can cater to anybodys lifestyle.", "cons": "As of 5-28-2022, (different contracts may change this) and regarding only the Chicago Assembly Plant, When starting work, you are considered a TFT (Temporary Full Time). This means you have no leniency until you pass the 2 year max mark of being a TFT and are automatically converted to Full Time, or if a new contract is set in place and you are automatically turned over. This also means you are treated like garbage by anybody who has been converted to full time, or who doesn\u2019t work for the UAW Union and works directly for Ford. You can\u2019t ever be late, or you\u2019ll be fired. You can\u2019t take any off time in these 2 years unless you have a bulletproof excuse with all of your bases covered. You cannot get a raise while being a TFT. You don\u2019t get insurance or any benefits besides the A plan until the 90th day worked. Not \u201c90 days after hire\u201d but actually 90th day worked, which comes out to be around your 6th month of working. You don\u2019t get holiday pay until you pass the 90th working day.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be many layoffs right now, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it, because of the constant parts shortages that have to plagued the world since 2020. You also can\u2019t file for unemployment while being under your 90th working day.\r\n\r\nManagers don\u2019t seem to know any questions you ask them, since you work for Fords Union, and they work for Ford directly. So information on any topic you need to know about is incredibly hard to get, and could take weeks or months to find simple things out. Even the people who work for the Union who should know this information most of the time don\u2019t, because when they got hired in, TFTs were not a thing, therefore they mostly know nothing about what a TFT can and can\u2019t do.\r\n\r\nOrientation is mostly all bs. There may have been only 1 or 2 correct things learned in orientation, but other than that, it\u2019s almost all just copy and paste phrases they legally need to tell you. Once you get on the floor, pretty much everything they told you about goes out the window. (Besides *some* of the safety tips they told you.)\r\n\r\nWork life balance is pretty awful. Especially as a TFT. Once you turn full time you will work about 4 days a week which is nice, but as a TFT you work 5-6 days a week. Great pay, terrible work/life balance though. \r\n\r\nThey will ask you if you want to work on your off day or not, but if too many people decline the offer, they force everyone to work anyway.\r\n\r\nAt the Chicago Assembly plant specifically, when starting, you will be sent the the \u201cSho Center\u201d which isn\u2019t the Chicago Assembly Plant.
