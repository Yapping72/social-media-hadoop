You get to try out positions you pick.  You may pick almost anything you want, but with some controls.  i.e. not all Ford positions are available.  Only those whose manager is open to having an FCG work for them.  Also, if two or more people vie for one position, only one of those people gets it.  The rest go with their 2nd, 3rd, or 4th choices.\r\n\r\nFCG Program gives you a way to evaluate Ford and for Ford to evaluate you.  FCG Program allows this to happen much faster than if you were hired directly into Ford outside of the FCG program.  The Program also gives you opportunities to move fields on a whim, where otherwise you would more likely stay in your general chosen area.", "cons": "FCG program is there to try things at Ford, but one can potentially overshoot themselves and fail.  i.e. it is possible to select a position you are not qualified for and currently there are no controls to avoid that situation. This is on purpose.  You get to try things at Ford, you pick the positions, and it feels like you are in control.\r\n\r\nBut you need to be mindful that while you are selecting and working your positions, Ford management and HR watch your performance levels and if they drop too low, may take action.  HR trumps FCG Program.\r\n\r\nThat means you cannot truly \"try a position\".   You need to use care in selecting your rotations and you need to be able to do the job well, or else you may find yourself being released from the program and back into the wild.  FCG advisors will guide you, but they will not always caution you on your selection, or be able to help you when things get really tough.\r\n\r\nNot all rotations end up being the way they were stated on paper.  For example, a highly technical role may end up being doing research on a software package and putting together a software configuration document.  Or a technical developer role where you expect to write code may end up being a usability analyst where you do research instead.\r\n\r\nA lot of roles are ambiguous, because Ford work is ambiguous.  There is lots of overhead -meetings & paperwork, to figure out what to do, and things change, so it is natural that some positions end up not matching their written description by the time you get to them.  Sometimes roles change as you are working them, and you may find your position description change quite a bit.  In the same vein, being a large company, Ford management moves around.  Sometimes you find that managers change or leave, as you get to your position, but that is more rare."}, {"review_title": "Low-quality engineers and treats people like children", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Dec 2014", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Dearborn, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Ford offers employees the ability to rotate into other parts of the business (and even requires this for college graduates).

Nobody wants to take charge to make a product truly excellent, people just want to coast by without doing any hard work.  A week stuck in meetings is a successful week to a lot of these people, even if no quantifiable work gets done after all the meetings.\r\n\r\nFord treats employees like children.  Employees have to go to mandatory hour-long \"trainings\" that basically tell you not to post confidential material on social networks and not to accept bribes from customers.  IT sends out emails like \"Cyber Steve learns about safe Web browsing\" with a picture of a little cartoon IT guy telling you to use a secure password.  It's insulting to be a professional engineer and having people treat you like a child.\r\n\r\nAnother big problem is Ford promotes peopled based on how long you've been with the company instead of the quality of your work.  This leads to, for example, an IT employee being promoted to supervisor of a production software team just because he's been at Ford the longest.  These are just two different worlds and they don't mesh well together, which is why some of these production products are a disaster.  People should be promoted based on the quality of their work, not for how many years they can sit behind the same desk.\r\n\r\nI have yet to meet someone at Ford who understands the difference between good software and bad software.  People seem to think that if \"it works\" then it's good software and the project is good to ship.  No!  That is absolutely wrong!

In my interviews, I was explicitly told that the pace of things at the new company would be very different (read fast) from Ford.\r\n\r\nPerformance reviews are a joke. You copy your generic goals from the start-of-year to the comments section. Supervisors do not even meet to discuss your career or to give any feedback on what you can do better.\r\n\r\nRed tape. Every single technical decision goes to layers of supervisors and managers and it never goes to technical experts. I noticed that even the most hard working people spent most of their time getting approvals from managers instead of working with technical experts to make great products.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, middle management does not value people for their technical skills. you can come with a bachelors/masters/phd or spend 10 years working at Ford, there are very few managers who will appreciate you for your skills. Most employees (at GSR level) are considered soldiers in an army; the managers only care about the quantity of soldiers, not who they are or what they bring to the table. Makes it very easy to stay under-radar if you don't like to work. Becomes very hard to do any work if you want to progress in career.\r\n\r\nI copied this from another review since it described supervisors very well. \"Since well over half the people do no work, supervisors keep adding staff saying they need more resources to get work done.\"\r\n\r\nGood luck using your personal business days.

For one, if you work at an auto plant outside Detroit, you basically aren't in the CFP:  mentoring circles, speakers, etc., are unavailable to you.  In my two years at the company, not a single person from the program talked to me individually--not to ask how I was doing or what direction I wanted to take my career.  \"CFP\" is mostly just a title--it doesn't mean you're on the fast track to anything, or in any way elite.

Promotional opportunities are limited thanks to several years of salary staff reductions and those that remain are holding firm to their jobs in the tough economy.

I planned to give 3 weeks notice as a courtesy to my team that I still highly respected so I could help them transition a new team member into my position during a very busy time in the project cycle.  Beware, the day you give notice they immediately excuse you from work and cut you off no matter what date you list in your resignation letter.  It seems they have a secret walk out policy.  Don't bother giving notice until you're ready to leave the same day.  I lost thousands and thousands of dollars in retirement money that would have vested in just a week had they honored a 2 weeks notice.  I was promised two weeks additional pay and unused vacation in my exit interview and a month later I haven't received anything and have been trying for over two weeks to reach someone and find out what happened.  They send you to an e-mail address that only responds every 4-5 days, and knows nothing. The person who gave me the promise never returned any of my calls until my wife called then emailed and referred me to the same phone number that knows nothing, well actually pretends to know nothing as I\u2019ve called them enough now to get the feeling their responses are scripted.  They give a pretense of helping me and answering my questions but we are still back at square one after over two weeks and I\u2019ve had to rephrase my question about ten times and they still don\u2019t get it.  Ford touts how good they are at communicating but anytime I try to call and get information, no one knows anything (or maybe pretends not to) and I'm just referred to automated e-mail addresses and voicemails.  Even as an employee we found out major company news from the mainstream news before they told their employees.  Horrible communication.  You can't find contact information anywhere to a live voice, probably on purpose.  I wanted to leave in a friendly manner but instead they seem to have made false promises and treated me like outsider scum so I've lost all respect I had for them which is really sad.  Thanks a lot Ford, it didn't have to be this way.

Yes I\u2019m bitter now, I\u2019ve wasted so much time trying to get only what was promised to me and I wasn\u2019t bitter when I walked in to give my notice or even when they walked me out the door although I was shocked. The last month of trying to work with completely clueless and incompetent Ford employees, policies and procedures has ruined it for me, zero customer service, and intentional avoidance.
