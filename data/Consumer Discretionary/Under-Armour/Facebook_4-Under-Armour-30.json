One was the Map My Fitness team (map my run, map my ride\u2026 all that) and then the DS team located in IT. This review is for the IT team - the Map My Fitness team seemed better and were doing very interesting work, but I can\u2019t speak for that part of the company other than that. \r\n\r\nThe team was very disorganized and leadership was so focused on trying to get buy-in from skeptical business partners (honestly don\u2019t blame them for their skepticism) that instead of trying to win them over with excellent work and collaboration, they took on an order taking stance. Whatever they want, just do it, and get it done fast. The quality of the work mattered less than making sure they were happy with the results, to the extent that there was pressure to make the numbers work, even if there was a lack of confidence that they were correct. \r\n\r\nEven though the team was in the IT org, they had virtually no technical support. This lead to risky data practices and no real plan for how they would support products beyond basic POC stages. Think lots of time doing manual runs whenever the biz wanted updated numbers, with the hope that whoever did the original run was a.) still around and b.) could remember what they did. Documentation was minimal, and code was not written with maintainability in mind. \r\n\r\nAll this could be handled if team leadership understood why this was a problem and would back the work needed to fix it. It needs to be a major focus area, not just something a couple people work on in their spare time. Bottom line, if leadership doesn\u2019t support a strong focus on fixing the basics, even if it's part of the work that biz partners don\u2019t see, it will never happen. If leadership doesn\u2019t understand it themselves, that support will never come. \r\n\r\nThey also have a very long history of relying on contractors/consultants to come in and do advanced analytics and DS work. They get the shiny one-off results that tell the story they wanted, but often the delivery doesn't include the actual code for the solution because that is proprietary/wasn't included in the contract. Then they expect their limited FTE resources to find a way to re-create and maintain that work without any way to replicate how the original solution was obtained. \r\n\r\nOn the business side itself, it\u2019s very old school and slow. They have to do so much critical planning years in advance because of how long it takes to get from idea stage to things in the stores. This applies to things like pricing - something that you would think a big company like this would prioritize being able to respond fast to given how quickly markets can change. You often hear the \"well, this is how it has always been\" reasoning. I hope potential employees are doing a lot of research on the health of the company before jumping in."}, {"review_title": "Total Rewards employee", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Sr. Compensation Analyst in Chattanooga, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Autonomy, forward thinking, great work/life balance", "cons": "remote workers can feel left out and do not get great training"}, {"review_title": "I enjoyed working here", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Retail Sales Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly coworkers and managers.

As an engineer, you can learn a significant amount from your teammates. It is encouraged to have open discussions with the team on pretty much anything: new or existing product ideas, technical projects, workflow optimizations, and so on. I personally never felt any disdain from my peers whenever I would converse with them about a seemingly radical idea because they were open-minded and critical thinkers. Because of this characteristic, it's allowed engineers from all levels to freely converse with each other without feeling like someone may pull rank on them. From a growth perspective, this is an incredible attribute in a team's culture.\r\n\r\nThere are several opportunities to work on meaningful and impactful initiatives that help peoples' lives. Because the surface area of health and fitness is so great, there are a plethora of ideas to explore. Some of the projects the teams worked on ended up resulting in patent acquisition, including the workout recording technology stack. The company lives through its initiatives by providing several fun opportunities to do events like taco runs, beta testing challenges, and yoga classes throughout the year. \r\n\r\nUnder Armour this year has taken a significant stance on providing speaker-series talks on anti-racism and social equality, which have been incredibly insightful. There is a healthy work/life balance with flexible working from home (prior to COVID-19).", "cons": "Connected Fitness is riddled with an obsession of micromanagement and subsequently, a lack of trust. As a manager for a few years, I learned how to properly protect my team from requests that were ambiguous, impossible, or not ready to accomplish in a given timeline. Often enough though, if I had responded negatively, my decision would be superseded by another non-technical manager talking to one of my direct reports directly (to which they would reply positively). It wouldn't be until later in a planning meeting that a direct report of mine would be assigned work that I specifically declined, which unfortunately resulted in stymying my direct reports' career paths. This caused some distrust amongst leaders from different teams, and subsequently, some attrition due to engineers not being able to work on projects largely related to their development plan. It was because of this lack of trust and my own personal stagnation of career growth that I moved back into an engineering role, in hopes to help foster and drive these technical initiatives.\r\n\r\nConnected Fitness operates based on the notion of completing largely product-focused goals at the expense of thoughtfully building a given teammate's career based on their development plan. This meant that most technical projects were met critically with non-technical stakeholders due to the lack of product-facing incentives. Even if technical projects included objectives like improving the user experience, increasing the fidelity and resilience of a session, or reducing crash rates by fixing a system, these were often overlooked for projects that would add a new feature or a new screen against a broken system. Candidly-speaking, this is due to a lack of maturity from the product team. \r\n\r\nFrom a company standpoint, unfortunately the pay is not as competitive as other tech companies in Austin. Due to the volatility of stocks, the bonus percentage payout is inconsistent. Compensation increases are often minimal, and promotion opportunities are difficult to navigate due to the aforementioned issues with product goals and the overall leanness of the engineering teams. In terms of career growth, it is difficult to advance beyond the first few levels unless an opportunity exists for backfilling an open position.
