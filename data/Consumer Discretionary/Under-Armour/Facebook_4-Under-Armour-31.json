Lastly, since the DM consistently has their store manager\u2019s back (which is fine), the store manager is also never held accountable - mostly sits in the office as though it were a desk job rather than retail, pawns off tasks on the rest of the management staff as they say they have more important things to do, and hasn\u2019t had a single developmental conversation with me to help me improve upon my leadership skills. \n\nThe HR department is very difficult to deal with and rarely allows the retail team to hold employees accountable for call outs or misconduct, without questioning the manager attempting to initiate the corrective action. This results in the team thinking it\u2019s okay to call out without coverage, or not show up at all. \n\nFinally, the staff I have worked with both previously and presently are often very young (typically 18-20) meaning there is constantly drama and rumors which makes the environment very toxic and difficult to work in.

However I did not receive anything, instead I was left to buy more $100 worth of cloths. During my first day of work, where other managers would go through a training process, my manager passed me along to one of the employees and I was explained the very basic UA terms like the Cold and Heat Gear.  Also instead of explaining how to deal with costumers, they gossiped and talked bad about previous costumers. I can even recall a moment where there was an eager costumer waiting outside the door prior to opening and instead of politely explaining to that costumer that they were not open, the manager said surprisingly \"just don't look at them and they will go away\". To make things even worse, throughout my employment the manager didn't even bother telling me how to view my schedule or to even clarify the length of my employment as well as the basic job expectations. \r\nI worked there for about 3 weeks until one day I showed up and was greeted by one of the managers with a \"you dont work here anymore.. go home\".  I asked how to request more time and he handed me a packet with a link to the employee website. However after requesting more time, I was left for a month without a response. After a month of silence I was denied and left without an explanation.  I applied again a few days later and instead of explaining that they were not interested, they just decided to delete my account.
