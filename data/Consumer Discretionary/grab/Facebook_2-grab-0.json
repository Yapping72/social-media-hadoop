Example: The manager is not tech savvy, so he/she will hire a tech background person to fill that void for a role that requires example stronger business domain knowledge.) Than they will throw the entire responsibility on you. (LOL)\r\n2. No repercussions or accountability of any sorts for timeline slips, operational issues in general. (Weeeeee!) \r\n3. Free to do anything you want during office hours without anyone to check on you! (able to go and run errands as and when needed, and to attend to family needs. Weeee!) \r\n4. Don't need to be technically savvy or business savvy. Just need to know how to talk, and you can lead one stream and get an inflated title of Head. Probably about 5 - 6 yrs of relevant experience and you can be a head there! (Shiooook!!)\r\n5. Tech team based in India, start work during SG lunch hours, goes for lunch when you get back and only start working for 2 hours a day ( 4 - 6pm SGT) with you. Therefore they only can look at 1 issue a day! (Shiok man, lesser for us do and just tell the boss that tech cannot deliver)\r\n6. Tech team are like gold, need to keep them happy so they wont run away. So the bosses don't come down hard on them even if they just do minimal or don't do the work. \r\n7. Super high increment annually ( 10%ish) and Promotion every 2 years! (Where to find this man!) \r\n8. Travel is so frequent, if you like to brag on your social media with biz travel.. This is the place for you! \r\n9. You can focus on your side hustles, and jobs :):)\r\n10. if you are lazy to learn new things, just come in here and do what they want you to. And you can probably live a stress free life and command a higher pay!\r\n\r\nTo conclude: If you are skilled, make sure you join at senior levels, you will get full flexibility, super duper nice increment and promotion and can do whatever you want there with minimal micromanagement due to the fact that dependency is on you to help them deliver.

After working here it\u2019s clear what they show it to the people of Singapore and SEA and what they think and the way they work internally is poles apart. It\u2019s a Rabbit hole. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a company which is stuck in \u2018creative rut\u2019. There is no creative freedom because designs are controlled by your design leaders and product managers who have a very strong say in everything. Yes, everything. One of the 4H is Hunger and it\u2019s a hunger for money. \r\n\r\nWork life balance is a mess here. You can see lots of reviews about this. My day starts at 9-9:30 am and ends at 8-9 pm. My average has been 12-15 hrs in past 3 years and I started to feel what am I doing and it\u2019s not good for life and health. HR tends to ingnore these issues. Let\u2019s say there is no HR here. People set too many meetings. They don\u2019t even honour lunch time. It feels like a slave here. When you talk to your manager they say you need to manage your time and they blame you for their cultural mess. Which reults into stress and pressure because you need to prove yourself everyday here. Designers who are good with leaders/PM\u2019s run the show which shows how the bad quality of design work is. Guess what all design leaders can\u2019t see how is good and who is not.\r\n\r\nPeople are very political and you can\u2019t trust them. Most of the time they talk about you on your back. Promotions are not based on how you perform but how good you are at your PR skills. How good are you with your bosses also you need to be a chatterbox. I know a person who\u2019s feedback wasn\u2019t good but was promoted. If you are a chatterbox you win it\u2019s ok if your design skills aren\u2019t great or your don\u2019t deliver the quality. Design heads are fine with this because that's how they are also. All design leaders wants is just the visibility nothing else. None of the leaders has not demonstrated to me that Grab value design. New HOD doesn't deserve to be at the position. Working with her is very very hard. This person sounds emotion less, no empathy for team members and sounds very rude most of the time. Before these new HOD\u2019s design team used to be much better. Current design leaders are a not leaders. Nothing seems to be moving here. It\u2019s mess and no one knows what\u2019s going on and how to fix. Dirty politics and favouritism played by design managers and HOD\u2019s. All design and product leaders have created a culture which is not positive. Design leaders and managers are busy in builidng their own profile and enjoying their life and money. Its the designers who are struggling a lot and thats why every month designers are leaving. Company don\u2019t want to understand why and how can they fix it. They are not interested in fixing but showing that they bring impact. But where is impact? Why its not visible to the design team? Design leaders/managers/product and the leadership is a Gang of Rude Arrogant Blabber mouth. Everyone works here just to impress one person and that's how chain of command works.

Grab acquired Uber's SE Asia operations because of Softbank's support, and they were the principal investor in both the companies. Uber's technology platform is superior, and its operations management methodology is better than Grab by many orders of magnitude. Browse to the public Github repos of Uber and Grab to get a better idea. \r\nThe work-environment in Grab remains very politically charged. There are hordes of engineers who are incompetent but get promoted to G5 or G6 solely based on \"good relations\" with their reporting managers.\r\nDuring my stint at Grab, I have across multiple instances in which a team of engineers would attempt to reinvent the wheel. A group built a documentation microsite using Hugo instead of using an existing system like Confluence (Wiki). There was yet another group that developed a mock-server, instead of using WireMock or MounteBank. Furthermore, the Engineering Lead was blissfully unaware of these open-source tools. Finally, this custom mock-server was buggy, painful to use, and did not have a single useful feature. \r\nThe application codebase is bloated and is full of unsound (if not outrightly bad) engineering practices. The situation is so dire that Android Studio is unable to load the application codebase. The official recommendation on one of the documentation microsites is to use an alternate code editor (vi or vscode). Furthermore, you won't be able to build the codebase on your local machine, and the only way you can test your code is to use CI or to use remote infrastructure using Mainframer. \r\nThe processes that are in place make engineering teams feel worthless and actively infantilize engineers and individual contributors. A manager has to approve almost each and everything, even something as trivial as internally publishing a code-labs (guided tutorial) or a video presentation on a component that you have designed and developed."}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "27 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Delivery Driver in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible work hours and decent pay", "cons": "compensation system for orders can be flawed sometimes"}, {"review_title": "grab job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Business Development Associate in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "easy job, and able work out of the office sometimes", "cons": "interaction with customers and management can get frustrating sometimes"}, {"review_title": "Overall", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good company with good benefit", "cons": "Not organised and too demanding leadership"}, {"review_title": "Good overall", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Data Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance.

When money was not a problem and tech-companies were all hyped out, life was, of course, good and morale was high.\r\n- With recent developments in the tech world where IPOs are shelved and heavily-funded tech-companies on the verge of going bankrupt, you would expect Grab to be under a lot of pressure. Grab is the only company now that is going to help save the face of one of its biggest backers. You should know who and what I'm referring to.\r\n- Expect pressure to trickle down from the top, and when you put human self-interests into the equation, expect toxicity to arise as well. The toxicity I am referring to will come in different forms. People getting disengaged, morale being extremely low, and generally people who are just looking out for themselves.\r\n- The inadequacies of management are beginning to show during this troubled times when the race to profitability is the absolute priority now. When things are going good, managing the company and a team will definitely be easy, but everyone is being put to the test now and what a lot of middle-management and below staff have witnessed is nothing short of disappointing.\r\n- A lot of the senior managers who joined the company were pulled-in by their previous colleagues, so there is definitely some form of corporate-nepotism which was OK at the start, but people are now realizing they are really not fit for the job. Unfortunately, some of them hold lead positions, and you'll often hear that Human Resources is mediocre which any current and former staff can attest to.\r\n- Morale is extremely low in the company. Management is extremely good at painting a pretty picture and are good with words, but at the end of the day it counts for nothing.\r\n- The company is running on staff with an average tenure of around 1.5 to 1.7 years, so this says a lot. There will always be people who are willing to take a pay-increment and enter the company to slog for a year or two, and then use the company brand to go to another bigger, more established, and more importantly profitable tech firm. Everything looks nice on the outside, but inside, it's a mess.\r\n- Do not expect to be promoted unless you are willing to sacrifice everything else in your life for the company. Career progress is horrid here because of cost-cutting and there will always be people applying to join the company. Management does not map out your career path clearly for you here.\r\n- Staff benefits are considered mediocre compared to industry standards because, again, becoming profitable is the focus. But you can't expect much when Human Resources are a joke in the company.

So while switching you are able to negotiate for higher offers.", "cons": "Post interview process:\r\n\r\nGrab was lethargic in handling the post interview process too. Once they confirmed the offer, I told them about another offer and asked to speed up next steps so that I could let the other company know or make an informed decision. But they were not even replying properly and behaved as if they are doing a favor by giving the offer. This is because of the superiority feeling that everyone in Grab has. However it is sheer arrogance.\r\n\r\nAfter joining:\r\n\r\nI interviewed for one role but just because they had an opening in another team they put in that team and the people in other teams themselves ridiculed this team. This gave me the realization that I had made a huge mistake joining Grab and not choosing the other offer. This showed the unprofessionalism of the people as well. This did not happen for me alone. This happened for many people actually. The environment itself looks pathetic, not just for one team but almost everyone I have spoken with. It's the most sad environment I have ever worked in. I was unhappy the entire time and depressed too because of joining Grab and I thought it was my mistake initially. But after seeing others, I realized that the founders, leadership, senior management have created this miserable environment and not bothered about it too.\r\n\r\nIrony is that culture value deck asks people to be humble. However, a bunch of people I interacted with, were the most arrogant people I have ever met in life. Nobody knows what is humility or humbleness. Everyone is just trying so hard to prove others that they are the best. Well, what is the point in doing that? Instead they should focus on improving the app.\r\n\r\nReorg:\r\n\r\nAlmost every month there was a re-org. Well one of the culture values is disrupt or be disrupted. I think the some teams like SRE team took it literally for the team and decided to disrupt everyone every month or otherwise they \"assumed\" management will disrupt them. Literally there was re-org every few months and their leadership changed every few months. So there was no stability or reliability for the team itself. Ironic that this happened for SRE who are supposed to bring reliability for the services. This affected my service team too badly for sure.\r\n\r\nWork and Culture:\r\n\r\nDevops and Infra is the worst team here definitely. Internal politics is too much. They created SRE team for services, who are again just bunch of arrogant people, who are not really bothered about improving Grab. They just want to get promoted just because they think they deserve it, even if they have not done anything useful. That team is just a proxy to other devops and service teams. During issues, they do not do anything themselves. They plead others to fix and hope that it gets fixed. But still they seek credit for that by mentioning that in their performance reviews. \r\n\r\nPeople there are only interested in getting promoted. While wanting to get promoted is not bad thing, they want to get promoted badly that they will do only things that get them promotion or better rating and never implement anything. I have known people who got promoted just by talking alone endlessly or just writing proposal document and never implemented anything. Having read blog posts from other companies, the same thing was done by interns in other companies successfully and in Grab it was just a proposal document forever and still just for writing that and not implementing it, they get a huge rating. People speak like they moved mountains when in fact they just changed some metadata in a web console.\r\n\r\nI have heard people complaining so much about others getting promoted. That is the culture now. Everyone wants to beat others and become highest Grab levels in career ladder but never once I heard anyone really talking about fixing issues for the customers or drivers.\r\n\r\nPromotions:\r\n\r\nAnybody can get promoted just by speaking endlessly without creating value for end-users. Grab has managed to create a culture where everyone wants to be promoted alone whether they make end-users happy or not. Are Grab drivers really happy? No I don't think so. If you say you are from Grab, they complain so much but they still keep you in car because of their professionalism. But the people inside Grab do not have that much professionalism.\r\n\r\nI have known people who got promoted just by portraying themselves as experts from other top companies or just by doing worse internal products that do not really add any value to the service teams. Just for their performance review they do it. \r\n\r\nPeople who have just worked in industry for 2 or 3 years can become manager if they just express that interest and they are not evaluated whether they are managerially suitable or not. So people who report to them are screwed.  \r\nI have known really good people leave the company because of the stupid politics.\r\n\r\nWanting to get promoted is not a bad thing. But if you copy Google and Amazon culture blindly, you get a culture where Gmail interface is changed just because someone wanted to get promoted and they just put billion users to relearn whatever they spent learning in Gmail interface.  There are so many improvements that can be made in Grab Food but it is not done because of promotion-centric mindset. That's why other apps in market are better to use as a customer.
