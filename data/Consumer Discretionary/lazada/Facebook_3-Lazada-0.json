Whatever the highest ranking person made up on the spot after five minutes becomes the strategy. People under them will not try to advise them based on any actual numbers or help provide insights.

Alibaba said they need to integrate Redmart after a short meeting, so they immediately did it without taking any time to think about customer impact, how to do it smoothly or properly. Execution without insight. Within 3 months Redmart was dead.\r\n\r\nNo regard for what's right for the business. Follow the KPI your boss told you at all costs, even if it destroys business and customer experience. It doesn't matter what kind of business you have, following a KPI blindly without judgement is always bad for business in the long run. People will not do things that are easy, quick and good for the business just because their KPI didn't say it.\r\n\r\nThe worst HR function I've ever seen in my life.
