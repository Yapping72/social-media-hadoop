First off, their main metric for productivity on my team was \"butts in seats\". So no matter how much work you got done, you were expected to be in your seat from 9 am sharp, until 6:30pm, with an hour lunch that better not go a minute outside of 12-1. My manager once told me this was because \"if my boss walks through and sees that nobody is here, they'll think no work is getting done.\" Other teams at THD measure productivity by Lines of Code, widely regarded as the stupidest possible productivity metric for software development. As expected, this results in really bad, intentionally drawn-out code. Management also uses gaslighting and fear to keep employees in check. At the time I got hired by THD, they were rebranding their corporate imagine and saying they were now a \"silicon valley tech company\". This was because they had garnered a reputation around Atlanta for being a developer sweat shop and treating their corporate employees terribly. The rebranding was a lie. They were still the same company. A couple months into my tenure at THD, they laid off ALL of their contractors (hundreds, most of whom were recently hired and many of whom were on visas and had to leave the country because of the sudden layoffs), because they didn't meet their earnings goals, EVEN THOUGH they plainly said this was due to inclement weather that year, and they had made more money that year than they ever had previously. They did it with a clear message of \"work hard or you might be next\". The team that I was on was half local and half in another city. The team in the other city seemed to think that if they didn't \"beat us\" then they might get cut (a mentality that was, no doubt, handed down by the awful, toxic management at THD, that you will find all throughout the company at the corporate level). This created an environment of ANTI-collaboration. Teammates would actually withhold information privately, and then share it demeaning-ly in meetings, holding up development for the sake of looking like the better employee. We even had meetings that exploded into name-calling between the two teams. Everyone I know who still works for this company is miserable and trying to get out. I got out as fast as I could. I've worked at a handful of places. Some decent, some great. But THD is the only place I've worked that I would call TOXIC, and I still can't believe how terrible and childish the culture was. I would not recommend working here to my worst enemy."}, {"review_title": "Great for Military", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Lumber Sales Associate in Cedar City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Was able to leave on a Military leave of absence with no issues and get supplemental pay while being gone.

They promote a concept of \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201cbleeding orange\u201d and \u201cliving the 8 core values\u201d which can help with a sense of belonging, for those who care (others prefer to mind their own business \u2014 totally fine). Those other reviews that bash on this as a \u201ccultist\u201d thing over the company cheer are over-reacting. It\u2019s there but participation is 100% voluntary; I\u2019ve never done one myself (you can say \u201dNo\u201d people\u2026) As far as benefits go, Home Depot provides a solid spectrum (tuition reimbursement, Kaiser for health insurance, etc). I myself didn\u2019t learn it\u2019s true value until they were lost (I moved on). On a related note, one of my favorite things Home Depot does is their Homer Fund \u2014 a program designed to help associates in need due to extenuating circumstances (death, natural disaster, etc.). It\u2019s funded by associates, then matched by the company. Overall it\u2019s a good variety. Career-wise, let me preface this by saying that politics are Everywhere \u2014 no matter what job or industry, there will always be the favorites/unfavorites game and you will always be faced with unfair disadvantages. That said, the opportunity Home Depot proves is incredible if you can navigate yourself to those open doors. So go in and kick butt and you will be training on heavy equipment and other functions in 3-6 months and possibly promoted with another 12 months. I\u2019ve seen people come in and get supervisor role in 1.5 years. There are people who have had an opportunity to join the support roles (Auditing, Asset Protection, Transportation, etc). Some have even gone into Corporate or Engineering fields. The opportunity is definitely there, and while the playing field is never fully fair to everyone, hard work does go a long way. Anyways, I\u2019ve said a lot, and while this company isn\u2019t perfect, Home Depot strikes a great balance. You can either complain about its negatives or chose to be more positive or open minded about the opportunity. *Also, the extra day(s) off you get with the 4/10 and 3/12 shifts is INCREDIBLE.

Either that or if you are in or fresh out of high school this job is decent for the time being until you find something better, and if you are in that position, DO IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN.", "cons": "Training is tons of short \"interactive\" videos that go on and on. There is so much content you most likely aren't going be able to finish it all (let alone remember half of it) until a few months later like most people do. Instead you'll get sent to the sales floor and learn from there through your peers (who they themselves don't always know every bit and procedure of their job since they were in the same boat as you when they started and some still learning different things months later). Outside of the Service Desk most departments work like this as well. Not only that you end up learning things in these videos that don't even pertain to your department or job description, which is why I say you will probably end up forgetting half of the info from these videos because of how painfully non-engaging, long and sometimes irrelevant to what you would actually be doing in store (depending on your department of course). This make the job incredibly frustrating because you will be semi-regularly critiqued by management and look like a moron in-front of customers to no fault of your own. Otherwise it's tolerable for a bit until you find something better, given the area the customers you get are a mixed bag. Some very fine folk and others, straight up degenerate scum bags (blatantly obvious drug addicts, thieves etc). It's not uncommon where customers come in to either steal or return merchandise they took from the store for one of Home Depots \"Store Credit\" cards so that they could probably buy whatever using the credit with basically free money (probably to flip it later or just for keeps). And of course like any retail store there will be \"karen\" types who come in complaining about their return not going through even though they don't have a receipt of any kind (this is the most manageable but time consuming part of the job), they will argue and argue not to get store credit. Although sometimes its not totally their fault since at the checkout, cashiers may scan something twice or miss-input something into the register. Resulting in us being forced to take their word for it and pushing a return through anyway despite them having two of one item on a receipt and they only have one of that item, and another of a similar item (this usually happens after having to get a manager or supervisor so you can C.Y.A.). All of this would be manageable if the people who worked here were payed more. As of writing this I started at $14.50, and only got a raise when minimum wage was bumped, now I am at $15.50 roughly. Your hours are messed with constantly and the times you work are far from consistent, rather erratic in fact. Either HR or corporate do not know how to manage hours correctly or are being intentionally stingy when it comes to pay (which especially sucks since were are in a real recession, our wages are the same but everything drains your wallet). It is most likely why turnover rate is so high for the store compared to other Home Depots (let alone in general) and is constantly understaffed. If I had a couple of dollars for every time a customer asked for assistance in a aisle or department when no one was there, id make enough to rival my current wages. TL;DR if you have better options.
