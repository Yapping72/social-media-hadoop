It is grueling on your body and there is never enough help for loading in evenings. Feels like they load the morning crew on scheduling and when I start my shift, regular carts, 4 /6 wheelers / lumber carts are EVERYWHERE. There has to be a balance because this creates high turnover rates. It is very hard to run from garden getting wheat and pine straw and then run to the other side of the store to help get plywood and gyp board loaded and then run to the other side again to get 20 bags of mulch and run again to the pro side to get 10 bags of 80 lbs concrete. Minimal support and again high turn over rate is understandable in this position. Closing stock is 3 times more difficult than opening. Pass some of those duties on to the person opening. At my store, you have carts everywhere and the first part of my shift, I\u2019m just trying to maintain. I work fast and very fit but even I have difficulties keeping up. Closing lot has to do all the trash in the front (including dumping), make sure the pine and wheat straw is presentable for customers, leaf blow the entire front and side of the store and make sure all carts are ready for customers in the morning. Add on to this loads and getting pine and wheat straw. I may move in the store to try to avoid lot duties. All of that for 13.50 an hour.

Otherwise, there's absolutely nothing fulfilling about the job. For starters, on the nightshift, you work 4 10 hour shifts, so for those four days the job takes over your life. Between working the shift, and getting rest, you have no time for your family until the end of the week, so your personal life is compressed into just 3 days of the week, Friday through Sunday. The job and the stress that comes with it, can be harmful to your health, both physically and mentally. My health suffered a great deal until I left. The company does offer health insurance, but the premiums for a policy that's useful, are so high, that it's not affordable. As a MET associate, you are second class. The stores don't respect you. For the most part, the stores treat you as if you dropped out of elementary school. The management, both at the store and corporate level can be very arrogant  I had done this type of work, with third party merchandising companies, but Home Depot had just simply taken all the enjoyment out of the job.

When I worked there we were paid $12 an hour, which wasn't fair compensation for how hard the department worked.\n-I worked a customer service role behind a desk, but there was way more physical labor than expected. If you have physical problems of any kind, I wouldn't recommend this company. \n-Outdated systems that constantly stopped working. Only way to fix it most of the time was to call IT and be on the phone waiting and being transferred for 2 hours sometimes.\n-Especially depending on what role you have or certifications you earn, there are many potential hazards. There's sawdust in the air, machinery being used, extremely heavy products in the store, and a lot going on since it's a working warehouse. \n-The customers at my store were entitled and abusive to workers. I have worked other customer service jobs and it wasn't as bad as my time here. I was screamed at every single day and dealt with so many difficult customers. Management would help us out, but would give in to appease unruly customers. Instead of holding their ground and backing us up, customers would get their way and this created a vicious cycle. These people knew they could act horribly and get their way, which was extremely hard for us in customer service. \n-There was never enough staff in other departments. People in my department had to do tasks and help customers in departments we weren't familiar with. We had to constantly step away from the Special Services desk when we were already swamped.\n-The Special Services department has way too much on their plate. Most other retail stores have several departments making up all the responsibilities we had! There was always an extremely long line because we were in charge of curbside orders, returns, in-store sales transactions, online orders, pro customer orders (due to the pro desk's limited hours), customer service and assistance, will call orders, answering and transferring all incoming store calls, delivery issues, order picking, loading large items for customers, and more.\nOn top of that, we had to support other departments. People don't last long at the Special Services desk because we are in charge of too many tasks and are expected to take on others. The Service Desk should be broken up into several departments to alleviate the stress on employees and for the customer experience. If you're interested in working for Home Depot, work in any other department besides Special Services.
