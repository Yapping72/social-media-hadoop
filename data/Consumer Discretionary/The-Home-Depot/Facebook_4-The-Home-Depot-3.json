We are very good at communication, and I have face to face meetings with my co-workers all day long, without ever leaving my home, or having to put shoes on.

Then there are stock awards where they give you huge chunks of stock each year, along with modest bonuses.\n\nThere is a massive emphasis on career development, so when your manager asks you what you picture yourself doing in 5 years, the next sentence is \"Let's build a plan with action items to achieve that goal\". MANY people in the top layers of the company started sweeping the floors...

I realized that most upper management gets fired or leaves, you get to stay, because you are too valuable. Kitchen Designers are the cream of the crop for the company. They make top dollar and make more money for the company than any other department. So, if you don't screw up kitchens and lose money for them, you are never going to lose your job. It's hard to find someone to replace you. However, it's highly stressful. You have sales goals every month, which aren't hard to make. (Because they understaff) You do get cranky in the summertime because the store gets hot, customers are hot, and there isn't enough time to finish anything, so you are always behind the eight ball. Overtime is frowned upon. If you're habitually late, you will get fired. I have seen that happen to many associates. And it's a warehouse, you'll get dirty. Wearing an apron all day gets very old.
