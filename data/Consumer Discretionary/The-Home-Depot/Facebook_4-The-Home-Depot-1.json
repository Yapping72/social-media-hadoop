High level of supervision and monitoring, even during breaks and lunch. Extremely low pay for the amount of work required.  Pathetically low bonus and minimal pay increase while company and CEO make millions.  \r\n\r\nManagement uses threat of firing as a way to motivate workers during group meetings. Always expect to be busy and doing something, except for their chosen favourites who would often disappear.\r\n\r\n No staff discount and air conditioning during the hot Summer months.

I was not a THD employee -- I was an employee of one of THD's vendor companies that supplies and maintains plants in THD's garden centers -- but I'm reviewing THD here (specifically the Reading branch) because THD management at this location frequently made the job a miserable experience. Their lack of support for vendors borders on hostility. They couldn't/wouldn't meet our basic needs, like consistent access to garden hoses with water in them, within reach of all of the plants. The position is similar to stocking groceries, but the shelves are always full. \"Tell your boss not to order so many plants.\" (Sir, that's not my-) \"DON'T TALK BACK\" Plants dying right and left, some of mold and some of drought. Literally thousands more arrive every week, like there is zero communication between the store and the vendor sending the trucks over with more. Safety issues: A vendor's employee at a different THD location was seriously injured while trying to roll a new-plant-filled cart over a garden hose (the heavy cart tipped and fell on her). At this branch there's always at least one hose in your way, impossible to avoid them. These hoses are impulsively arranged and re-arranged by the hypersensitive, incompetent elderly THD employee tasked with designing and maintaining the constantly-malfunctioning system of watering equipment; hoses he's attached with automotive clamps, held down with zipties (!) are constantly tripping up vendors' carts as well as customers' shopping carts. The garden center supervisor on site rolls her eyes and says she doesn't care what he does. My own employer says, \"Go ahead and disconnect them while you're rolling carts in, and re-connect them when you're finished\". Then the Reading store manager, with a stunning lack of situational awareness says, \"Under NO circumstances do you EVER touch a hose in my store- DO YOU HEAR ME? DON'T TALK BACK.\" None of this misery is necessary to the position. It's all about these specific people at this specific store.
