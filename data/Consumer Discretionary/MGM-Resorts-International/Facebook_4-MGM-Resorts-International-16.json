Managers sneak into rooms before assigned and steal your tips from each room as well as housemen. They can select exactly who gets what assignments and they usually do not favor anyone who is not hispanic. Its very easy to tell how management feels about their staff especially top supervisors. You are on call for all shifts all the time. You only have a 15 min grace period to respond back to them if you miss schedulings call. They will conduct inspections on whoever they want at any point and make up reasons to fail you if they want to. They all talk and they know exactly what they\u2019re doing. These rooms are old and dusty and heavy dust in the vents causes cleaned rooms to accumulate dust very quickly. The sheets are 80% stained by clean. Most maids do not toss them they just recycle them back into population which is terrible to have to load tour cart with stained linen for nothing. Most use white out to touch up the stains. It\u2019s a ruthless job of having to accept abuse from people who probably couldnt even meet the expectations themselves of 10-15 checkouts per day. They do not embrace diversity and discrimination based on your ethnicity heavy.

Attendance was very black and white, not understanding at all. This company cares about numbers at the end of the day. \n\nYou work here, you're disposable, you're nothing if you're not making them money, they will work you as much as they can. Management are always under the chains of corporate and looking good for their own managers and directors. Rarely any one, even HR is understanding. You do not get much as far as rewards, just do the minimum of your job and go home. Hospitality jobs usually are not very lucrative, I would not suggest working here as a young adult unless you're just here to get a paycheck, tips, commissions, etc. and go. Don't expect this company to be loyal to you as much as you are to them, unless you're union, you really have no protection, back-up, or say. They always say they care about their employees but nothing dramatic in the years I have been here changed as far employee satisfaction."}, {"review_title": "So much bureaucracy and incompetence", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "17 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Production Supervisor in Las Vegas, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best Casinos and Resorts on the strip.\nGreat way to learn the business.", "cons": "They want to be a high-tech modern work environment but most management is toxic.\nThey promote the most difficult and problematic people, they confuse arrogance with talent.\nSalaries are not competitive.\nOnce you're in the company moving up is practically impossible."}, {"review_title": "Incompetent", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits\nFree uniform \nFree lunch", "cons": "Not enough pay \nTime off request sucks"}, {"review_title": "Not really what you would expect", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Marketing Coordinator", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free lunches\nFree parking\nStability \nNice coworkers", "cons": "Job description is not accurate going into it\nDealing with disrespectful casino guests \nSpend hours unpacking boxes in dress clothes"}, {"review_title": "It\u2019s Corporate", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Manager in Las Vegas, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Leading name in hospitality and entertainment \n-Numerous resources for success\n-Good benefits", "cons": "-Constant restructuring leads to a stressful work environment \n-Follow-through with upper management is lacking\n-Compensation is below average"}], [{"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good people also good environment", "cons": "Not really anything so far"}, {"review_title": "decent company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Guest Services Representative in Las Vegas, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "paid lunch breaks, 8 hour shifts, easy to learn and great atmosphere", "cons": "when you start in on call/part time you have to roll with the shifts they have, schedule only comes out a week in advance"}, {"review_title": "Great if you like the hospitality industry& looking to market", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Concierge in Las Vegas, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, employee perks, culture", "cons": "Lack of pay increase but will add to your workload"}, {"review_title": "Union Ran", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Banquet Server", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great atmosphere and fun and enjoyable", "cons": "Have to gain seniority to work part time hours no benefits  for part time or on call employees"}, {"review_title": "Company Transitioned to a TPA", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Claims Coordinator in Las Vegas, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Looks nice on your resume, to say you came from MGM Resorts Int.", "cons": "Under Paid, and lousy management."}, {"review_title": "Good workplace", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Business Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Easy to work with and fast-paced environment.", "cons": "Overall good, nothing specific to mention"}, {"review_title": "Large", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Golf Sales Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Organized.

Those who stay with the company the longest are the lowest paid and the least respected. I am getting a 45% raise at my new company and I will be doing the same job. \r\n- Incredibly behind the times when it comes to digital innovation and it hurts consumer positioning. The head of that vertical is essentially a revolving door. By the time someone gets settled/forms a strategy, they end up leaving after realizing how truly behind market standards MGM is. It takes on average 1.5 years for each turnover. (I witnessed 3) They don't even have customer data insights centralized across systems, but they have been talking about doing it since 2016. \r\n- Since the big layoffs of MGM 2020 that took place in 2019, the diversity of upper management ranks has worsened, been acknowledged but not yet corrected. Overconsilidation due to re-org is one thing (and something they appear to be trying to course-correct) but forgoing previously stated diversity goals in lieu of the bottom line was a pretty transparently clear and bold action.\r\n- Lack of women/diverse leadership fosters a culture of a \"boys club\" that has plagued the industry forever. The corporate culture is so tilted, I have been on calls where multiple women (senior level!) could not get a single word in w/o being interrupted by men. On a corporate level, I think this got worse during the pandemic with remote work. \r\n- The Chief of HR and social impact is largely out of touch. Came from a wall st bank and has seemingly no understanding of the industry. I came to view her team as empty suits that delegate the real HR work to legacy industry folks who will never be granted higher roles and have proven themselves as unwilling to implement any innovative practices in regards to career pipeline and overall talent management.
