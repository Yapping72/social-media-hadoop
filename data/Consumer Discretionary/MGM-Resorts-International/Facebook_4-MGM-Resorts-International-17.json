If it wasn't for this department, I may have to agree 80%.", "cons": "It is not \"what\" they do that makes this department just a horrible work environment (Since \"what\" they do is pretty straight forward. The job title of Surveillance Operator says it all).\r\n\r\nWhat makes this place not horrible but ATROCIOUS are the people that work in the department. They are nothing but bullies. First off, this department's protocol of training for a new hire is... sit here and learn everything on your own. This comes from a... highly intellectual, slash that, moronic group of people (think University of Phoenix graduate... no offense to any UoP graduates, but having to have graduated Northwestern... I find UoP to be a joke...) with little or no education. Some started out in the casino business as security, etc. etc. and pretty much jobs that required more brawn than brain. \r\n\r\nWhat makes the majority of the employees in this department a bully is that they are such megalomaniacs. I believe most of this delusional attitude stems from the fact that majority of them (especially the supervisors) have been in the same hole of an office for over a decade. \r\nThey are so stuck in their own dimension (which is not much really) that they don't even care about basic humanity towards others, (especially their co-workers). I have seen a lady (she would be classified as senior citizen by many) be verbally abused by the supervisors and other co-workers right in front of me. And just as any old grandma would do, she just sat there and took it.  Un-be-lievable. \r\n\r\nIf you are thinking about taking this job -- which is advertised by MGM all the time  (weird isn't it?) -- don't do it during the holiday season. You see, all the employees in this department, which is not many, want to take their vacay... some are too broke to even do that... but most will take it due to PTO hours accrued. If you get the job, you're only getting hired to be there while these people use their PTO hours. After that \"bye bye\" says the boss man.\r\n\r\nIf you don't find what I wrote here convincing enough and still want this job, do it at your own risk. And here's a little guide to surviving this nefarious workplace.\r\n\r\nWhat do idiots fear the most? People that are smarter than them (even by a nanogram...)\r\n\r\n1. Dumb yourself down (I didn't disclose my \"Northwestern\" graduate part to this department. After I saw the sad bunch of people with their deer caught in headlight look... I really felt that this was not the place who'd care where I graduated)\r\n\r\n2. Ignore most of the employees (because that's what they will do to you)\r\n\r\n3. Dumb yourself down further more. (These are people who are afraid to leave for a better paying job since they know that they won't get hired by others... you don't want to sound smarter than them)\r\n\r\n4. If they bully you, even a tad... report to HR. Many supervisors and employees there have been reported to HR. Situation got bad in there with co-workers beating each other up... physically and verbally.\r\n\r\n5. If you don't survive, come work for my company. We treat humans humane :)\r\n\r\nAs for MGM, rumor has it that it is a GREAT company to work for. I would believe this 80%, if it wasn't for the Gaming Surveillance Department.\r\n\r\nIf you are like me and gets po-ed easily for seeing someone mistreat others, I will leave you with this great quote :)\r\n\r\n\"You have enemies? Good! That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.\"\r\n-- Winston Churchill, U.K. prime minister\r\n\r\nGood luck!
