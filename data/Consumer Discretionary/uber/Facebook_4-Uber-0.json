So, that independent contractor role they brag about is not true as I am penalized for not taking low paying orders not even worth my gas mileage. The customer can say anything they want about you and you have no way to fight it or defend yourself. This means if a customer rated you poorly, you just have to accept it.

Great flexible hours", "cons": "Let's start at the basics the GPS map is far from updated and still shows places that have been out of business for several years. As a driver you get NO protection other then a safety button to call authorities. Policy's are geared to protect the rider and not the driver. So if a concern arises that the rider states something Uber is quick to focus on that and state that such reviews go against terms and conditions of employment. Yet we as drivers do not get to prove anything. I have had issues where it was supposedly stated I said something yet I asked them to review my dash cam footage and they ignored me and hide behind terms and conditions which is unfair. People lie all the time especially when Uber jacks the rates up during surge times so people have no choice so only course of action would be to lie and try getting refunded. Next drivers are required to go through the highest security and background checks to protect the riders which is great yet anyone even convicted felons can ride with Uber and not be turned down. Or junkies. Uber puts drivers at risk every day sending them to medical dispensaries for people addicted to meth and other drug. Sometimes which the meds are taken home in a lock box. This sets drivers up to be robbed, beaten or even killed!. Yet Uber doesn't care about the driver on to get that person and there narcotics home safely without violating terms and conditions. As drivers we are not able to carry any weapons, guns, batt, knives or anything that is created to be used as a weapon. Yet there are many cases of drivers being assaulted by riders and or held at gunpoint and robbed. Yet Uber does nothing to protect drivers from this. Hurry up and push the emergency button on the app if you have an emergency what a joke. Next we have tier and rider reviews they mean nothing it's just a gimmick to get drivers to drive more to make the company money. I reached the top tier diamond that was supposed to give me vip support yet it did nothing when I started having issues. My rating never fell below a 4.97 the entire time I drove. And less then 2 percent of my riders left reviews less then 5 star. Then when I stop driving for Uber as they locked me out of my account and refuse to give me the reason to give my side the vip support calls me 3 weeks later and asks me why I haven't driven with them with my status leave being so high. When I explained why to her she said oh there is nothing I can do about that I will send and email to the next team that deals with these issues yet that team is a joke and never returns any emails."}, {"review_title": "Good pay but", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay (salary + stock + bonus) and benefits (Uber credit, spending accounts, etc.)", "cons": "Now they are regularly managing out people"}], [{"review_title": "Loved it", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Oct 2022", "job_title": "DRIVER/DELIVERY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good service from company in corporate", "cons": "Passengers are a pain in the rear"}, {"review_title": "Underpaid", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Account Executive in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Team Culture, Nice office space", "cons": "Overworked and Underpaid.

Hence Uber might pay 7 dollars and they are expecting the customer to pay a three dollar or more tip. Customers understandably only tip if the service is very good and they are happy with it, and they are not obliged to tip either way, nor should they be paying for driver's wages uber should. I find customer support is very easy to get ahold of, and I like that when I finish an order another comes through on my app, fairly quick, but this is only because I have very high ratings over 95%, uber gives the most deliveries to drivers with high ratings. I do not recommend delivering for uber the number one reason uber does not treat their drivers with respect and pays next to peanuts, truly I do this job as it is really fun and I love my customers, they pay my wage not uber."}, {"review_title": "Hustle culture with toxic environment", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "One of the top compensation in the market\r\nGood brand name", "cons": "Wok-life balance is very bad in most of the teams\r\nStocks value\r\nToxic environment"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Business Development", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good good Good good Good good", "cons": "It is okay and culture is techy"}, {"review_title": "Lovely", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Driver", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "polite customers, flexible working hours, not too active", "cons": "vomiting customers, drunk and verbally aggressive passengers"}, {"review_title": "Gtreat", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Business Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great for work culture.

The team maintains a high attrition rate for the following reasons: \r\n\r\n- Low pay. The role's responsibilities are more equivalent to an assistant project manager, but with the pay of an experienced support agent. Your responsibilities include designing the support process and tailoring the message of the company's projects, tracking down stakeholders and managing reviews to ensure it's ready for launch. \r\n\r\n- Low career opportunities. A select few have made the jump into operations style roles, but it's despite their work on the content for those teams, not because of it. This is a three part issue: \r\n1. The org that develops content is separate from the team that asks for content, so there are no promotional roles your work can leverage into based on your stakeholder engagement and expansion of responsibilities. \r\n2. You're gatekept from the results of your work, so despite working alone to audit, redevelop, and launch content, of which the scope of responsibility is 100% in your hands outside of providing final approval, you'll rarely if ever receive information or have access to the data to allow you to pull that information yourself to know what impact it had. \r\n3. Which leads to the issue of the fact that Uber requires every role to be applied to, no exceptions. You're paid hourly, so you have the stigma from the rest of the company that assumes the position is more just writing words and less end-to-end content ownership and management going into the application. From there, you have to battle to prove you have the experience to be in your next role, which is incredibly hard to do when you have no access to what impact your work has on the overall company.\r\n\r\n- Overwork and burnout - They haven't been able to hire up to the level they need to to handle the amount of work coming in, but Senior Management will punish you anyways through low performance bonuses (which HR points to as the reason why their low pay actually is the same as roles in other companies that pay 20k more) and scolding for not being able to make it through everything assigned to your plate. You're simultaneously not supposed to take overtime because it impacts the team budget, but you're also supposed to clear everything off your plate, even when you communicate you have no bandwidth to take anything else on and meet your deadlines. \r\n\r\n- Management is very much a \"stop complaining\" style, than a \"We'll set better boundaries with other stakeholders and adhere to our actual role responsibilities so you're not overextended and can actually complete what's on your plate.\""}, {"review_title": "Delivery Driver", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Delivery Driver in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to choose your time.", "cons": "Not many cons here as this is part time"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Delivery Driver", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is great earning platform .", "cons": "Sometimes customer can be rude"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Eats Driver in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Scheduling Flexibility, easy laid back work", "cons": "Responsible for your own repairs and equipment"}, {"review_title": "DFW DINNER RUSH", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Rideshare Driver", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "dinner rush is about 20-25 an hour", "cons": "other than 5-10 theirs not much money to be made"}], [{"review_title": "Fun", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Delivery Driver", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Part time work allows me to choose my hours.", "cons": "My salary is heavily dependent on tips."}, {"review_title": "Ok", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Sales Consultant in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Provide opportunity for a flexible Schedule", "cons": "There is a lot of instability among management."}, {"review_title": "Uber", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Security", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Make own shift and breaks", "cons": "Gas prices got too high"}, {"review_title": "Working at Uber", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Account Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and compensation plan.", "cons": "The training is non existent.
