Drivers are rated poorly by customers without the ability to dispute the allegations and accusations. If your rating as a driver falls below 95% then you lose ALL opportunities for benefits to include, healthcare, vision, dental, discounts on vehicle maintenance. Uber Eats offers ZERO transparency for drivers who have received a bad rating/review. If there is no way of knowing why a customer left a bad rating/review, then there is no way for a driver to perform corrective action or redouble their efforts to provide better customer satisfaction. This creates a negative dynamic of working for Uber Eats. There is no way to improve service or dispute possible libel/slander/defamation of character perpetrated by customers. I am encouraging a class action lawsuit against Uber Eats if they refuse to operate within the U.S. Constitutional rights to face accusers. If we are to lose our benefits due to a statistically impossible uphill battle to increase our ratings without knowing what the specific complaints of the customer are or if they are even factually submitted, then we have a serious legal issue that needs to be corrected. Transparency of driver reviews needs to happen now or Uber Eats will find itself the defendant in a federal case. Drivers are unable to dispute bad reviews by providing evidence from app screenshots, dashcams, and other documented recordings. Drivers are losing their benefits due to having to wait at restaurants for too long to hand drivers the food, having to wait in traffic behind stop and go traffic due to vehicular collisions miles ahead (the app has not improved or evolved to divert away from slow traffic caused by vehicular collisions ahead). Drivers are at the mercy of lazy people that don't get food for themselves. Drivers put their lives at risk at every intersection to bring food to these lazy people for very little compensation.\r\n\r\nIf Uber Eats intends to continue operating within the U.S. then it needs to start adhering to U.S. law. We, as drivers in the U.S., need transparency of our negative reviews, not only to improve our service to create better customer satisfaction, but also to dispute any slanderous/libelous, defamation and accusations made by customers. If this does not happen there will eventually and inevitably be a massive class action lawsuit against Uber Eats to affect Freedom of Information. You cannot revoke employment benefits (health, dental, vision) without an appeals process to dispute allegations against drivers. It is unethical, immoral, and irresponsible. Uber Eats should know better. If these manipulative practices that harm their employees' health and restrict benefits based on non-appealable and a non-transparent review system are not confronted by corporate and CORRECTED to create a healthier dynamic, then Uber Eats will ultimately gain crippling negative attention when the massive class action lawsuit is brought at the federal level. I am giving Uber Eats a very short time-frame to confront this VERY SERIOUS issue. You have been put on notice. Create a transparent system for drivers to dispute and appeal negative reviews that are possibly libelous/slanderous. The positive outcome will be that drivers will know what their accusers claimed and improve service to make customers happier or dispute false accusations that lower the driver's rating causing wrongful loss of benefits. If our benefits are on the line and Uber Eats revokes them based on customer lies, then the dynamic is severely flawed and the lack of healthcare could cause unnecessary deaths.\r\n\r\nOther Cons: \r\n1. Customers are instructed by Uber that it is NOT NECESSARY TO TIP. This is harmful to the livelihood of employee drivers.\r\n\r\n2. Over 65% of deliveries that pop up in the app are absurdly substandard wages for the amount of time and miles to deliver the order. Most are over 20 minutes and 7 miles for less than $5. Only 24% of deliveries are on par with properly compensating drivers for risking their lives through dozens of intersections across many miles. I have my own acceptable delivery prerequisites to accept a delivery. If the delivery is more than 20 minutes to conduct then the minimum earnings I will accept is $7. I need to maintain the serviceability and the safe, proper function of my vehicle. I need to fill my vehicle with gas once a day. I put over 700 miles on my vehicle per week while working for Uber Eats and I am not anyone's slave. I will not subject myself to substandard wages or slavery. So note to customers, we turn down your slave-wage propositions to deliver your food.\r\n\r\n3. Restaurants are almost never ready with the order. On average, it takes me 8 minutes to drive to the restaurant after accepting the order on the app. Some restaurants are ready with the order before I get there. My personal observation is that the majority of restaurants keep Uber delivery drivers waiting for more than 15 minutes. I had 7 deliveries tonight in which I waited for the restaurant to give me the order for delivery. The longest wait time I endured tonight was 33 minutes at a McDonalds. THAT IS NOT \"FAST FOOD\". The delivery from McDonald's to the customer took me 14 minutes. It only took me 7 minutes to get to the McDonald's from the time I accepted the delivery order. I made less than $8 that hour. That is less than minimum wage for the hour. You will not be compensated for long wait times at restaurants. You will lose time and money waiting for food. Uber doesn't do anything to fix this.\r\n\r\n4. Uber Eats only employs people from India for their support/help hotline for drivers. The accents are ridiculously hard to understand. It's their way to save a buck by outsourcing jobs to foreigners at a fraction of the cost. It wastes driver's time whenever there is an issue that needs to be addressed and the majority of issues are inadequately addressed and rarely resolved.\r\n\r\n5. Customers will give fake addresses or incomplete addresses that cost drivers valuable time and effort. The driver will try to reach out to the customer by phone or text and only half the time will the customer actually respond. When this occurs it causes drivers to lose valuable time for zero compensation.\r\n\r\n6. Restaurants will provide Uber with phone numbers that are NOT accurate. When delivering late at night, drivers don't want to travel to a delivery pick-up only to find out the restaurant has closed for business for the day. Uber Eats does NOT remove erroneous deliveries due to restaurants being closed. When one driver gets there and marks the business as \"closed\" in the app, the app just cycles it to a different driver. Drivers try to contact the business to check if they're open only to get an error message stating that the number is not in service. This happens to me CONSTANTLY. I drive across town to a closed restaurant that I tried to call through the app with no response and receive ZERO compensation for spent fuel and time.\r\n\r\n7. The Uber Eats app itself has many issues. Quotas are not accurately recorded. Tips are not accurately recorded. You literally have no accurate accounting of how many deliveries have contributed to your quota bonuses.\r\n\r\nThere are many more problems with driving for Uber Eats.\r\nIn summary, the biggest issue with Uber Eats is waving the promise of health benefits in the faces of drivers if they can stay above 95% customer satisfaction rating of their performance, but they have ZERO processes in place to appeal or dispute their reviews. This hurts Uber Eats whether or not they acknowledge it. If Uber Eats created a feedback system by which drivers could view every individual complaint/review, then Uber Eats drivers could improve their service accordingly or dispute false allegations by providing recorded evidence that disproves the claims against the driver.\r\n\r\nNote: I personally have a GoPro concealed in my clothing, a dashcam in my car, and I screenshot every delivery from acceptance in-app to pickup at restaurant to driving to customer to the way I follow instructions in-app as well as every name associated with every address I deliver to. I RECORD EVERYTHING and in the state of Texas this is LEGAL. Texas is a single-party consent state in which everything can be recorded and used as evidence in court. I have compiled over 2,000 hours of camera recorded content into a dedicated hard-drive. If I had the ability to face my accusers that gave me a poor rating/review and addressed their claims with my own physical evidence, then Uber Eats would have to nullify the vast majority of negative reviews against me, thus reinstating my well deserved benefits."}, {"review_title": "The worst", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Quality Assurance Analyst in Cairo, Cairo Governorate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nothing at all to mention", "cons": "The worst company ever dude, run away"}, {"review_title": "Uber", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Devops Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Its good to work there", "cons": "I dont have downsides.

(must be nice to be away form the driver mayhem). \r\n\r\nExperts are required to wear an Uber-branded shirt and dress casually. Superiors tend to not wear Uber-branded shirts and often dress too casually, such as ripped jeans (like a teenager), yoga pants or ripped capris. \r\n\r\nThe drivers themselves are the biggest challenge. Greenlight Hubs have allowed a culture of intimidation and verbal abuse to become the norm. Superiors KNOW this fact but usually brush it off and go hide in their offices. Security guards have recently been brought in but many are unqualified and are there for an easy cheque to sit for 8 hours. Posters with Uber's community guidelines and behaviour rules towards Experts were taken down from the office for some reason (no reason was given. An example of the unilateral change). Experts are taught to conflict resolve, however many of these learning only work in theory and are rarely successful in practice. Superiors will normally side with the drivers and will question Experts on what they could have done differently. Many times Experts cannot do anything due to regulations, due to driver fraud, due to driver deactivation etc. and are still required to answer for this. \r\n\r\nMany drivers have enormous language barriers, are elderly or simply cannot use technology. Patience is needed for these potential drivers who are clearly unqualified and will be kicked off the platform in a matter of days for poor performance... \r\n\r\nExpert are rated after every interaction, regardless of what the visit is for. As mentioned with the culture of intimidation from drivers, oftentimes drivers will retaliate by giving Experts negative reviews and blaming Experts for being rude or incompetent when many of the issues the driver is having is beyond the Expert's hands. Common negative ratings out of Experts' hands include: licensing issues, documents being delayed in approval, police background check delays, multiple visits for a deactivated accounts.\r\nThere are no reversals for negative ratings, nor do superiors take into account why a negative review may have been left. Experts are required to answer for doing their job and relaying bad news. \r\n\r\nSuperiors will bend over backwards for drivers, even to the extent of ignoring new COVID-19 appointment-only model and accommodate drivers who have a tantrum due to this new change."}, {"review_title": "easy money", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Delivery Driver", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "easy money convenient good tips", "cons": "sometimes you don\u2019t get tips"}, {"review_title": "UberEats", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You choose when to work", "cons": "GPS on the app can be confusing."}, {"review_title": "Personal review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Aug 2021", "job_title": "IT Support Specialist in Takoma Park, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Customer Support and Great Drivers", "cons": "Nothing so far, Everything is great"}, {"review_title": "Coll place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "31 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Life work balance is great", "cons": "Halal chicken is not very great"}], [{"review_title": "drive when you want", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Driver in Oakland, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexibility, earn when you want", "cons": "pay not as good as in the past, less incentives"}, {"review_title": "Uber driver", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Delivery Driver", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good pay, can choose own hours", "cons": "Had to wait for the ride"}, {"review_title": "Uber - Amazing Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Account Representative in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible work arrangement\r\nGreat culture\r\nGreat Pay\r\nUnlimited PTO", "cons": "No matching 401K\r\nAbility to advance career"}, {"review_title": "Uber driver", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Systems Administrator in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Self employed job, manage your own schedule", "cons": "No benefits, no assistance related problem encounter during your job."}, {"review_title": "Like it so far", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Mobile Engineer in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- good work life balance\r\n- great perks\r\n- great eng culture\r\n- plenty of opportunities to make an impact.", "cons": "- A little bit heavy on corporate processes which sometimes takes away from productivity."}, {"review_title": "ok", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Human Resources Business Partner HRBP in Gurgaon, Haryana", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "smart people\ngreat office\ngood wellness perks", "cons": "too much change in the business"}, {"review_title": "Great company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Vice President", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture and great care for people", "cons": "none so far that I have come across"}, {"review_title": "n/a", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Project Specialist in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for", "cons": "The pay could be better"}, {"review_title": "Moving fast and breaking things", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 May 2021", "job_title": "Sales Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Surrounded by the best and the brightest, you will learn a ton- lots of cross functional work with a fast-paced environment", "cons": "Definitely prioritize ops > sales;
