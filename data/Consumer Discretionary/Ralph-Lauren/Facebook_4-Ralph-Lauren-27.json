You may get a raise of like, 30-50 cents after an impeccable annual review. The best pay rate jump you can expect is $1.50 when you become certified in other skills. \r\n\r\nNo cash bonuses -- that could definitely be a perk to encourage people to volunteer for more hours as opposed to just forcing all employees to have mandated overtime for months on end."}, {"review_title": "About what you'd expect as a part-time sales associate.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jan 2013", "job_title": "Sales Associate/Cashier", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The store is pretty.

But holiday weekends here are no joke. They say all hands on deck, everyone will be working, but there are usually two that get out of it. The salary managers feel they should get to do whatever they want whenever they feel. This alone caused me enough problems with associates learning this and become argumentative with supervisors, because it was well know there are no documenting out even a talk in the office. But the second one of these managers work with you everyone is working correctly making the manager seem like they are not motivating the team, or plainly not doing their job. Clearly it would have been better to bring the trouble employee and salary managers WITH the supervisor in the office to discuss everything. Employees are not likely to lie if the supervisor they were not working with was present in the discussion. Instead the employees talk only with a single manager, remember the employee always works in their presents, and tell them things like the supervisor is doing nothing or not helping the team. The employee is not aware of all the work that is being put on them by managers who can't get their personal endeavors worked out. The manager will take their word for it and get on the supervisors for not \"helping the team\". So the supervisor gets stuck doing what we pay part time associates to do just to not get any of the\" extra \" work done. Then reviews come around and you get pennies while you overhear those awful employees getting a nickel or dime more than you.

In the past 3 years, temp pay has gone from $15/hour to $20/hour, which seems like a good thing, until you realize that most full time employees are making less than $35,000/year.  The fact that hourly workers are making more than salary is pathetic.  In addition to not being paid anywhere close to industry standard, raises for regular employees are almost nonexistent.  After almost 2 years with the company being a good employee with a great review, my first annual raise was 1.3%.  Needless to say, this was insulting, especially considering other employees pulling from the same raise pool were given 8-10% for no reason other than they were in the \"chosen few\" (more below).\r\nFor some reason, (and this is from experience across multiple teams), certain employees are pegged as being the ones management likes to promote, and if you are not one of those, your chances of advancement are slim to none.  These are the people that are fast tracked through promotions and are given large raises, while everyone else is forced to stagnation whether or not they have better work ethic, drive or leadership skills.  Once you as an employee realize this, it can kill moral because no matter how many nights you stay late or how hard you may work, you will not be rewarded in any way.  There are people in the company that have been there for 10+ years still in entry level positions while others who have been there less than 3 are in supervisor and management positions.

The team at the adult store is not properly trained, so when one of their customers come into our store, and we deny them of something due to our company policy, we hear \"well the adult store did it.\" Turnover is very high, and due to this, my store manager (who was amazing) became overwhelmed with a lot of the duties that his subordinates once had, causing utter chaos. Some of the managers at the adult store are lazy and don't ever get anything done, which our DM sees, and then takes out on us when us Children store employees get our jobs done. Our DM isn't very personable, and every time he walks in the room becomes a little stiff. Employees are expect to do so much for little pay and it's very hard considering that we are not a retail store and don't get paid commission. It's hard to \"create connections\" and \"provide hospitality\" when it's you against 30+ customers in our tiny and cramped store. The uniform isn't bad (considering we can wear jeans), however wearing a navy blue top every day is quite annoying for the person who puts effort into the way they dress and those who worked for years before the uniform and established a wardrobe filled completely with RL merchandise they can't even wear anymore. Even before the uniform, we had a dress code that said that we could wear shorts and short sleeved shirts as long as we had a third item (such as a cardigan or sweater of some sort), however, this is Texas. It's 100 degrees year round. I understand we have to keep up with the aesthetic of the company, but it's way too hot to wear layers and layers of clothing. The store is very dirty in terms of hygiene and cleanliness, especially in the fall when the crickets swarm and take over the store. When it comes to shipment, we can get boxes upon boxes and have absolutely no where to put it since our stock room is so small. Shifts can be very long, but if you don't mind that, then this really isn't a con for you. In the outlet, in both the adult and children's stores, customers like to throw clothes everywhere, so if you close one particularly busy night, expect to be there for a while. Impossible to move up in the company. There are people who work right under the the new CEO who have done so, but it's hard considering that the company likes to hire new management externally as opposed to internally. There are people in our stores who are willing to move up if only they were given the chance. For company-wide contests during the holidays, prizes such as Visa gift cards and other items are advertised, but are then given in the form of Polo bucks when employees are expecting something more worth their while.

I kept the stock room in an impeccable condition and was constantly being praised by my colleagues, every corporate employee who visited and management themselves.

Before I could sit down for my interview I was told I don't have any experience (job requirements said 4yr degree in lieu of experience) so im more suited for a sales associate position. The unqualified interviewer was already aware of my work history and school hours, which meant the decision was biased. Long story short, a former assistant manger said the manager never liked me and was intimidated by my education. Manager also laughed and said \"I can't believe she applied for assistant manger, like she thinks all that stock work is gonna qualify her\". Corporate knows of this behavior, did nothing about it and is still supporting this inexperienced, unintelligent, clueless manager who relies on the \"worker bees\" to keep the store afloat. During the interview process, emailed the manger about the lack of morale, poor communication and constant confusion within the store, it wasn't received well so I was fired. I was fired (I was later told) because (1) I was constantly asking questions via email, (2) for complaining about taking an early break 3 months earlier, (3) for calling out 1time in 7months (despite others no call/no show and weekly call outs) and was told \"it's basically a combination of everything\".

The quality of the product is far below what you would expect from a company with the power and name recognition of Ralph Lauren. \r\n\r\nFrom the get go it was apparent the company is highly unorganized and not efficient when it comes to management training or overall operations of their stores. Each store is run differently based of the management style of the GM. Some are stronger than others but in most cases all of the stores managers are EXTREMELY overworked. It was very common to work 7 to 12 day stretches with 10+ hour work days because of how heavy the workload could be. On multiple, if not the majority of occasions, I would not be able to take a lunch due to conference calls, heavy workload tasks, or limited payroll for part time associates. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to be on call 24/7, even if your are using your PTO. It was common for my shift to end only to be on the phone with my General manager for hours at a time discussing how to tackle all the tasks sent through corporate with very little time frames for completion.  On countless occasions I would need to step out from spending the rare time I got with friends or family to take a call from my store. This put a huge strain in my personal life and my relationship with my partner. \r\n\r\nRequests off were typically met with a lot of push back because the business will always come first. Making it very hard to use PTO for vacations. In my experience I was told when I could use my PTO, not allowing me to plan time off with my loved ones, or plan something that would work with their schedules. I would have plan something for the week off the GM approved for me. \r\n\r\nMy schedule would be changed almost weekly without warning, typically altering days off which made it extremely hard to plan anything. If you happen to be a salaried employee like I was and you pushed back you were told \u201cthis is expected of salaried employees.\u201d You will have to cancel any appointments you may have had at the drop of a hat, check you schedule for you next day off and hope it wouldn\u2019t change. \r\n\r\nBurnout in the company is extremely high and manager dropout is a consistent problem across the outlet division. Expect your stress levels to rise as there is always an \u201cemergency\u201d that needs to be tackled almost every work day. The company culture seems to revolve around chaos even at the corporate levels. You quickly realize you are a number and not valued as a person in this company.\r\n\r\nBe cautious if you are interested in joining this company on the outlet side. It will drain you physically, emotionally, and pull you away from loved ones.
