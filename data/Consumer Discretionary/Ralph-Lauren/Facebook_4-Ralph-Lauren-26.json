Furthermore, head office is full of individuals who started as causals then got promoted to head office so they walk around with an air of superiority. On one occasion a head office lady came in on her day off with her mother pushing a massive shopping trolley, we had a store policy where shopping trolleys weren\u2019t allowed in store so I advices her to leave the trolley by the front door.

Upper management played favorites and actively made up lies about non-favorites work and personal lives in an attempt to get them fired and turn colleagues against them. I heard this with my own ears. Many people in the department were in on this and assisted in perpetuating an extremely unkind and unwelcoming environment. It was like the department thrived on the misery of people who weren't in the clique. \r\n\r\nAfter I left the company and began interviewing other places, I learned that my workload for my position was far above average and my annual pay was around $20,000 less than the going rate for people at my experience level. My work was continuously praised by my direct manager, but after MULTIPLE years of working here, my annual pay had only increased by a couple thousand dollars total.\r\n\r\nI truly cannot say enough negative things about my experience working here and would not recommend this place to anyone.
