Opportunities to get bonuses and prize money -Engagement is fun, even remotely. Lots of contests for gift cards and eBay branded stuff. Also semi-frequent gifts (ie gift cards, eBay swag, etc.) -The people are great, for the most part. A good manager will completely change your experience and make it much more positive. Lots of mentorship opportunities and the teams are great too with lots of fun banter and close relationships. You will make friends. -Great diversity and a genuinely inclusive community. Lots of cultural events and groups you can join, and a general sense of safety regardless of identity. Also great benefits for parents and LGBT+ couples -Work from home is great, and they provide all of the equipment tech wise.

Might not bother some people, but I didn\u2019t enjoy this aspect of the job. -General customer service exhaustion. People get very heated over their money, feedback, etc. This isn\u2019t specific to eBay but a down side for sure. -GIFT CARDS. Almost everyday you will talk to someone who fell for a gift card scam and there is NOTHING we can do about it. While it makes sense, I wish the system would be revalued somehow. These are also exhausting and very sad calls, and an absolute drain. -Communication between departments can be unclear and frustrating- seems to be a lack of cohesion here and you will definitely run into miscommunications and incorrect transfers -Some exciting and innovative programs and lines of business, BUT lots of complaints about these, especially once eBay became their own payment processor.

It needs to be considered that after to have covered topics about selling and buying, it stops for one week to introduce you to the mentors and do side by side/shadowing, by zoom, with them. Then, afterwards, you will be sent again to the training for the last topic, and when, this last one, is totally covered, you will be again with the mentors. Personally I found all of this very unmethodical, meaningless and bumbling, like a pawn in a chess game that is moved from one side to another constantly without a result. \r\nThe training is all theory based and all explained very fast, you cannot ask questions because the time is short for big explanation, You need to learn, in a short time, fast as you can, all the theory otherwise you are considered, from the trainers perspective as a person that slow down the class and ready to be reported. Furthermore, if the trainers cap on that you don\u2019t understand a topic covered become often impatient and rude with you. \r\n\r\nPlease note that at the end of any topic covered, while you are in the training, there is a test and needs to be passed with the 80% of the score. They don\u2019t tell you until you don\u2019t start in the company. It is mandatory to pass and you have two attempts. The failure of passing is equal to be reported to HR where there is a possibility to be let go because you are not the right fit for this company. Also, please note that if you have any issues with any of the trainers, the coach, the team lead, or manager, they are all friends and will protect each other in any way they can, even if you are right or have been bullied in any way. \r\n\r\nIn the team:\r\nAfter almost three month of training, you finally start with the team. This team is relatively new and you will only receive call transfers for customers that ask/want to speak with agents based in the European Union. The volume of the calls is very low and the management just pretend that you are really fast knowing the policies in order to solve all customer issues. Add to that, the customers are constantly angry, rude and can scream, yell, curse at you on a daily basis, they don\u2019t respect you as a human being. Moreover you can try to escalate this to your couch and superior but, instead to support you, they will evaluate you rating badly as agent and ignoring the fact that the client is shouting, cursing and yelling at you. Plus if you go to ask to the coach a quick question for advice, you will be completely ignored.\r\n\r\nPlease note that you can receive some definite intimidation from the manager that you are unable to deal with (For example, he may say that the donkey must do what the master says); you will constantly work under pressure that cannot be handled. Furthermore you have to figure things out yourself cause they don\u2019t know how to teach you and if you are not able to do so, they try to get rid of you. Team leaders and coaches are promoted in regards to who they know and not what they can bring to the table.\r\n\r\nYour performance \r\nIt is based on the rate that the customer can give to you. This can affect your score card. It is up to the customer how many star want give to you but be sure that if your score card is in red you will be put through, after one month working, in a support plan. This does make any sense because: 1) you are relatively new in the company and you have a lot to give and a lot to learn; 2) the evaluation is from the customer and is something that you cannot control. It is just customer judgment. \r\n\r\nWhen you are under this plan, you are entrusted to a coach that evaluate you. What it is missing here to help the improvement of the agent, while is in the plan, are manners, patience and politeness explaining the topics. \r\nBare in mind if you fail the plan, it is your only and unique fault and you will be let go because at the end of the day your performance card is based on the customer reviews only for 30% and the support plan is more important, even though they have told you throughout the role, that it\u2019s the other way around. \r\nAt the end of the day, If management team are unhappy with you in any way, they will make some excuse to let you go from the company. \r\n\r\nThe policies:\r\nThey are very vague, open to interpretation which leaves leeway for argumentative customers. \r\nTo this it can be added the constantly technical issues that nobody knew how to fix, not even the Tech specialist."}, {"review_title": "Amazing caring company but lack of growth opportunities", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing Top Tier Benefits\r\nFlexible schedules \r\nGreat Community and work environment\r\nUnderstanding/Caring Management", "cons": "Lack of opportunities to move up from job positions\r\nWas required to cover other departments without immediate notice or training \r\nUnrealistic expectations set which caused several burnouts with employees"}, {"review_title": "Kind of been slow", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Sales", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexibility of time needed to do it", "cons": "Seems as the costs continue to rise with service"}], [{"review_title": "New Hireee", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Data Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great atmosphere, very informative, always transparent, and overall a great company to work for.", "cons": "Not a negative comment to give."}, {"review_title": "Reasonable Place to Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Phone Support Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits, reasonable pay.

They don't have to. Believe me when I say this: You're a number, you can be replaced and they know it. But not only do they know it, they laud it over you at every opportunity available to them. \n\nRequesting time off becomes an apologetic chore. You can't just *take* time off. You need a reason. And, when or if it's approved, it's done so as 'a courtesy'. But, I mean obviously they do this, you *should* feel guilty for taking some well earned holiday days off. Shouldn't you? You're leaving your team to finish the already unachievable workload without you. How dare you? \n\nThe freedom to be creative, individual and autonomous is a lie too. You're timed. Everything you do is timed. What do I mean? Well, there is a little stopwatch type clock that appears for every task/email/project/call/break/lunch, heck, I wouldn't be surprised if they knew how long you took to go to the bathroom.\n\nEvery single thing that you do is timed and sometimes your screen will be sporadically recorded so that they can monitor the exact goings-on. You will not be notified when your screen is recorded and you won't even be notified if they request to record your screen 100% of the time. Which they do if you they believe you're not working 'the eBay way'. \n\nWhats the eBay way? Well the eBay way is their way of saying you're not popular enough amongst the team. Because oh, yeah I forgot to mention, your ability to do your job with any kind of competency is irrelevant. You just better have a smile on your face at all times, your zoom camera on, and your undeniable love for eBay on display at all times. \n\nWe don't want your opinions. We don't want to know how you think things can be done better. We don't even really want to know if you've witnessed some kind of not-okay sexually aggressive communication by another member of staff.\n\nWhich, unfortunately, I did, and I reported it. And I was ignored. And ignored. And ignored. And then told, that it was probably already looked after... sure, okay.. then why is the message still visible to everyone on the team? Why do I have to go to HR alone? Why did you lie and tell me you've already done something about this? You should help right? Am I going mad, or is that not apart of your job?\n\nWhether you're male or female, no one should have to bear witness to any kind of unapologetically misogynistic behaviour and, no one should have to watch their management team ignore it either.\n\nNo one should feel like they have to deal with something like that on their own.\n\nThis place, its great if you can sacrifice a lot. Your morals to customers - it'll be implied to remove negative reviews for top sellers. Your dignity - each team is a club, teams are small, your manager expects to be treated like a God and if s/he doesn't like the cut of your jib, not only will you hear about it, but you'll feel it too. You may even be punished for it. All those bonus' you're promised? Well they take into consideration your 'enthusiasm' for the company. What does that mean? That my friend, means it's a cult. And you'll be isolated just like a cult. Your not introduced to other teams or managers or anyone really. The hierarchy is kept purposefully ambiguous. \n\nOkay, your not gonna be asked to drink any cool-aid. No. That would cost money. Buy your own cool-aid. Better yet, say your going to buy some cool-aid and never come back."}, {"review_title": "Rate a Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 May 2022", "job_title": "Accountant in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Sincere and fair\r\nCan speak frankly within the department\r\nAccurate books and management\r\nThorough prevention of bribery and corruption\r\nContribution to social areas", "cons": "I don't feel any weaknesses.\r\nNothing in special\r\nThank you for hiring full-time employees."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Executive Assistant in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits and awesome culture / Gym on site", "cons": "Cafe is expensive.

Went through a four part interview process for an entry level position which was not as described in the actual job posting or by the recruiter. I was actually pretty excited about working for eBay when I was hired and about 4 weeks into training. Trainers and coaches really try to sell eBay as the greatest company you could work for the first couple of weeks of training. Honestly started to feel a little culty, but you believe them and you feel excited until you realize the training is a joke and it doesn\u2019t prepare you at all for the job. The amount of information that is thrown at you is overwhelming and you are expected to be an expert in all aspects of eBay. Was told everything changes frequently so don\u2019t get too comfortable. Everyone in the training class felt ill-prepared prior to taking calls. The knowledge base is very difficult to navigate. Have to navigate through multiple programs while on a call while trying to understand the member\u2019s issue within impossible time frames and metrics. Unless you actually buy and sell extensively on eBay and know about their policies beforehand, don\u2019t apply.

It sometimes felt like they were trying to hire the least skilled people in the company because they knew they would have no where else to go once realising how bad the job was. With the amount of abuse you get on calls plus the volume of calls you are expected to take every day and the non existent support from management, I don't know how they do not expect people will want to leave. Problem is, the smartest people leave, the not so smart...stay. I have come across the most racist, disrespectful, ignorant people on calls and that has been from day 1. And expect no different behavior from some of the management there. Then you get told that that's just how it is and that you have to deal with it. Great! I used to go back home every day after work and cry for a good hour because of the awful time I was having in there. I knew that most of my colleagues were feeling the same way. I could not believe I had just left my previous job for this. No one should ever have to feel this way. Honestly don't make the worst mistake of your life to take a job with them, what they advertise is NOT what you get.
