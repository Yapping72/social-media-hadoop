Working here will set you up for success should you move on internally or to other companies as I did. eBay Ireland gave me the opportunity to grow to people leader & manager of several different departments, always learning from all the very smart people around me. \r\neBay may not be a market leader when you compare them to their competitors, but that very reason makes eBay a great place to work & grow your career. They are always looking to innovate and compete with the likes of Amazon, so every opportunity to add value to customers or makes changes on site are greeted with positivity and you get the opportunity to work & implement meaningful projects. As a former employee, it still makes me excited to see changes on the eBay site that my customer support team and I conceived, actioned & implemented. \r\nAnother great pro is the people, and not just because they are all nice people, but the talent in different areas of the business is at another level.

I currently work in a big name tech company, whose turnover is 10x of eBay\u2019s, but internally, teams only do a fraction of work & innovation that eBay does.

Buyers are not happy. Employees are not happy.  Why?  Primarily because none of the above are  being listened to by eBay Executives.\r\n\r\nHuge decisions (such as the removal of Helpline, outsourcing of entire departments) are made with no imput from the people on the front lines. Workflows are changed every few weeks.  Senior Management  cannot  seem to make up their minds. Good people are then shuffled into positions that they never wanted to do, and many have ended up leaving.  \r\n\r\nEmployees work hard at eBay.  They deserved to recognized and compensated for their work and have opportunities for career growth.  If  given at all, eBay raises are low by industry standards to begin with (1.5 - 2% is common) and you cannot retain good people this way.  I have a number of co-workers who did brilliant work and then received a 2% raise - this was before the economy tanked.\r\n\r\nThe leadership is lacking at the very top.

Then things started to change... \r\nBiggest issue was outsourcing a lot of work (make no mistake the outsourcers caused issues for employees as much as they did customers with the bad work they do.) You'd have to fix stuff that outsourcers messed up or take the hit on your stats for a customer you're now dealing with after a outsourcer on your satisfaction scores because they aren't going to be happy when a outsourcer sent them to the wrong department.\r\nThe company started changing tools used around which made things more difficult for the employees.... course it's what they said would be easier to use and make work quicker (not) and how they said we could work better. The 'they' was always people whom at best watched a couple of people whom actually work then go on and decide how they figured it could be done... never mind  that if they'd ever done the csr's job they were designing tools for it was long long ago.   When I left it was said that they were going to switch to another tool.... again... however they were still making people switch from a tool that worked and didn't break down a lot to one that did on other queues in the meantime which seems rather pointless...\r\nMeetings to find out what's going on with the company and visits from managers to the various teams to touch base dropped off till many teams hardly ever saw management above their supervisors and leads and center wide meetings in the end were at best twice a year (by the time the center closes it's quite possible it will have been nearly a year with no center wide meeting).  Even email communication dropped a lot. We were hearing more via rumor than anything else when I left and were low on leadership. One team couldn't seem to hold onto leadership though it was a shift that typically wasn't popular still that says a lot. Most of the people in the fraud department were looking elsewhere for work slowly the better people tending to be the ones to go first as with many places when they start to see there may be more trouble as was many of leadership.\r\nJohn donahue is seen as pretty much a joke with many calling him Dohn Jonahue due to the fact that the company seems to have slid downwards ever since he started to be in charge.\r\nThere are some great supervisors however the level above that no longer seems to care. At the manager level it may not be completely their fault... they got rid of a lot of managers and added more duties to other managers over the last while which means they've been given more to do than is possible to get done. \r\nRewards for employees also slacked off. Promotions became more and more about who you know than what you can do. More people started to abuse the systems however they could and the few merit based rewards had at least several people making use of abusing the system that way in order to claim that."}, {"review_title": "Not the best place for above average people", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Jul 2011", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Brand Name,\r\nThe Domain Knowledge and Technical Knowledge that one would gain with any large scale e-commerce company", "cons": "eBay's home grown technologies, processes and testing methodologies are very outdated\r\nSince eBay uses it's own technologies many developers lose track of what's going on in the software technology world and as a result find harder to sell themselves outside of eBay and get stuck there for almost ever.\r\nYou can find a lot of technically incompetent people at responsible top positions making bad decisions all the time.

The closest I have come are a few engineers here and there who have lived their whole careers at eBay. They tend to know a lot about the narrow technology of eBay and how eBay does things. They tend not to know what's happening in the big world of software development outside their little worlds. In that sense they are experienced engineers with a narrow background. That said, my more common experience at eBay is that the engineers I have had the opportunity to work with are able to do their work. Not well. Not efficiently. They seem to be able to produce minimum level of accomplishment results. They pass along the work not realising that it isn't up to standards that would be expected elsewhere.\r\nProcess wise, eBay seems to be pushing towards having their teams adopt scrum as their development process.

Mediocre teams produce mediocre results no matter what process they use and eBay is mediocre all the way through.\r\nThe only other thing to mention is that on the surface there are a lot of interesting initiatives happening at eBay.

As time went on, more and more things were outsourced - more complex customer service emails, Live Chat, International questions, selling tool questions, image service questions, etc. Mumbai and the Philippines got more and more of the workload, and the quality loss was apparent. Emails could be routed for weeks between service partners, answers often had tangential or no relationship to the questions asked, and the unhappiness of the customers was obvious for anyone to see.\r\n\r\nThe niggling over metrics also increased remarkably. People were fired for missing productivity metrics by 1 or 2 percent (quite literally). The productivity metrics increased by leaps and bounds. If you got a bad quality review which was not in fact an error on your part, too bad so sad - the process to overturn a bad quality review was to appeal it to the quality team. And since the quality team was penalized for having quality review overturned, as you can imagine, reversals of quality reviews almost never happened. And customer satisfaction? You were ranked on both your satisfaction and eBay's satisfaction, so if the site was down or some feature wasn't working, that was a strike against you.\r\n\r\nManagement's decisions also became more divorced from reality as time went on. eBay Express was a wonderful example of that. No one wanted Amazon Lite, but we were going to get it anyway, come hell or high water. Meanwhile, real innovation went the way of the dodo.\r\n\r\nNow that Meg is gone, the decisions have just gotten worse and worse.

And that\u2019s why: \n1) All the company\u2019s real actions are about short term. There is no strategy behind actions in US, EU, APAC except \u201cclose the Quarter on target at any cost\u201d. Sometimes it is really funny to see how company tries to hack the top-line numbers burning LOT OF CASH on incentives and subsidies right here right now instead of thinking of how to get healthy long-term growth. \n2) Most of initiatives got killed in politics and bureaucracy. Lot of good ideas appear in different teams but most of VPs/Directors play their career game and want to make a name, bonuses, become more powerful and only after this do something good for sellers, buyers, partners. When they implement something, most of time they ignore end-users and results of their projects are creepy. Most of product development works same way: they release bad product that nobody is happy with and ask marketing to promote it hard, ignoring most of user complaints. And everybody is DAMN BUSY and not reachable for fixing their mistakes.\n3)Bureaucracy become bigger and bigger in company every year. Over a HALF of calendar is about reporting meeting or presentations for these meeting. Nobody cares about if you do right things for users, they are worried only about traction of your activity and targets. Real strategic discussions are very long and often end up with no decision. Most of time you do tactical things, then report, then repeat. This process appears on almost all functions, especially finance. Last Ariba implementation caused MONTHS of delays in contract signing and payments. Problem is still not resolved-eBay can not pay in time. Everybody knows, very few cares. \n4)Zero acceptance of critics. Over couple of years many people became \u201cso senior\u201d that you have very limited chances to hear the reply to your asks, feedback, questions. Even organization dedicated to employees feedback is ignoring questions. \n\nThe most disappointing that all these signs of eBay\u2019y eclipse can be carried and changed, but instead of it company tries to make the retouch and keep talking about \u201cwe are doing great new eBay, very very soon everything will change, just deliver!\u201d"}, {"review_title": "Taking care of employees wellbeing", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Development in Amsterdam", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great colleagues, a place where you can be yourself\r\nWorkspace is done really well, top of the line equipment (desks, chairs, monitors etc)  showing care for their staff.\r\nDiversity focus is not just a culture poster on the wall\r\nMany programs in place for caring and sharing with the community or charity\r\nGood ESPP program", "cons": "Sometimes a bit too American, adjust to your audience when doing presentations or trainings."}], [{"review_title": "Could be great -- the talent is there, just take off the shackles", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Jan 2009", "job_title": "Staff Software Engineer in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Talented employees\r\nOpportunities to work on exciting projects\r\nDevelopers get the tools needed -- no problem getting hardware, software, training", "cons": "Insane amounts of process and red tape to get anything done\r\nComplete lack of any usable documentation for anything"}, {"review_title": "Work Hard and Work Hard", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Jul 2009", "job_title": "Senior Product Marketing Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The brand name of eBay has carried a lot of weight in future jobs.

Quite a few first or second level engineering managers on QE side have absolutely NO coding or design or not even decent level of general industry or software development knowledge.

Some of them do not have any outside eBay experience and some even only work for the same product line for 10+ years.

We are fully aware of our expectations, everything is on a 'quota per hour' basis - however the addition of monitoring in the name of 'quality assurance' is detrimental to morale and does not serve a positive purpose.  If an employee is routinely performing at an 'exceeds' or 'outstanding' level - 125% + and 150% of quota, effectively doing the job of up to 2 people in production statistics, there should not be a heavy handed approach to personal use of msn or Internet.  Of course, we are adults and can fully appreciate that we are there to do a job - however a few minutes each shift for personal communication does wonders to morale and actually has been proven to assist productivity.

Fun events are a regular happening, sometimes once a week. If you have the right Manager - I do - many of the difficulties will seem less difficult.

There are many good places to eat nearby.", "cons": "If you are at a senior level, you will not find much to learn here. The opportunities to have design discussions and do work with other designers in your field are very limited. This also means you have almost no chance to mentor a younger designer either.  Projects are routinely scheduled to be much too short or way too long. Scoping of a project has not quite been figured out. There will be many things at eBay like that. You will not be able to understand why so many small companies have figured out various communications and project planning and eBay is still trying to get it right. The atmosphere is extremely meeting heavy. Reviews for projects are routinely sent to entire distribution lists making it hard to find out which ones you might actually need to be in. Products are not owned by one designer and the excessive use of external contractors means the section of the site you are working on could have other projects you would not see going on at the same time. Engineering will often find it difficult to make projects as you design them since eBay tries to keep back end developers and cares little about GUI programming. Although testing by researchers is available for some projects, there is no easy to use central repository to help you when the project does not have a long time line, so it is hard to learn from others' work. One of the most frustrating things is the review process, which is both very, very long and completely useless. Peer reviews take forever to write since you have to convert all text to 'business, values' speak. The majority of people will come out as 'average' and when someone does over perform, they often do not deserve it and seem to get the promotion not for actual innovative work, but for making up some 'new' way to design, or some other 'outside your usual job' type of project. This means the designers hoping for promotion will 'phone in' their projects and reserve their energy for these extra projects that don't translate to a better UI on the site. If your goal is to make the site easier to use for the actual users, you will be disappointed at your inability to get your designs through the review process. Which is extensive.  Further they have jumped on the patterns bandwagon a little too hard. If you have a design out of the pattern, extensive justification is required. Although you might think this makes the site more consistent, it doesn't.

The office itself is fairly vibrant, fast paced and exciting to a fresh victim just in the door.  It wasnt until I had actually been offered a final interview that I found out that the job was just a call centre operative.  They are very clever with how they word things and describe the job.  At the end of the day, it is a call centre.  After a couple of months and 7000 action plans with your coaches and team leaders that discuss your \"journey of progression in the company\" you will begin to realise just what a toxic and horrible work environment the place is.  You are told to build a rapport with the buyers and sellers and to make it feel like a personalised service but then are pulled up on spending too long on calls with customers and should be dealing with the issue promptly and moving on to the next call.  Micromanagement is not a strong enough word.  Every second is scrutinised, at the time I was working there, there is literally a member of \"leadership\" who sits there all day staring at their laptops monitoring what every member of staff is doing every second of the day.  Want or have to go to the toilet a few times a day? Be prepared to have to justify why you were away from your desk for 7 minutes combined throughout the day.  Want to book time off for a holiday? Hahaha good luck with that, unless you are booking it well over 9 months in advance.  Want Christmas or bank holidays off?  It isquite literally a lottery where names are pulled out of a hat to see who has to work.  They advertise the roles with words such as \"quarterly bonuses\",  in the near 3 years i was at ebay, i received a quarterly bonus i believe 3 times?  The bonuses are calculated by a department level and not by individual merit, you could be the perfect employee and the most productive employee in the company but because all the other kids in there are just there for a social club and dont do any work, you will receive the minimum bonus payout if you receive a bonus payout at all.  In my personal experience, my own team leaders and coaches were honestly fantastic people who helped me in more ways than just professionally. That being said however the majority of all other upper management are beyond useless.  They are supposed to be there to support you and offer help, but the second you have an irate customer on the phone looking to speak to management they all seem to magically disappear or be on their way to meetings, this then results in a formal complaint, which you are then pulled up on and asked to explain yourself.  The shift work is horrendous, they blow hot air at you constantly with their concerns over finding a good work/life balance.  You could one day be on an 8-4:30 shift, the next youre on a 12:30-21:00 and then back to a 8-4:30.  Place is like a playground, it has its little cliques and groups and if you are not part of that group then you are completely overlooked and underappreciated whilst all the kids that have bought in to the cliques get away with murder because the management couldnt possibly treat one of \"their crew\" poorly.  Constant changes to the sites functionality and costs are rolled out with little or no notice and you are expected to just roll with it and \"turn customers negative comments in to positive growth opportunities\".  You are told that you are to be your customers go to person and take ownership of issues from start to finish and to deliver a 5X experience.  In reality the buck is passed from one useless agent who doesnt want to be moaned at to another useless agent that isnt bothered doing the work .  Customers have actually been banned or restricted from using eBay if they contact eBay too often because they have been fobbed off and issues have not been resolved.  I could honestly go on and on and on about how negative the place is.  Hard work is \"rewarded\" with a patronising pat on the back certificate that a 5 year old could make on clipart and sometimes a piece of branded merchandise (an ebay cup etc). I left eBay a few months ago as i just couldnt physichally or mentally deal with the place any more.  When i informed the leadership of this, rather than see if there was anything that could be done, they just informed me that i was required to work my 4 weeks notice (i didnt, i walked out then and there).  The second I walked out of those doors i felt liberated and havent given it a second thought until i decided to write this review.  If you are taking a job in eBay, the first few months are pretty great but you will soon realise that you are just a number, they couldn't care less about your physical or mental health and I would seriously think twice."}, {"review_title": "Great company, great purpose, no leadership, no willingness to admit mistakes", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Sept 2008", "job_title": "Senior Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "eBay has a great purpose, very talented and dedicated people and despite what people may think in the Valleym an incredible brand", "cons": "There is tremendous management focus on the near-term financial targets and an unwillingness to to admit mistakes and do what is right."}, {"review_title": "A rewarding challenge for problem solvers and thrill seekers", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Nov 2008", "job_title": "Senior Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a work environment sure to challenge the ambitious and reward the successful.

They see employees as a commodity rather than people.   Because of this there is a huge divide between permanent employees and those on a contract.....  contractors are seen as second class employees and they are often exploited and bullied.  eBay uses a employment agency for most of their contractors but they also have another complex layer of employees.   They outsource their account management team to TTEC who also work on the same floor as other ebay employees and aren't integrated with the rest.  Ebay says they are ONE TEAM which is a HUGE  lie.  \r\n\r\n***how to become a permanent employee****\r\nYou have either be in a director role or have sold your soul to the leadership team by sucking up to them or 3 years.....they do this, again, to exploit and blind new employees.  They get them excited because they are working for a well-known brand but they won't tell you the truth about toxic culture.\r\n\r\n***Leadership Team are Elitists****\r\nThe leadership team is clique-y, condescending, and won't listen to any of your concerns because if you have been brought in as an AWF (Alternaive Workforce Employee) you don't have a voice.... you're a contractor and seen as fill-in to get the work done, despite if you have worked for the company for over 2 years or more.  You will be treated differently as an AWF and be seen as second class employee.  There is a lot of talent who have been brought in as AWFs... some are people managers and others have extensive experience within their discipline, but that won't matter.\r\n\r\nThe senior leadership team will palm you off, ignore your concerns, and will talk about you behind your back before investigating real concerns.  It's high school all over again.  And if you don't drink or aren't a party animal, you will be seen as an outcast.  They will bulldoze you with their huge egos.  \r\n\r\n****They Will Use You******\r\nMy last week at eBay I asked to hand over some major projects to my boss who is located in Asia, but she cancelled my video conference call.  So I then asked for her boss to be present, but he also cancelled and didn't see me off.  \r\n\r\nI've brought this up to HR but they didn't care.  They're not much help either.\r\n\r\nSteer away from eBay.

Before I started at eBay, I had heard from friends that when eBay and PayPal separated, all the normal people went to PayPal while all the lunatics stayed behind at eBay.   During my time there, I learned the hard way how true this was.  \r\n\r\nI worked for an absolutely toxic manager who had no business managing other people.  She still worked at eBay even though this was well-known around the company and she had a number of HR complaints against her.  Not only was she grossly incompetent, she also was pitifully insecure, malicious and morally bankrupt.  A manager who exhibits even one of these characteristics would already be difficult to work with.  A manager who has all these qualities made for an experience that was horrific beyond comprehension.  If you suggested a different approach on a project, rather than considering the merits of your suggestion, her first instinct would be to accuse you of questioning her expertise and undermining her authority.  She also would do everything she can to try to destroy you.  She once fired a teammate because he had the audacity to disagree with her in a meeting in front of management.  She also was not above making up lies in order to make this happen.  For me, the last straw came when she ordered me to do something illegal because she was mad at one of our business partners and wanted to get back at him.  She also tried to set this up in such a way that I would be the fall guy if anyone found out.\r\n\r\nThis experience was not unique to me.  I had many colleagues who faced similar bullying, mistreatment and abuse and who left as a result.  In my experience, the culture at eBay was toxic and pernicious across the board.  On an interesting side note - the entire company also seems to have a huge chip on its shoulder.  Employees delude themselves into thinking that eBay and Amazon are somehow competitors.  (For anyone who does not know, Amazon left eBay in the dust years ago.)

Promotions go to the wrong people (i.e. A handicapped female with no experience instead of a qualified, knowledgable employee). They participate in outsourcing to India. eBay became a company I was ashamed to admit I worked for. They have developed a bad reputation due to all the fraud on the site, high fees, and their poor customer service. \r\n\r\nThey prefer quantity over quality for customer service. Management frequently held off site lunch \"meetings\" leaving no one to help if an issue came up with a customer that required escalation. Supervisors and Team Leads would avoid escalations as much as possible and were never helpful. Supervisors and Team Leads were hypocritical, would not listen to the concerns of their team, and always put business first. Salary is only average. Several long time employees either quit or were fired due to eBay's ridiculous productivity metrics. Several supervisors gave me empty promises and false hopes of providing training to help get promoted during my years of employment. Couldn't clock in more than 5 minutes early or 5 minutes late without receiving a hit on attendance. \r\n\r\nSome employees had to share desks. No roaming profiles on PCs.

Being outdated it still relies on paying more money and doesn't do simple things like providing food which is now common in most Bay Area startups.

I watched people I could walk circles around in stats and knowledge of the company and it's policies, but they were moved up after doing minimal work because they kissed the bosses butt every day. Because I wouldn't play their game of politics you immediately get stuck in your role because they won't write a good referral to you (it's required for most roles), and you don't get any projects that allow you to grow and network. In the department I left, people were having mental breakdowns on a regular basis because not only do you have angry customers, management is the worst it could be with just thinking you're a number. On a team of 20, at that time, 7 of us went on disability because of what they put us through. Management never could figure out why we were all leaving, even though our happiness surveys were all brutally honest.  \r\n\r\nHad multiple meetings where team leader told us if you had a break that was even 1 second longer than the 15 minutes, you were stealing from the company and they will fire you on the spot. Also had meetings where management would scream and yell about how awful we're doing with business scores then demand we be the happiest people on earth or they were writing us up because they're tired of the low morale. (This is the best way to make people happy, yell!)\r\n\r\nCompany can't figure out what it wants to be.

Went to HR to quote the employee handbook multiple times, but HR basically laughed and said the supervisor gets to make that rule up and the handbook is only a spirited guideline. \r\n\r\nWhen you tell management about how you're actually feeling about the company, they just stand there and tell you why you're stupid.

Individual supervisors can be fantastic. Pay is OK.

Decisions are without a clear understanding of their eventual impact. \r\n\r\nRapid changes in policy and expectations breed contempt and low morale from the front line employees. \r\n\r\nUnkept promises with regards to work functions and load are taking a toll on employee loyalty. \r\n\r\nConsistently bad resource planning means that, even if you've been 'promoted' into a position where you're dealing with higher value customers you're still getting inundated with general support contacts which then, in turn, lowers the effectiveness of your ability to support your own customer group by increasing wait times and creating an artificial urgency in getting people out of the contact so that you can move on to the next customer.\r\n\r\nApparent disdain for customers in general - making policies that are decidedly unfriendly to the seller populace and not being transparent with the reasons for doing so - providing talking points like \"it's the cost of doing business\" which does nothing to assuage the frustration and anger felt by long term incredibly high value members when they feel that they are being treated unfairly. \r\n\r\nDramatic shifts in expectations for work performance - going from \"we don't care about your handle time\" to \"You must get your customers off the phone in an average of just over x minutes or else we'll start moving towards getting rid of you.\" is frustrating. Making these changes during the holiday season made morale take a nose dive and they're not doing anything to really discuss this, acknowledge it as a mistake, or make up for it in any way. \r\n\r\nThe sole value of an employee is their stats - handle time, customer sat, schedule adherence, etc...  There is a growing feeling that teammates are merely cogs in a machine and that anything they do extra  is seen as taking away from these stats and, while lip service is given to their benefit, no compensation or recognition is provided for that investment or engagement. This leads teammates to simply go in and do their work and leave.\r\n\r\nThere is no recognition for employees that take the time to learn more information about other lines of business and successfully apply that to their customer contacts. In fact, the more you know, the more crap they throw at you, so it's almost worth it to just stay at a base level. The pay is the same anyway. \r\n\r\nThere is no differentiation between sick time & paid time off. The standard line given is that eBay gives competitive PTO, which I guess is right, but you can't actually get sick without having the potential for some disciplinary action taking place. Other employers in the area have sick time and have built in policies for exceptionally short term (3 days or so) family care so you can take care of your sick kid. None of those things impact your attendance. With eBay, if you're sick and don't pre plan it, you get an occurrence. If you wrack up 3, you start to lose options for promotions and other benefits. \r\n\r\nThe culture has deteriorated over the course of the last several years. At first, this was the most fantastic place to work - even if customer contacts were frustrating, the management team had your back and there was a spirit of cooperation that was present at all levels of management. Now that cooperation is at the teammate level and everything higher than that discourages going out of your way to do the right thing for a customer or a peer. \r\n\r\nWhat was once a refreshingly positive work environment and a company I could feel proud of is now a mere shadow of its former glory. It's going to take removing some senior leadership and replacing them with a strong leader with a vision of culture and organizational health and effectiveness to turn this around.

There are also about 40-50 employees from PayPal, eBay Treasury and StubHub. \r\n\r\nJoined eBay few years ago with great energy and motivation to improve and develop our messy processes in billing and finance. This energy and motivation have gone away after a while when I realized:\r\n\r\n1. Whatever you achieve it seems like a drop in the ocean because management cannot focus and deliver elementary goals. The culture of management is \"Fire! Let's work on 100 different projects to improve our business\"... after debating, long discussions and hundreds of hours of work... guess what? 80-90% of the the projects are cancelled with the excuse \"are not relevant anymore\" and the remaining are delivered with significantly below quality standards expectations.\r\n\r\n2. The performance evaluation and recognition of each employee is not based on objective performance of individual. It rather depends on your connections with management. In other words, it doesn't  matter if you have worked very hard and achieved great results for the business. Someone else with basic performance and good connections with management can achieve better performance rating from you. This has a result talented people to leave eBay after few months/years. For the Luxembourg office, more than 8 employees (out of a team of 12!) left the company in last few years - a really high turnover.\r\n\r\n3. One of the benefits that management \"sells\" at interviews with potential candidates is the great career development and progression - which is probably another lie. It is really difficult to develop and progress your career at eBay, especially  in Luxembourg. The trainings are very  limited due to budget restrictions for development that we have the last 2 years.    \r\n\r\nIf you are unemployed and desperate to find a job, eBay in Luxembourg might be a good option.
