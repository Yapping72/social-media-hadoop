Lack of diversity in core area of ebay (engineering and technology) where about less than 2% are Black and Latino in engineering related job roles (software developers, Quality, data scientists/ analysts, Product owners/managers etc.) and almost none in director or VP leadership.

I worked there as a Risk teammate, which in fact is just a customer care role. They come up with these fancy names for the role because they know how bad they are. They also say in the job description that you will be dealing with chat, email and phone calls, but that\u2019s not true. It is just phone calls, loads of them. Don\u2019t expect to have time for anything. You will be getting calls every 5 seconds, and it doesn't take less than that because the system takes some time to connect the call to the user\u2019s account, otherwise it would be every second, it is insanely busy. You need to stay on the phone all the time. If you need 1 min to do something, and I mean, anything, you will need to ask your TL\u2019s permission. If you get off the phone (changing your status on the system from \u201cavailable\u201d to \u201cproactive\u201d for example), without asking for permission, your team lead will message you asking why you are not on \u201cAvailable\u201d taking calls, the micromanagement is unreal, never seen anything like that in my 10 years working in customer service. Sometimes, you need to send a follow-up email to the customer (very rare, but it happens), and even for that, which is part of your job, you still need to ask for permission so you can get off the phone for a few minutes, otherwise, you will have to write and send the email while taking another call and talking to a different customer. It\u2019s madness. On top of that, you have only 30 seconds of after call work, so after each call, you have 30 seconds to write your notes and go back on \u201cAvailable\u201d to get another call which will take 5 seconds as I said before. You get to get from 70 to 90 phone calls a day, with no time to rest, or do anything at all, except for your short breaks and 30 min lunch break. No mention the very tough calls you get from angry customers screaming at you at 8 am. And to be honest, I don\u2019t even blame them because the platform is all buggy, the policies are so contradictory and confusing and most of the time the customers are right, but there\u2019s nothing you can do apart from listening to them screaming at you, and then, 30 seconds to write your notes, recompose yourself and get another call. I was there for 3 months, and thankfully managed to get another job in a different company, otherwise, I would\u2019ve gotten sick. I won\u2019t even get into the targets, short brakes, training, lack of information, lack of communication, extensively and confusing workflows because it\u2019s a completely unrealistic joke.

Not exaggerating there is literally none.", "cons": "I've worked in various customer support and call center roles over the year I can honestly say eBay is absolutely the worst. I'll try breakdown the specific areas. \r\n\r\nContract: eBay are very cleaver on how they word their job offers. If it was a product on their site it would be taken down for false advertising. Their \"competitive salary\" is a pittance and not comparable with other companies of similar size. On paper they offer the standard amount of holiday as required by law but when you actual go to take them you see that each day is blocked to only allow a certain number of people off a day. Now this is standard but the system only allowed for 3/4 (out of a team of nearly 50) to be off at a time. There is zero, and this must be emphasized for effect, ZERO flexibility. Need a weekend off for a last minute event? Sorry should have applied for it when it became available 6 months ago. There is no established system to deal with swaps resulting in an email inbox full of requests. Forget all that talk about progression and advancement. The opportunities are just not there to move to a senior role. What you can look forward to is moving to Concierge BUT are these awarded fairly? Are they hell! It doesn't matter if you have been there years or a wet 6 months, if you are besties with the managers you go up. \r\n\r\nShifts: Kiss your work life balance goodbye. Shifts change weekly and can be anywhere from 8am to 10pm. People are clamoring for a fixed pattern but they will only go to certain people (more on that later). Flexibility? A foreign concept to eBay. You are basically told to put up and shut up. \r\n\r\nWorking conditions: As we are now working from home due to circumstances I will outline the experience from before. eBay is split across 2 buildings about a kilometer apart. There is stark divide between not just the buildings but the floors even with no effort to mix staff. They use hotdesking which adds nothing to morale. If you are on a late shift you better enjoy the hunt for a computer where the keyboard screen and mouse all work and meet basic hygiene standards. Worse on weekends when using the main office and technology at least 5 years out of date. I have worked for other large multinationals in Ireland and basic amenities such as free snacks or a free canteen would be laughable in eBay. \r\n\r\nYou are constantly being watched in eBay. Your life is dominated by the clock. If you are a minute (and I am talking 10 seconds here) back late from a break on in clocking in the morning you will be called in to explain. The same does not apply if you are delayed taking your break. Your breaks consist of 2 breaks of 15 minutes and 1 of 30 minutes but their is no logic into how these breaks are allocated. For example you could be on a 9-5.30 shift and have a 15 break at 11.30 and then your 30 minute at 12.30. Changing these breaks is impossible and complaining is pointless (more on this below). \r\n\r\nThere is someone there whos only job is watch who is not available to take calls. This is expected but due to the call volume you will not have time to do any follow up. If a customers issue cannot be resolved on first contact, which can be the case, you are told to pause it and resolve later but as you are not given the time to resolve this the issue is left. In theory a 30 minute slot is built in to the schedule for resolving cases but it is common thing that this time is cut due to call volume. Requests for this time, or anytime, to work on the growing backlog are ignored. Staff are timed for bathroom breaks and called out if too long is taken to relieve oneself. Even those in prison are allowed go to the toilet when needed. \r\n\r\nCustomers and Call volume: I will agree starting off that the company cannot control what is said on a call but they can control what is done when a customer is abusive. In my time with eBay I have been called every name under the sun. I have been threated with violence, sexual assault and yes even murder! I am not thin skinned but they get to you and management do not care. I was once told it is my job to deal with it. The call volume is the highest I have ever seen in a customer service job. Be prepared to deal with 50/60 calls a day. If they could make us take 2 calls at a time they would. You are pretty much left to drown on a difficult call because management are nowhere to be seen. Most will be routine (monotonous) but as expected there will be the difficult call and there will be no help available.\r\n\r\nMetrics: You will be a slave to the metrics, most of which are outside your control. Your \"bonus\" is tied to team metrics so you can have top metrics but because the department didn't hit target you get nothing.... no I correct myself you might get a badly done up certificate. Bad review are what they are but unfair reviews have no appeal. If you did everything you could do to help the customer but they still mark you down too bad. Worse reviews with abuse the police would prosecute for have no appeal to be removed and you are told it happens. You are reviewed on recontact rate, so people calling back within a period, something you have no control over if it is 2 separate issues. If you are lucky you might get a pizza lunch or a doughnut as a way to make you think they care. \r\n\r\nManagement: I don't know the requirements for hiring a manager in eBay but they cant be that high. The team leaders are the core of the issues. Now I get it they have a job to do but they are constantly in a meeting so when you need them they are nowhere around. When you can get them they don't want to hear your issue. You will practically have to drag them kicking and screaming to take over a call when a customer asks for a manager but at this stage I am not even surprised when they immediately give into the customer and give them what they want even if it is in no way warranted. They just want to get off the call. Managers in eBay play favouritism in a way I have never seen before. Certain staff know they are untouchable and get away with something others would be fired before because they are friends with the manager. The coaches are... pointless really coz there just is no coaching. \r\n\r\nSo overall, the place is a disaster. You will face abuse from customers and abuse from the managers while working in conditions a slave would envy."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "13 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Growth Advisor in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits.

Good colleagues.", "cons": "They will promise you all the support in the world but especially working from home, this will never be fulfilled. Your left mostly on your own with no help, ESPECIALLY on weekends. Questions put into their online space are often skipped/missed and you often must pause issues that could have been dealt with quickly on the calls due to this. The Knowledge base they have in place is so expansive that it is extremely hard to find anything rendering it completely useless. Management play favourites - nothing new or exclusive to eBay.\r\nIf you have any sort of mental health issues, I would STEER CLEAR of eBay. Management will wave \"mental health first aid training\" around but this is mostly so they can deal with and identify for themselves anyone possibly struggling. This \u201ctraining\u201d is not helpful for anyone honest and upfront about existing issues. They do not actually help staff when there is a mental health issue.\r\nPrepare to be abused on calls daily despite what they say, these calls are not few and far between. Members will scream abuse at you to try and get what they want, and you will have to get permission from management to end this call if you can get a hold of someone. Management are not on the same page at all and you will never get a straight answer from anyone. Some management will tell you to give 3 warnings and end the call but if you do this and someone else is on duty they'll more than likely tell you this is wrong and tell you something completely different.\r\nReading though some of the other reviews I am shocked to see that people thought the training was great. This for me was bare bones. Again, you cannot get a straight answer out of the trainers. They will answer questions with the same answers simply different phrasing. You go through 8 weeks training that means nothing other than \u201cread the knowledge base\u201d and then they push you in the deep end and wave from the shoreline while you drown. You only get a breather of 5 seconds in between calls which leads to burnout and stress. Management this 7.5 minute per call is achievable due to 60% of the department hitting it. They do not take into consideration that most of that 60% are in Bangalore and the Philippines where teammates do what they want to avoid the abuse and racism from the callers. This then leads to more abusive calls for team mates following the rules and policies. God forbid you would try and get some offline time for the back up of work you have from the lack of answers.\r\nExpect management to throw you under the bus on escalation calls. They will tell you to advise management will tell the customer the same thing. This is a lie. Management do not want to take these calls live, even though this is stated as process in the KB. \r\nIf you have an issue, again specific to Working from Home, their IT team is less than useless. I had an ongoing phone issue that was fixed by a level 2 technician after a 30-minute phone call AFTER 2 WEEKS OF CHASING EVERYDAY.\r\nSuper short breaks. Two 15-minute breaks (sometimes an hour after you start) and one 30-minute break. This leaves no time to really do anything or get some fresh air. \r\nThe recruitment team did a fantastic job of selling the role as a dream, but it is more like a night terror. Customer surveys affect your bonus. It counts for 40% which is disgusting as this is not something within your control WHATSOEVER. Customers give you back CSATs for stuff totally outside of your control or thinking it is for another company and eBay refuse to remove them and you therefore do not get a bonus.\r\nI had to leave this toxic waste pit of a company for my own mental health.

As a team lead, I have heard numerous times where leaders bad mouth the people they are supposed to be leading, talk down to them in meetings, and black ball them from promoting within because they (the leader) did not like them. Managers are clearly aware of what is going on, but they fall into the same toxic mindset of \"protecting their own\" because it's easier to hire an entry level agent than hire another leader.\r\nThere is no system of checks and balances with leadership which allows them to continue to abuse their power and position. Corporate tries to let people know that they can call HR, but the team leads and managers make people feel as if they will be fired or blackballed for doing so, so hardly anyone ever does. \r\nEach week, it felt like another person was going on a mental health leave and after talking to numerous people, they all agreed that their leadership was a major contributing factor to their rapid mental decline.

Promotions are based on who likes you enough to fight for you not your actual merit as an employee. It is definitely a boys club with lots of men who do not treat women with the same level of respect as their male counterparts. If you even bother going to HR about unfair treatment, you will end up worse off than before.\r\n\r\nVery political. People don\u2019t hold business partners accountable because they don\u2019t want to get negative feedback from them, which would hurt their chances of being promoted. You have people and teams fighting over who gets credit for work. It can be a huge challenge to get people to share information that you need to do your job. \r\n\r\nWay too many consultants. eBay pays big money to have consultants (and the Strategy team), who don\u2019t understand the business, make pretty decks.

You would be working on something very hard and all of a sudden your boss tells you this project is scraped and start working on other maintenance work. There is no respect/say for individual contributors. ebay is loosing its battle with other big e-commerce giants and is finding tough to retain top talent for the same reason.\r\nAfter the split. no major initiative has been taken. Entire 2015 went in poor decision making and then remaking. Apart for ebay on mobile being in the forefront, I do not see any innovation or willingness to nurture latest technology and  outshine. Senior management is very proud of the money that ebay makes, but the fact is that all that money comes irrespective of the new work that people do.

Who owned/owns what is sometimes not even documented. You will often find yourself wondering how anything works at all.\r\n- A lot of in-house and archaic technology. eBay has had a massive case of NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome. They have their own libraries, build tools, web frameworks, IDEs, front-end frameworks, logging and monitoring solutions, and so on. Some of these are very poorly designed, poorly documented, and poorly supported. There is not much push to switch to open source solutions with large communities and support. It's extremely difficult to deal with this. Much more so than you might think at the outset. \r\n- Due to the above aspects, the longer you stay in the company, the more you lose relevance in the industry.

There's alot of involvement over the holidays and throughout the year in different organizations. It's a casual environment and the immediate managers are completely great, on your level and willing to work with you on anything. We have coaches that help guide our careers and help us grow. There's also great benefits, like I've not experienced anywhere else.", "cons": "Our entire job performance is now based on customer reviews, and it doesn't matter if it was a policy you didnt write, or if the review was actually for another member who took the call and passed it to you, its then yours. Every day, I come into a job, that is looking more and more like other places I've worked. Moral is low, the excitement to excel has ceased. You come into work and you're confronted with what you did wrong, or a situation a member is upset about. You then get the chance to justify it or explain the situation, but ultimately, its going to be the cost of your bonuses. You and your team, get reviewed together too, so if one person is doing poorly, its everyone who suffers. Furthermore, they fish for feedback from members by sending emails to ask for them to respond, so if someone had a call with an agent and it went poorly, and then we email about their experience and they say it was horrible, and you get that email to respond too, then their experience is then attached to YOU, not the person who took the call. The whole thing is really unfair and unethical. It doesn't give a good glimpse of an agents actual work."}, {"review_title": "Great Experience!", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Sept 2009", "job_title": "Team Lead in Burnaby, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people at eBay were amazing, they made it fun to come in to work.
