People are generally nice, minimal/no office politics\r\n\r\n2. Everyone is willing to share and offer help when necessary", "cons": "1. Brief hierarchy of the company: Team Assistant (TA); Associate; Senior Associate; So on and so forth. If you just graduate from NUS/NTU/SMU, the entry level position offered to you will be Associate. If you're from any other local/private unis in SG, the entry level position the company deem suited for you is TA. So you may graduate the same year as your friend but they may be your superior because of your school:) These are applicable for fresh grads and majority of the teams only. \r\n\r\nTLDR, as a TA, you're basically everybody's assistant. You take instructions from anyone above your \"rank\"\r\n\r\n2. Your day end at 7PM, so naturally you will miss your usual dinner time with your family and friends taking into consideration the travel time. (Timing can never match with your friends unless they starve and wait for you)\r\n\r\n3. OT is norm and not paid (you feel elated when you're able to get out of office on time and still see bright sky lol. dont try to plan anything outside of work cause tasks are unpredictable and you may be given a task at 630PM and they expect you to complete asap)\r\n\r\n4. Managers check in with you time to time and after sharing your concerns, work are still given to you (mgrs check for the sake of checking, they also need to report mah)\r\n\r\n5. People are still working on leave/after office hours. Receiving messages and emails at 12AM? norm\r\n\r\n6. If you speak chinese\r\na) awesome cause you can 'blend\" in easier and mgrs are generally glad to hear that you speak their mother tongue language\r\nb)boo cause you need to help your non-chinese speaking teammates (not their fault btw) with their work AKA translation. ppl from other teams will prefer to seek help from you than your teammate since they can communicate better with you in their language\r\n\r\n7. No clear career progression, job scope not defined (always doing work with no background given)\r\n\r\n8. Turnover rate high. around half of my teammates has left after staying for less than 6 months or before their 3 months probation. The burnout is real:)\r\n\r\n9. Work is extremely manual. Time spent on Crtl C + Crtl V takes up your whole day, thats why the company needs TA\r\n\r\n10. The only time you get to interact with your teammates is lunch time/ team bonding session (usually held after work but will still attend cause FOMO)"}, {"review_title": "A sinking ship", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Associate in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "+ People are collaborative and it's easy to get help from someone on a different team + Working with similarly-aged peers", "cons": "1) Lack of inspiring leadership from middle to senior management. - Management are usually parachuted from other departments without relevant experience (except working for the company). \r\n-Authoritarian leadership that does not allow room for differing opinions. Many managers have no choice but to execute decisions of senior management. \r\n- Decisions are often made in a knee-jerk manner, makes you wonder if the Management has any long term vision. E.g. Birthday leave was retracted less than 1 year after roll out; the direction for employees to book a seat via internal app was reversed less than 1 month after roll out.\r\n - Lack of trust for employees. It wasn't enough to enforce 5 days work from office, this was followed with an attendance tracking system to monitor time in office. \r\n\r\n2) Elitism. Significantly different pay for the same role, depending on whether you are from local or private uni, or the honours class you graduated with. Recruiters ask for education transcripts from 'O' levels to university to benchmark you. \r\n\r\n3) Slave driving culture. You don't get rewarded for volunteering to take on additional scopes but get a below-average performance grade instead.\r\n\r\n 4) Cost cutting is now the ultimate priority and done at all expense, including that of the welfare of employees. Welfare and benefits have been severely cut."}, {"review_title": "Can be better", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Key Account Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Colleagues are fun to be with, everybody wants to get their job done", "cons": "Management should seriously review their priorities and focus - stop policing our attendance when we still get our job done"}, {"review_title": "Chill coworkers and manager", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Intern in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Nice office - coworkers were friendly - good office snacks - no OT - practice communications with different stakeholders", "cons": "- work can be repetitive - Didn't learn much practical skills"}, {"review_title": "The company doesn't care about quality", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Give you a lot of autonomy (could be to the point you think they don't care about you)", "cons": "Just doing a bunch of projects with poor quality instead of improving the quality of existing products is how you get promoted, and it's a cultural problem because everyone is doing that, the people who care about quality and try to improve the products will have a huge disadvantage compared to those creating more debt for the incomers."}, {"review_title": "On a downhill since start of 2022", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Regional Operations Associate in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-colleagues are nice and approachable. \r\n-located at one north, quite nice office environment. \r\n-pantry (albeit has dropped in size and quality)", "cons": "-MANDATORY WORK FROM OFFICE 100% EVERYDAY \r\n\r\n-Attendance tracking (as of 14 Nov) to make sure employees are monitored to the minute.

Blue-collared workers stamping a time sheet? \r\n\r\n-Upper management changing workplace arrangements on a whim. Hot desk system was implemented and significant resources were poured into developing an app for booking tables. Then suddenly came the announcement to go back to 5 day full WFO.

This makes job security an even greater concern. \n4. Lack of empathy: Unhappiness has been rife with the rising inflation, falling stock prices and general poor welfare and morale.

The mainland culture. \r\nYou'll see a lot of reviews here call out the fact that 90% of the company is from mainland. This is true and think very carefully on whether you want to be in a company like this because your culture might not be compatible at all. Documents, meetings and daily conversations will be in mandarin, and if you're not a native speaker, expect very awkward english conversations where things are lost in translation. This is Singapore, i expected it to be a company with at least majority Singaporeans, i was wrong. \r\n\r\n2. Lack of on-boarding process and guidance\r\nIf you're hoping for a smooth transition into the job scope, with managers guiding you? You are very wrong. There is zero guidance, you're expected to find everything and everyone yourself, and with no clear organisational chart and high turnover, you'll start to become super lost and become demotivated within your first week. New positions are being created all the time with zero visibility or communication between management, so you won't even know which department is in charge of what processes. It's EXTREMELY messy.\r\n\r\n3. The messiest processes \r\nNOTHING IS DEFINED AND DOCUMENTED. THERE IS ZERO SOP/CLEAR PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR TO DO YOUR JOB. Everyone just chucks data/document everywhere, it is not organised at all. There is no defined processes to approach certain tasks so you'll have no idea where/how to start or if what you're doing even makes sense. \r\n\r\n4. Lack of career progression\r\nBefore coming in, I believed I would be able to gain some skills for career progression. As it turns out, its the blind leading the blind here. Very vague communication or clear direction on what you're job expectations it and no training whatsoever. It's very unclear what the upward career progression path is. Maybe this is why they hire fresh grads or staff below 30, so everyone is just as equally as lost and won't get progressed? \r\n\r\n5. Job description vs reality of job\r\nPlease ignore the messages from recruiters, they are tasked to hire you and will tell you what you want to hear. I've been sweet talked into a job with Shopee, throwing away a perfect good career path and now I'm in the worst possible position. What the recruiters tell you is the JD is probably 50% of the truth, they won't know the full extend of your JD because it is written by your line managers. You'll only find out about your full JD when you start the job, and by then it's too late. Often, your true JD includes MUCH more responsibilities than the JD, with almost impossible tasks for one person. \r\n\r\n6. Treatment of employees\r\nYou are a number. Look at the recent articles on how they have rescinded offers, leaving potential employees jobless and stranded! Also, they had decided to exit 4 countries in Latin America OVERNIGHT! Those poor guys in those offices woke up without a job! What kind of a company does that? Tell anyone you work and shopee, and their reaction tells you the full picture.\r\n\r\nI ignored all the CLEAR red flags in hopes to find something good, I was dead wrong and now I am paying the price.

I probably can write for 100,000 words, or even more. I regretted picking this offer and stayed there for more than one year. I already left the job several months ago --- but my body is not healthy anymore (caused by OT)... insomnia and depression are still following me.\n\nYou can come if you have an MBA degree or you've worked for those \"big names\" that the company likes. \nThis company tends to value MBA, so they hired a lot of MBAs, and these MBAs have a high chance to be your manager. So, good luck :) \nThere're a lot of first-time managers in the company; the opportunity to get a good manager is 1/10. If you're a fresh grad, please, take those better companies and then jump after several years. It's too hard for fresh kids to know how to escape from abusive bosses.\n\nFun facts:\n\u3002EVERYONE NEEDS TO OT, ESPECIALLY SEAMONEY. DON\"T BELIEVE HR's WLB WORDS. \n\u3002You need to OT to show you're \"valuable\" to them. They will tell you they reward \"hard-working\" colleagues. DON\"T OT AT HOME, cause your boss won't care :) If you want to show them you're hard-working, DO IT IN THE OFFICE. Otherwise, no one will value you. ----- THIS IS HOW TOXIC THE CULTURE IS.\n\u3002When you escalate your boss's issue to your boss's boss, most of the time, you'll get ignored. Cause they want you to \"TRY HARDER\". And they'll also tell you you're just whining --- no one cares how you feel.\n\u3002Don't think work more you'll get more rewards. It's not for PM. It's for devs. There's no clear KPI or OKR for PMs at Shopee. So if you don't know how to bluff, just don't OT, go home at 7, cause no matter how you work, you'll get the same amount --- there's nothing for them to estimate your performance, everything is by impression or boss's GUT FEELING.\n\u3002They solve issue by removing those people who creates the issue.\n\u3002NO STRUCTURE AND DIRECTION. Everything comes from the big boss. PMs are just executing machines.\n\u3002If you can't speak Chinese, avoid this place. I'm serious.\n\u3002No one will give you positive feedback. They'll only give this to you when you are about to leave the company.\n\u3002No career opportunity or progression. Everything is unclear. Same, they'll only give you hope for career progression when you're about to leave.\n\u3002Worked with Shopee's China team and they laughed at my Chinese accent, kept saying they don't understand. While at the same time THEY CAN\"T SPEAK ENGLISH.\n\u3002Compensations and benefits are the worst among all tech companies. \n\nThere're more. Probably time to write an article about my unhappy career at Shopee. Anyway, if you want more money, go to ByteDance, if you want culture, just leave Singapore, if you want to be healthy, go to European companies.

No concept of boundaries. You are expected to prioritise the company above everything. Senior management openly calls for 'work-life integration' instead of work-life balance. People who cannot keep up are viewed as not a good fit for the company. It's not even a big deal when people resign anymore.\n\n3. Wasted effort with multiple departments doing duplicate work because CEO will say something and multiple teams will jump on it without clarifying. Every one rushing to make decks for the CEO instead of doing real work. \n\n4. People are paid according to their education not the amount of work they do. Someone from private uni can be doing the same or more work than a local grad and be paid much less. Senior management can also be openly condescending to those from private uni background. It gets better after a while, but starting point is very uneven. \n\n5. Lack of coaching. Management actively hires a lot of fresh grads but gets frustrated when they need time to ramp up or cannot cope with some of the work thrown at them.

Get to work on interesting projects. The projects I was given had quite high visibility so I have access to senior stakeholders. You might have a better chance at promotion if people in power know you. There are colleagues in other teams that really connect to the purpose of serving the underserved.\n\n2. Strong feedback culture . This is unheard of in other teams but my team was asked to do deep reflections and then to give each other feedback in a group setting. I find it useful even though it's time-consuming and I imagine this can be quite daunting since it's quite confrontational. However, this can help to uncover your own blind spots and weaknesses faster, and people in your team hold you accountable. It's up to you to decide if this is good or bad.", "cons": "1. Unclear direction from management . While my manager was reasonably competent, the level above her is simply not. She provided no sense of where the team should be headed and all she wants to do is to follow what other companies are doing. Be original! The team once spent a few meetings discussing an insignificant agenda with no outcome, actually she herself also doesn't know what she wants. In one of the town halls, the management even said that employees should be prepared to sacrifice in the short term i.e. work longer hours, no personal time, for long term growth.\n\nDo note that a lot of the managers are junior because this is their first job and are rewarded for their loyalty. Promotion is based on tenure. You can have about 10 years of experience and be reporting to someone with half of that. This means they have no experience leading teams or what to do. What they can add to you is probably to tell you what the CEO or this particular senior management thinks.\n\n2. Don't expect to be coddled. Especially for mid-career hires, you will be squeezed dry and quickly burn out because:\n\n-The priorities are always changing so you might need to redo everything from scratch. Specifically for my team, the HOD only believes what other people say even though she hired me to do the job. \n\n-No one will be free to talk to you. Everything here is about execution and fire fighting. If you are new, either swim or drown. \n\n-Figure out who the stakeholders you need to talk to yourself. There is NO organization chart . The reason given was that the teams are always re-organizing but we know that it's actually because of the high attrition. Employees are asked when posting on LinkedIn to censor the names and prevent tagging other employees as it gives a sense of the structure. Other tech companies are poaching actively. Even big companies have organization charts so I'm not really sure why the secrecy.\n\n3. Overall lack of transparency. Similar to the org chart point, when the recent saga online, employees only received an email addressing this about 1 week after. Until the point I left, there was no news on what the outcomes of the investigation were.

This technically means you'll have a lot of days spent working till 12AM and beyond just to make sure everything runs smoothly. If you're someone who wants to plan a life outside of work, FORGET ABOUT IT.\r\n- Like many other reviews have mentioned, the working hours are dismal, OT is the norm/expected and goes largely uncompensated. You might think that it only gets intense during big sale periods, but that is not true. You work at a back-breaking pace all year long, and management likes to assuage you that it gets better after 9.9/10.10/11.11, but that is simply not the case. The pace at which campaigns switch up and change every month leaves no respite, and most colleagues who have been here for more than 1.5 years are absolutely burnt out.\r\n- Frequent meetings scheduled at 7PM (end of work)/our TOWNHALLS are held after working hours. Need I say more?\r\n- On townhalls: during one of the presentations on Shopee's \"core values\", one of the slides presented was the core value \"I Commit\", where the slide states that exemplifying this value means employees must \"Make personal sacrifices for the organization\". On the other hand, an example given for someone who doesn't fulfill the core value is someone who \"Puts personal interests ahead of the organization\". I have no better example than this anecdote to illustrate the toxicity of working at Shopee.\r\n\r\n2. The Backend is a mess.\r\n- Product teams are expected to rush out new features to aggressively pursue growth, at the expense of quality-of-life features for employees. Therefore, what you get is a backend system that is extremely tedious and cumbersome, to the extent that some operations require you to be up at 12AM to simply push a button or edit a field, day in, day out. Completely unsustainable. When you request an update/improvement, they can only tell you that \"quality-of-life updates are in the pipeline, but are lowest priority\". \r\n- This is another example of how the C-level couldn't care less about their employees. Product teams push out features that are a complete mess on the backend and expect employees to work inefficiently to fill up the gaps. All in the name of rushing out some half-baked feature because \"our competitor is doing it too\".\r\n\r\n3. Alarming lack of diversity\r\n- Yes, the reviews are spot-on. The diversity in this company is abysmal. Working in Singapore, you will encounter entire tech teams that can only converse in Mandarin. If you don't speak their language, sitting in a meeting with them is a total nightmare.

After a good run till early 2021, upper management seems to think it's a good time to start an internal overhaul. Many teams are restructured for the \"good of the company\". but are actually politically motivated. Many people have left the company over the last couple of months and teams are overtaken by new joiners. In fact, many teams have moved to China because maybe now management is so complacent that they believe product & engineering teams are non-essential.\r\n\r\n2. Product management department leaders are inexperienced and don't understand what being a product manager really means. They don't have experience at other big tech companies as product managers and just got to where they are by being the most senior person. Majority of them don't measure metrics, don't properly roadmap, and just end up rushing whatever business requests. They aren't real product managers, they are more like implementation project managers receiving work from business and also somehow doing the work of engineers & designers e.g. ux design or technical design. Due to their inexperience and premature promotion into managers, they are also terrible at leading and don't practice servant leadership. Most of them are just focused on self-promotion, with the exception of some experienced managers.\r\n\r\nIf it was only their incompetence & lack of leadership, maybe it's not that bad. But many of them, specifically those leaders heading the Order team and now almost taken control of the entire Marketplace, engage in empire building. It's an open secret in the department that they somehow got the trust of the upper management and took control of many product teams in an almost villainous manner, unfairly weeding out previous team leads who have spent years building their own teams, and transferring their own team members to take over them. Even other product heads were weeded out or had their scopes reduced in favour of those power-hungry Order team leads. The way in which they operated led to departures of many senior product managers, leading to a very depressing morale in the product department. Many product managers around me are in interview process. \r\n\r\nDue to the highly political nature of the current product department, I strongly advise talented senior product managers to avoid this place, as you will not get true recognition here. If you are in the wrong team, you can expect to have a lot of difficulty getting recognition or getting thrown around with the restructuring. Even if you are in the \"right\" team which is in power now, you can forget about your personal growth as your manager will only be concerned with getting more power for themselves and using you as a pawn.\r\n\r\n3. Compensation here is terrible. HR will definitely low ball you.
