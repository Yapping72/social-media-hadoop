It's a norm that company will withhold last month salary until tax clearance comes out. But the date to receive remaining salary shouldn't be later than 30 days after the termination of employment, i.e. company should pay you no later than one month after last employment day even though the tax assessment hasn't been submitted or done. (what MOM told me) \r\n\r\nAfter I left company, I've sent some emails to seek advise from HRs regarding when to expect my remaining salary and when to file my tax assessment. I got ZERO reply. I didn't realize Shopee violates the law until I called out and checked details with IRAS and MOM many times, so I reported an employment act violation to MOM and forwarded the mail to HRs to ask for the status of my remaining salary. And finally they answered me and told me to wait till tax clearance came out sometime maybe in mid May (they filed my tax assessment on 8 Apr which was more than 1.5 mths after I left Shopee) That's really unacceptable! Now, I've been in touch with MOM again and hopefully they'll push Shopee to pay me ASAP. \r\n\r\nSharing my irritating experience about dealing with Shopee regarding my last mth salary is to give you a heads up when you resign.

Nothing gets worse then this. The marketing department is filled with racist, bullying colleagues who will do ANYTHING to step on you to get what they want. \r\n\r\n\u2192 There is NO such thing as work life balance here. I would work from 8 AM until 1 AM at night every single day for MONTHS. Management don't care if you burnout because they have someone else ready to replace you once you're done. Campaign period was the worst where we were staffed on weekends, and would work past midnight most days. \r\n\r\n\u2192 No job security: I would get threatened by my manager that they would fire me if I didn't do more overtime or deliver. This is a very common technique they used with other employees to scare them into working harder. \r\n\r\n\u2192 People are INCREDIBLY rude. I have never met such passive aggressive managers and colleagues. People would intentionally highlight your mistakes to the manager to step on you, and get promoted ahead of you. \r\n\r\n\u2192 Turnover is incredibly high (half our team turned over within half a year, with several others thinking to quit). \r\n\r\n\u2192 People were racist, and I would not advise working here unless if you're Singaporean Chinese/from mainland China. People were racist to me several times, and I felt limited in the opportunities that I had because of my race. \r\n\r\n\u2192 No sense of accomplishment: Everything is about MORE at Shopee. Once 9.9 campaign is over, it's time to focus on 10.10, 11.11 and 12.12. I never was once thanked or appreciated for any of my efforts, and was always forced to look ahead. \r\n\r\nSTAY away from this place if you care about your wellbeing and overall job prospects. I've seen many people who absolutely hate their job at Shopee but cannot leave because they are scared of leaving, and so they instead just try to climb upwards.

These managers have the autonomy to set their own culture within their team. \r\n\r\nIn most companies, there are bad managers but they are usually kept in check by HR from becoming too extreme. However at Shopee, HR has no oversight or visibility on what goes on within the teams, they are simply too busy with recruiting. Also, you cannot complain to HR about your manager because there is so much political BS going on, there's a chance your complaint will be traced back to you in which case your manager will show you the door. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Work life balance\r\n- E-commerce is a 24/7, 365 days business, if you\u2019re in product/ tech etc. you may be called at any time, even while you\u2019re on holiday \r\n- Not responding in group chats within ~30mins is frowned upon, they will escalate to your manager and you will get scolded. Thus you end up checking your phone every 10mins or so (over weekend, outings with friends etc) to make sure the on-going group chats do not involve you \r\n- Some managers are known to \"test\" new employees by sending them tasks on weekends to determine how long it takes for them to respond. Managers will use these stupid tests to form an opinion of how \u201chard working\u201d they are \r\n\r\n\r\n2. Micromanagement \r\n- Shopee managers are notorious for being micromanagers. I believe this culture is largely driven top down from the C-suite leaders who tend to see micromanagement positively as \"having paying attention to detail\" \r\n\r\n\r\n3. Chinese culture/ language\r\n- If you can\u2019t speak Chinese, don\u2019t bother joining. \r\n- CEO has publicly said to focus hiring on PRCs and not Singaporeans as Singaporeans tend to be \u2018lazier\u2019 i.e. complain more about work-life balance etc, which I guess is kind of true since no such thing exists in China \r\n- Taking long leave i.e. >5days is frowned upon. The attitude is \u2018you should feel grateful you have a job here\u2019. My managers complained about me to my peers behind my back while i was on leave for 8 days (I was getting married in another country) \r\n- If you\u2019re in tech, most meetings are conducted in Chinese, PRDs are in Chinese, most dev's english ability range from poor to none at all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Unprofessional team leads/ managers \r\n- Some managers even publicly scolded their team members for: leaving office on time (regardless of whether work is completed) \r\n- Feedback is never direct, it's always done behind people\u2019s back or you get scolded on the office floor in front of everyone to \u201csend a message\u201d to others \r\n\r\n\r\nTeam leads have little experience leading people \r\nTeam leads are mostly appointed by being in \u201cthe right place at the right time\u201d ~3 years ago when Shopee was a small start up, they survive by expertly managing the office politics \r\nTeam leads do not have sufficient experience to understand the complexity of your task, frankly they don\u2019t care until something is delayed or there is an issue. Then they will interrogate you until they can find something to scold you for\r\nTeam leads do not have sufficient experience to provide meaningful mentorship to their direct reports. Some leads have 10+ direct reports, they simply don't have the time either"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work at", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome culture and fun people to work with", "cons": "Non stop working but good for those who are driven"}], [{"review_title": "Okla", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Product Manager in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good package, fun and young colleagues", "cons": "Inexperienced and typical kiasu kiasi mid management"}, {"review_title": "Bad Culture and Chaotic Management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Nice office\r\n- Good stock price\r\n- Latest tech stack to work with", "cons": "- Toxic culture.

I think this is a major concern as Chinese is the main language of communication and if Shopee still hires non-Chinese speaking people to fill roles that require close working relationships with these PRCs, how can it be expected that they can perform well if they cannot even communicate well? This is extremely demoralising for non-Chinese speakers. Some PRCs do not even have sufficient English speaking skills to be able to carry out a conversation. I think it should be made clear during interviews that proficiency in Chinese is mandatory (at least be upfront about it!) and Shopee should not offer someone a job if they know that they cannot speak Chinese well. Requesting the PRCs to speak English during meetings just blatantly widens the cultural gap and as mentioned, some cannot even conduct meetings in English. This has been raised in previous reviews but I don't think anything has been done to improve the situation.
