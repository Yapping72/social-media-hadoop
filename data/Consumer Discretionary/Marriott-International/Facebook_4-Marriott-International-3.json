Those same individuals are the ones who weren't furloughed and/or eliminated. \n*Work/life balance: There is none - the expectation is those that can do get dumped on and get extra work to make up for those that are incompetent\n*Career Opportunities: Marriott has a culture of promoting within but then you have people wildly incapable of their positions which lets the entire team down\n*Compensation/Benefits: it is way below market rate (I left and got a 30k raise for same level) and annual salary increases even for SP are 2%. Bonus - not sure what that even is there as I never received one. \n*People get promoted not based on their work but based on if there happens to be an empty position - its basically waiting on someone to retire before you can get promoted. \n*Culture/Values: Terrible working culture - I have worked at many companies that had their issues too but never with such passive aggressive behavior and competing politics to accomplish a common goal of improving how a company functions. Its amazing adults can act like such children \n*Benefits: Internal employee processes and technology are so archaic. I was using a laptop that was no longer supported by the company leading projects for integration - its simple - set up your employees for success. \n*They have an attitude that just because they are the biggest they can get away with being wildly incompetent in technology, processes, benefits, and customer experience. Not everyone wants to work there - especially those who are competent and understand what its like outside the company.\n*How did they get best place to work 2021 when they laid off most of their workforce?
