They are all robots and spew the same Marriott rhetoric. The company has WAY too many layers making it virtually impossible for anyone to \"own\" an idea/concept etc - and for any decision to be made. In all honesty, their sales structure is so convoluted - once my customers found out it was going to be Marriott that was taking over Starwood, the complaints were flying. All my accounts called to voice their concern- they had existing Marriott sales representation and HATED working with Marriott. All my counterparts in the Starwood Sales Organization had a similar customer reaction. Many have vowed to never do business with Marriott again. Two problems- one, our hotel partners who did not make this decision may now unfortunately suffer and two, this company is so large they may have the luxury of doing bad business and still raking in the profit, which they have been aware of. Which is probably why they showed no consideration to long-time customers who have worked with Starwood sales for years. Starwood corporate sales offices were closed March 31, 2017 and guess what- we of course were instructed to avoid customers and answering their questions as to what was going to happen to us, through this reorganization. Left us all in a terribly unprofessional and awkward position to not acknowledge the elephant or in this case, Bill Marriott in the room. \r\nThey apparently think they can take a sales force of about ~120 Starwood sellers, and open up ~ 12 new jobs and that they have done their part to do what's best.

If you are a mediocre butt kisser or an employee  who wants to be treated like crap by management, this is the place for you.   I don't understand the high reviews and as I read through them, looks like most are at the property level.  HQ is a disaster.   You will not get anywhere by being smart motivated  and innovative.  They claim innovation is the big objective/core value but it's not.  God forbid you're smart and capable.  They will manage you out, mostly because a large percentage of managment has only gotten ahead by being there their entire career and not based on the quality, ability, or qualifications they possess, and smart capable people are therefore a threat.  There are Director level employees that would not make it outside of Marriott.   Do you really need to use a Director level headcount to specialize in creating  power point slides - as a job?  You have SVP's padding jobs by bringing in their \"buddies\" with big promotions not giving exsisting Marriott employees a chance.  When these \"buddies\" fail at their goals,  work is just shoved down to another Marriott- albeit capable- employee but giving them no time complete the work and setting them up for failure then berating them when they do.   HR is in bed with Sr. Mangement and they actively work together to ban good smart people because they are perceived as a threat to the Marriott lifers.  I have honestly not met one person who is happy working for HQ and many of these people who were lured by the sexiness of working for \"the world's largest hotel chain\" are actively looking for new positions.  Employee engagement scores are so low and get lower each year.  Yet nothing is ever done.    If the C-levels cared anything about the company they would get an outside firm to analyze all the financial waist due to poor processes, bad leadership and unethical (although probably completely legal) hiring, promotion and vendor engagement practices.   If you're smart and have any self-respect at all you will avoid this company and it's culture,  because you will not advance in your career.  You'll be frustrated while incompetent outsiders with internal connections or Marriott lifers are brought in over you because of who they know or how long they have been there and not qualifications, while you're made the scapegoat and berated when things go wrong."}, {"review_title": "Marriott is 10/10", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Oct 2017", "job_title": "Sales Coordinator in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Competitive pay, great benefits, wonderful community spirit within the company.", "cons": "There are 4000+ Marriott International hotels in the world.

No policies, no written rules, the management would arbitrarily make them up and then change them as she deemed. For example, she canceled Friends and Family day for the spa employees without previous notice or announcement, but allowed her own guests to come in free of charge. I was working that day, trust me, the back of the house was furious and complaining to me all day long, but what could I do? She was never available to help with transactions or other issues.

Anyone with common sense has already LEFT this place or is trying to leave. I was one of the ones that started from the start and I wanted to be loyal to the company and stick it out....but after i realized that they didnt care about their employees or guest  than I left to go work an an ACTUAL Marriott hotel..not another franchised hotel...and let me tell you their is a BIG difference... (Now this review ISNT about Marriott because I have worked for Marriott for many years and I LOVE working for Marriott...This review is about SSN Hotels.) They dont care about anyone but themselves...Mr. Marriott would prolly be rolling over in his grave if he knew how poorly this hotel is ran and how the empolyees and guests are treated because Marriott has such high standards for their employees and their brand...and THIS hotel is not living up to either. Its NOT up to Marriott Standards at all. If they dont get NEW management soon then Im pretty sure its gonna get shut down. Its way too many hotels in the King of Prussia area for anyone to have to stay or even WORK at this one.

If you leave, retire, get laid off or fired before Dec 31, 2018 you won't get any company match in Sept of 2019, anyone who knows anything about retirement and finances knows that you are loosing money when the match isn't automatically placed in your account at the same time that your employee contribution is. \r\n\r\nUnder staffed at the corporate IT level, they want everything done right away without proper testing of the computer systems.

Management doesn't want to deal with any issues that comes up if it doesn't benefit them in the slightest bit. Employees are taken advantage of to the point where its close to slavery. Favoritism is at work at its finest at this particular hotel, one person can do no wrong in the eyes of management where someone who had nothing to do with the situation  gets punished for the mistakes of others. The hotel is supposed to be 5 stars but their budget for items to make a hotel run smoothly is at a 2 star level. Cuts here Cuts there. I've even heard that the restaurant doesn't have their full menu everyday because it wasn't ordered for them. All in All I feel that management takes advantage of employee rolls, they take advantage of the time in negative ways, and they follow blindly as Upper management is pulling the reigns and allowing their management teams to behave like this in order to cut corners and save a few measly dollars. I wouldn't blame the Marriott Company as a whole for the behavior of their Upper Management and their crop, because when the corporate team actually comes to their annual visits they straighten right up, but then they leave and its a circus all over again. I blame their culture of where these people live and their attitudes towards human beings. Their attitude is \"If it's not about. If it doesn't make me money, If it's something I have to go out of my way for, then I don't care because its not my problem.\" The \"team\" building here is horrible, no one will assist you in tasks or give you guidance, its sink or swim.  Even if you perform to the best of abilities and give it your all, you are cut down by a back handed phrase disguised as a compliment i.e. \"You did exactly  what I asked, the exact same way I told you to do it, but you didn't do it the way I would, so now I have to do it myself.\" Never once will you get criticism in a positive manner with this management team.

The bedbugs are probably gone.", "cons": "This is absolutely a sales job; it doesn't matter that you aren't making cold calls.  You will be talking nonstop -- and I mean nonstop, I was taking well over 100 calls daily when I quit -- to customers who do not understand pricing in the hospitality industry.  A lot of in-house information (like about parking costs, this was the worst) is not kept up to date or contradicts itself. Explaining why a hotel room often has a different cost depending on the day and still making the sale is one of the easier parts of the job.  Unless you're talking with someone whose loved one is coming in for surgery and you have to explain that even though the hotel has availability, the hospital rate is sold out because Ariana Grande is in town.  \r\n\r\nYou aren't selling leggings and can openers. You are going to hear people cry because you can't help them find somewhere to stay in an emergency.  I worked here during and after Hurricane Matthew, Hurricane Harvey, and a few other natural disasters.  Some of those calls still honestly haunt me.  I was told to prepare for obscene crank callers, or the occasional person who would call in and claim they were going to end their life.  Those happen.  I was not prepared to tell a dying person that they couldn't stay with their family at a property that held a lot of sentimental value to them unless they prepaid an overinflated three night minimum because a there's a football game that weekend. \r\n\r\nThe emotional burnout was awful.  This is an absolutely terrible job if you're an empathetic or compassionate person.  I remember more than one person telling me they coped with it by just assuming everyone is lying by default. I couldn't.  I laugh at the commercials on TV now because I know how deceptive the \"we care\" brand is.  Trust me, Marriott corporate doesn't care at all.  Look online for all of the employee strikes in the last few years, and the furloughed workers due to COVID-19 who don't qualify for unemployment. \r\n\r\nI was still successful at the job, consistently exceeded sales quotas, and regularly got a monthly bonus when I worked at the Solon center. The best advice I can give a current/potential employee is that your biggest competition is online travel sites. Get in the habit of telling a guest to check their exact travel dates when they're looking at an external website.  If they're seeing $60 on Expedia compared to your $300, that is almost always why.  Also, let me tell you in advance that a doctor's note will not excuse an abscence. This job is a nightmare if you have a chronic condition and need maintenance care.  I'm now fighting an uphill battle with a disability claim because I was doing wound care in the on-site bathroom instead of going to the doctor due to the inflexible scheduling.\r\n\r\nI'd like to echo another reviewer and say the cubicles can be absolutely disgusting.  People are told not to eat but they do it anyway. I'm not kidding when I say I walked by someone eating a bucket of chicken from KFC, and overheard a coworker telling a guest to hold so she could chew her chips.  Bring disinfectant wipes.  Your cubicle will still be covered in crumbs, but they help clean up the.. rest.  There is no enforcement of company policy.  I don't understand why, but when I worked there, the only thing management was allowed to do was send a strongly worded e-mail asking people to stop eating or spraying their perfume/cologne in the closed space.  \r\n\r\nThe people were great!  The job was an absolute nightmare.  I don't even think I would recommend this job to a robot.
