She will purposely arrange colleagues who are close to her to work those easy shifts and those who aren't close to her will be assigned to work weekend shifts most of the time. Lazy boss. Will snake around during work or report to work late. There will be times I needed her help, but she's not replying my Skype msg for hours. 0 knowledge. She has 0 knowledge about our work. Whenever we needed help with our tasks, she's will nvr help and we end up needing to look for seniors from other regions to help. Imagine in the team for 3 years and we nvr had a team meeting before. I had a feeling she dont dare to organize a team meeting as we will ask her so many questions that she cant answer. No wonder she only got 3/10 for her annual review."

I've been working for this company for one year and I can contest that I am the only employee that has made it this long, which is saying a lot. I've gone through 4 GMs and 2 AGM's, I am on my 3rd. It seems like every time a new manager is hired once the hotel/restaurant is about to have some sort of structure the top management works our bosses to ground and don't offer any sort of incentive to keep them. They rather just hire a new manager and have their staff at square one. Its really disappointing."

This also contributes to an attitude from the office workers that their fellow associates are below them simply because they work in a front of house role.  It is also a major factor in creating the nasty and toxic work environment that trickles down from senior management.  People are promoted far too quickly and often left with minimal training to figure out entirely different job roles as they work. \r\n The company tried to engage in \"Fire and Re-Hire\" during Covid-19 but are still left with a skill shortage as people moved on to different industries."

I trained for a month, had a family emergency come up, and was told I would have to start my training all over again. I wouldn't have minded if I was one or two weeks in; but I was there for almost the full month and I would have to restart. But I think what made it an overall not good experience is the job wasn't worth the pay that they're giving you. Also having to work crazy hours until midnight doesn't help. If you wanted to change your hours you had to wait at least 90 days before than. On top of that having to wait 90 days before your benefits kicked in didn't help. I'm new to the state that I'm in and brought my own insurance until my job insurance came in. \n$15 an hour is nice until your bills start to add up and other employer's are hiring at a better rate. I learned this the hard way and to anyone who reads this know your worth because I'm not worth $15 and this job isn't worth it either.\n\nNot worth the stress or mental headache"

The manager kept \u201cforgetting.\u201d It was strange. I started about 6 weeks after being hired."

		"cons": "1. No Communication From Management PART A: You are expected to work EVERY holiday. No taking turns, not every other holiday, EVERY holiday The trainers claimed that this was explained upon hire. This was NOT explained upon hire. They kept repeating this lie even though EVERY associate in the hiring group agreed this was not mentioned upon hire. If you want a day off you have to compete with every single person, because the standard schedules are not honored during the holidays. The bidding for holidays is largely decided by seniority. That means they get every holiday off and you get nothing. I should at least be able to get ONE holiday off. In the first 90 days you don't even get bonus pay. How are you going to make me miss Christmas and Thanksgiving with my family and then disqualify me from holiday pay? If you don't live near your family then you have to give up on every seeing them. PART B: The first time I spoke to my manager was when I was resigning. I was there for a month and I had to repeatedly ask to get the name and email of my manager. By the time I got their name I was already ready to resign. There was no one to answer my questions. HR did not respond to my emails and my the trainers use all their time on the 5 people who need instructions on how to screw in a lightbulb. 2. Unprofessional coworkers/trainers Lots of gossip and meanspirited comments towards people not in the meeting rooms. I have NEVER reported anything to HR in my professional career. I considered doing it TWICE in the month I worked here. I mentioned the unprofessional environment as a reason for resignation. HR and management had ZERO interest in knowing what I was talking about. List of some minor and major things I witnessed. REALLLY distasteful statements made about the trainers and the workers not in the conference call. That I will not repeat because then this review would not get posted. A worker INSULTING and BERATING a coworker in a call with everyone in it. This was not interrupted or called out for being inappropriate. I would have fired this person on the spot. If I hadn't left the next day I would have reported them to HR and the trainers for allowing this person to bully their classmate. Individual talking about her sex life and how she hadn't gotten laid in 7 years in a work call with 20 people WHILE she was in office where management could hear. People chewing into microphones and not muting themselves. The trainers did not directly address this person they just made passive aggressive comments."

They don't train the staff long enough and expect so much from them-you would think that they're paying them at least $25 an hour to put up with so much! Wrong! For the measly $15 an hour they expect you to sell sell sell and dangle bonuses only to take them back due to poor productivity which is due to constant system issues. I have never in my life worked for such a horrific company. What's even worse? They just keep building new hotels on the backs of the staff members whose blood, sweat, tears and stress are in the foundations of those buildings and don't even consider paying them at least a decent pay of $20-$25 an hour. I hope that upper management reads this. This company is like a revolving door. Within the first few weeks of starting to work there at least 5 of my team members quit. Within the first few months almost the entire team is gone. One team member gave their 2 weeks notice and had to leave early due to the PTSD that comes a long with the job. And don't bother complaining to HR. They couldn't give a rats behind that you are stressed out because of THEM. They'll just hire another group and round and round it goes. Don't fall for the scam and don't stay at the hotels. You are paying for them to continue abusing their employees. So happy that I'm out of there."

This was especially evident in the pandemic, where everyone else was pitching in, GMs continued to enjoy a great deal of flexibility, no time actively participating, and time off, returning to berate employees for what wasn't done, despite the lack of human resources, cut budgets and continued high-rate of physical, personnel and client problems . I'm aware of only 2 high performing GMs, in this large market, that everyone would love to work for. It has made multiple roles that report into the typical GM undesirable to stay in, even through each of my peers that have left, wanted to stay in Marriott. There is no good way to transfer, if your time in role is not done, or if the GM won't release you, because you are his/her workhorse. Interview the GM carefully, and ask to interview the staff. Also try to get to know staff at multiple hotels, before you choose to enter Marriott. Hotel management companies that thrive on results and excellence, might be a better fit. But, you could get some experience at Marriott first, to make you attractive: so don't write off Marriott, just have it in mind to use it as a stepping stone, if you do not happen to land with a good GM. If you have a good GM, support the GM, work to create an excellent work culture and find ways to improve the guest experience, processes and atmosphere."

It seems like every time a new manager is hired once the hotel/restaurant is about to have some sort of structure the top management works our bosses to ground and don't offer any sort of incentive to keep them. They rather just hire a new manager and have their staff at square one. Its really disappointing."

This also contributes to an attitude from the office workers that their fellow associates are below them simply because they work in a front of house role.  It is also a major factor in creating the nasty and toxic work environment that trickles down from senior management.  People are promoted far too quickly and often left with minimal training to figure out entirely different job roles as they work. \r\n The company tried to engage in \"Fire and Re-Hire\" during Covid-19 but are still left with a skill shortage as people moved on to different industries."

I wouldn't have minded if I was one or two weeks in; but I was there for almost the full month and I would have to restart. But I think what made it an overall not good experience is the job wasn't worth the pay that they're giving you. Also having to work crazy hours until midnight doesn't help. If you wanted to change your hours you had to wait at least 90 days before than. On top of that having to wait 90 days before your benefits kicked in didn't help. I'm new to the state that I'm in and brought my own insurance until my job insurance came in. \n$15 an hour is nice until your bills start to add up and other employer's are hiring at a better rate. I learned this the hard way and to anyone who reads this know your worth because I'm not worth $15 and this job isn't worth it either.\n\nNot worth the stress or mental headache"

There are only a few employees left from the original group of 30 I started working with. Almost all have left within a few short months, as the job is sooooo stressful. The biggest slap in the face is that they pride themselves on continually opening new hotels, which you have to read about daily, and multi million dollar renovations, but they can\u2019t pay their employees a living wage. They have a lot to learn about doing right by their employees. They say that the employees come first, but they come last."

No taking turns, not every other holiday, EVERY holiday The trainers claimed that this was explained upon hire. This was NOT explained upon hire. They kept repeating this lie even though EVERY associate in the hiring group agreed this was not mentioned upon hire. If you want a day off you have to compete with every single person, because the standard schedules are not honored during the holidays. The bidding for holidays is largely decided by seniority. That means they get every holiday off and you get nothing. I should at least be able to get ONE holiday off. In the first 90 days you don't even get bonus pay. How are you going to make me miss Christmas and Thanksgiving with my family and then disqualify me from holiday pay? If you don't live near your family then you have to give up on every seeing them. PART B: The first time I spoke to my manager was when I was resigning. I was there for a month and I had to repeatedly ask to get the name and email of my manager. By the time I got their name I was already ready to resign. There was no one to answer my questions. HR did not respond to my emails and my the trainers use all their time on the 5 people who need instructions on how to screw in a lightbulb. 2. Unprofessional coworkers/trainers Lots of gossip and meanspirited comments towards people not in the meeting rooms. I have NEVER reported anything to HR in my professional career. I considered doing it TWICE in the month I worked here. I mentioned the unprofessional environment as a reason for resignation. HR and management had ZERO interest in knowing what I was talking about. List of some minor and major things I witnessed. REALLLY distasteful statements made about the trainers and the workers not in the conference call. That I will not repeat because then this review would not get posted. A worker INSULTING and BERATING a coworker in a call with everyone in it. This was not interrupted or called out for being inappropriate. I would have fired this person on the spot. If I hadn't left the next day I would have reported them to HR and the trainers for allowing this person to bully their classmate. Individual talking about her sex life and how she hadn't gotten laid in 7 years in a work call with 20 people WHILE she was in office where management could hear. People chewing into microphones and not muting themselves. The trainers did not directly address this person they just made passive aggressive comments."

They don't train the staff long enough and expect so much from them-you would think that they're paying them at least $25 an hour to put up with so much! Wrong! For the measly $15 an hour they expect you to sell sell sell and dangle bonuses only to take them back due to poor productivity which is due to constant system issues. I have never in my life worked for such a horrific company. What's even worse? They just keep building new hotels on the backs of the staff members whose blood, sweat, tears and stress are in the foundations of those buildings and don't even consider paying them at least a decent pay of $20-$25 an hour. I hope that upper management reads this. This company is like a revolving door. Within the first few weeks of starting to work there at least 5 of my team members quit. Within the first few months almost the entire team is gone. One team member gave their 2 weeks notice and had to leave early due to the PTSD that comes a long with the job. And don't bother complaining to HR. They couldn't give a rats behind that you are stressed out because of THEM. They'll just hire another group and round and round it goes. Don't fall for the scam and don't stay at the hotels. You are paying for them to continue abusing their employees. So happy that I'm out of there."

This was especially evident in the pandemic, where everyone else was pitching in, GMs continued to enjoy a great deal of flexibility, no time actively participating, and time off, returning to berate employees for what wasn't done, despite the lack of human resources, cut budgets and continued high-rate of physical, personnel and client problems . I'm aware of only 2 high performing GMs, in this large market, that everyone would love to work for. It has made multiple roles that report into the typical GM undesirable to stay in, even through each of my peers that have left, wanted to stay in Marriott. There is no good way to transfer, if your time in role is not done, or if the GM won't release you, because you are his/her workhorse. Interview the GM carefully, and ask to interview the staff. Also try to get to know staff at multiple hotels, before you choose to enter Marriott. Hotel management companies that thrive on results and excellence, might be a better fit. But, you could get some experience at Marriott first, to make you attractive: so don't write off Marriott, just have it in mind to use it as a stepping stone, if you do not happen to land with a good GM. If you have a good GM, support the GM, work to create an excellent work culture and find ways to improve the guest experience, processes and atmosphere."
