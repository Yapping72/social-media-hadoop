The automated Mintek system for preventive maintenance is used to give you an idea when work is needed on equipment.

It's great to get a large property on your resume to show to future employers but not to stay long term.  They fail to recognize that engineering staff are not unique to hospitality and compensate you like other hotel-specific departments.  Their own corporate philosophy says that when recruiting senior management, that they accept people from all backgrounds and thus must pay competitive with other corporations management pay scales.
