Positive feedback is the cotton candy of HR tactics; you don\u2019t have time for this. On the flip side, these drones working for you aren\u2019t going to learn their lesson unless they stop making mistakes. They need to fear making mistakes. That way, mistakes simply won\u2019t happen!\r\n\r\n2) Take credit for the work of others. Hey, you hired them. The glory is yours. Besides, your employees probably would have been embarrassed had you publicly recognized their great idea and nose-to-the-grindstone effort.\r\n\r\n3) Get your employees hyper-competing with each other. Yes, we\u2019re competing externally with a host of other talented, amazing companies. But competition begins from within, where employees duke it out in the employment octagon, leaving the most talented standing. We need to separate the wheat from the chaff; once that\u2019s done, we can start cooperating and going after our competitors.\r\n\r\n4) Ignore the great ideas of your employees. In fact, don\u2019t even listen, unless it\u2019s an idea worth stealing (see no. 2). You\u2019re the one with the fancy degrees; these people work in lower positions for a reason, right? With a limited amount of precious time each day, mete out your listening carefully.\r\n\r\n5) Keep dead weight around, but fire good people for no reason. And when it\u2019s time to cut off some heads, do it with extreme prejudice and impunity. It\u2019s best to keep your employees off-balance, sort of like a gunslinger making a poor sap dance by shooting at the ground near his feet. Keep \u2018em limber and focused!\r\n\r\n6) Haze outgoing employees. People quitting your organization are quitters. They need to feel pain for their betrayal, even if you\u2019re providing them a dangerous narrative to share via word of mouth, social media, blog posts, future speeches, and so on.\r\n\r\n7) Keep tabs on employees by stalking their social media accounts. And if you get a sniff of something you don\u2019t like, ask for their personal passwords so you can log in and get the real scoop. Oh, you need not worry. It\u2019s probably not yet illegal in your state. And they\u2019re your employees; you deserve to know what they\u2019re doing online.\r\n\r\n8) Stop even thinking about work-life balance, because it has nothing to do with work. Get a grandparent to go pick up your puking child. We hired you to be here, working for us, and we expect you here. We don\u2019t have time for sick children, nor your own sniffles. Athletes play through pain every day. Why can\u2019t you and your kids do the same?

You will become very frustrated very quickly if you have a reputable work history.   The work is archaic, backwards, and very rudimentary; you will not learn, grow, or be challenged.   You have Directors at Marriott who wouldn't even cut it as an Associate at other companies.  The caliber of work you get from a lot of Marriott HQ employees is very hit or miss (more miss).  Your experience largely depends on which dept you end up in, however the feeling of discontent is widespread across all depts.   I wouldn't even know where to start re: how to fix Marriott; it's permeated throughout the whole organization, especially post-Starwood merger.  Their chaos happens at every stage: e.g. recruiters contacting you 6 mos after you've applied and then going MIA, teams bleeding money  with nothing getting done, HR not paying out final paychecks once an employee leaves and not responding (totally illegal), them doing the merger on their own with out the gel of a consulting firm, etc.  It's a testament to what Marriott is really like.   There's no forward thinking or strategy or intelligence being applied as a whole, and you will feel it as an HQ employee. \r\n\r\nAlso, their benefits are meager in comparison to other Fortune 500 companies.  If you're an expectant mother, their mat leave is laughable.  They've been getting away with mediocre benefits based on their name and the fact there isn't much competition in the DC area, but that will likely change in the next few years if I had to guess."}, {"review_title": "Work interesting, work life balance good, pay terrible.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Dec 2008", "job_title": "Senior Analyst in Bethesda, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The location is great, the people are nice, the work life balance is fanatastic, and there are tons of opportunities to move around.", "cons": "Definitely the pay.

That's $5 per associate and family for drinks, food, and anything beyond trade-outs. Completely disappointing.

When everything surfaced, a few associates called HR, and management caught wind. Management's response was to transfer the manager to another property and call it a day. When the associates found out about this, more calls to HR and threats to quit flew around. A HR rep from Bethesda flew out and sorted it resulting in a termination of the fraternizing manager but not the associate.

Support and development tends to be equally distributed and management is usually very serious about this! An all aboard mindset is key to success.\r\n\r\n- Corporate is easy to get in contact with and provide efficient and helpful support with operations. They also have clearly outlined procedures for handling on-property issues. This is excellent, as some smaller companies have prove to be more difficult to communicate with.\r\n\r\n- Overall, this company imparted onto me two important mindsets: 1) Be thankful for initially negative guest or employee situations, they can (with much work) often be turned into the most impactful opportunities, and 2) There is always a better way of doing business for guests and your team.\r\n\r\n- This is a five-star review based on my time in Bellevue and Denver.

Over the course of three years, I found myself at three different properties. The first two were hands down amazing and positive experiences. The last one made me thankful for the first two.
