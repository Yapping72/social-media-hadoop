All that is now gone.  Most of the hotels have cut the staffing almost in half ' do more with less' is now the guiding principle of the company. The pay is about the same as most of the big chains, depending on the city you are in.  Marriott won't pay the top wages, but they will be in the top 3-4.

In today's corporate culture it is refreshing to never feel like you have to compromise the values taught by mom and dad.   The emphasis of the Marriott family on respecting the individual and treating them well so that they treat the guest well is still strong and encouraged by senior management even though the company is now publicly traded and large.  The company is very good at allowing associates to find their life/work balance.  If you are in hotel operations there is a significant chance to move from brand to brand, state to state, or even country to country.", "cons": "Depending on your job description, there may be limited room for promotion (this is more true for the \"formal\" professions).  In some departments/divisions, associate opinion surveys are seemingly ignored and the formal review process is not enforced.  Because of the tendency to avoid conflict and reach consensus, bad managers linger with little place for the associate to go for resolution.  The associate may feel as a complaint would be seen as being disloyal.  Associates generally won't take complaints up the chain of command in concern that they will be the one found to be at fault and the action will be detrimental to one's career."}, {"review_title": "Great Learning Experience but Stressful with Long Hours", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Oct 2013", "job_title": "Revenue Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Opportunities to move around the world and between departments\r\nMany employees have been with the company for decades and are extremely knowledgable\r\nTraining programs are exceptional", "cons": "All Revenue Manager's are required to work 50 hours, but really work many more than that.
