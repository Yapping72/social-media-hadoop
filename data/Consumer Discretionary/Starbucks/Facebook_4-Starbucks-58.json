We also basically get as many free drinks we want during our shift and 30 minutes before and after our shift. During our shift we also get 1 free food item. Minors also are given a half hour break when working shifts over 5 hours. Every barista is given at least 1 10 minute break during their shift. Work clothes are definitely more relaxed than a lot of places. We are allowed to wear jeans, work appropriate sneakers, a variety of tops, and even dresses or skirts! We are allowed to wear leggings too, but only under dresses or skirts. Starbucks also gives partners (that's what employees are called) lots of benefits including free online college through ASU! Another plus is great starting pay.", "cons": "We do get tips, but all tips we make within a week are split up amongst all partners, so we don't get very much. Although we do have a more relaxed dress code, there are still limitations, such as no nail polish (which is pretty normal in the food industry), we can't wear light or faded jeans, no ripped clothes, no t-shirts (unless they're polo shirts or shirts bought from coffeegear.com), tops have to be a certain color, etc. Basically, we still dress for safety and we are required to wear clothes that match our aprons. Even though we get unlimited free drinks during our shifts, we aren't allowed to drink on the floor, meaning if we want to take a drink, we have to stop what we're doing and go to the back. When working during a rush, you might not even be able to take a break to go to the back to take a drink, which is not to say we are being overworked, we just can't be constantly going to the back just to get a drink."}, {"review_title": "It was an okay job", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get free drinks every time you work", "cons": "You have to be okay with getting dirty"}, {"review_title": "Good Experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Barista in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Meeting new people, learning, great community, always aware of the situation.

I would say 60% of customers in my location were kind and understanding but the rest were awful. I have been spit at, cussed at, harassed, and even hit on/stalked a bit by customers. I got paid 11 bucks an hour and tips were split up BETWEEN EVERYONE based on hours worked. I honestly thought was not fair because people who slacked off or didn't get the tip still got it if that makes sense. My manager was horrible, scheduling was never correct and it was always the partners fault if the manager messed up on shifts. We would have a constant rotation of new people because the conditions were so bad people would just quit and walk off not even give their 2 weeks it was that bad. The district managers would come in and try to \"trick us\" to see how good we were and then they demanded all this free stuff like they owned the place. I had my district manager come in during rush hour and make us make her 2 fresh coffee travelers and pastries for her kids school meeting. We had a line out the door and she just walked in and demanded that and got mad at us when we couldn't make it fast enough and when I asked how she was going to pay (cash or card) she literally laughed at me and said \"oh honey, you must be new, I am the DM and I dont pay for these things. Haha put it on my tab hehe.\" I didn't get paid enough for the crap I put up with. I put my two weeks in and my manager came up to me on my last few shifts and literally told me I was going to work way past my cap hours and everyday and she didn't ask she just went ahead and scheduled me even when she knew I was quitting. After that I told her I wanted to quit on the spot and she got really petty with me and told me if I walked out I could never work at a Starbucks again even if it was a small one at target/grocery store. After she told me that I said I would finish out my shifts and she immediately told me I was not allowed and I should leave. So she completely disregarded what I said about finishing out my two weeks and banned me from starbucks herself. I had a few coworkers hear this conversation and they told me to report it to corporate. I did nothing was done about it. After I was basically forced to leave not even 3 weeks later every single morning shift partner but 1 quit.

We were constantly told that once the labor system caught up with our sales, we would start getting more labor and shifts wouldn't be so horrible. This kind of communication happened for all of the 7 years I worked here- things are always just about to get better, but it's always out of management's hands.\r\n-The way people are promoted is also pretty BS. At some stores, all you need to become a shift are to work full time for a year and want it. At others, people that are very well qualified can't move up no matter how hard they try. I was a shift for 6 out of my 7 years, and although I wanted to become an Assistant Store Manager, I kept getting the run around about what I should do to make it happen. My District Manager literally said he had no say over who could be promoted, that it was decided basically by how much 'positive buzz' someone could get in the district. In order to help build my 'story,' I was volun-told to help open a new store as one of their supervisors, and actually I had more experience at the company than almost everyone else there, including the manager. Turns out she disliked me (later I heard someone from another store say, 'Oh, XXX is your new manager? Well if you aren't gay she won't like you,' and I'd say that seems accurate). Instead of moving up, we eventually had a conversation where she laid out a vague ultimatum, then said we would reassess whether this job was a good fit for me. After 7 years... So I quit.\r\n-Quality of your experience varies wildly between stores. The store I was at for most of my career was well run, had a great client base, and was still very understaffed. I also worked at stores where everyday was an 'every man for himself' kind of experience, and there was no time for coaching or any kind of improvement. If you handed out a crap drink or poured 3-hr old coffee, you just crossed your self and sent them on their way.\r\n-While supervisors and baristas are getting pulverized on the floor, management spends over half their time in meetings, talking about their feelings, and working towards self-improvement. I'm not even joking. Store managers have become more and more a back-of-house only position, and when you went back there, most of the time they were in a meeting talking about their feelings. Not saying there isn't a place for that, but not when the rest of the store is drowning and can't get caught up on orders.\r\n-Although the company culture sounds good- basically it's about making people's day with small moments, making connections, working to always improve, that kinda thing- it's completely subverted by the actual experience of employees. During my fiance's last week, there were dozens of customers who she had been close to for 5 years, and yet she was too overwhelmed and busy that whole time to even tell them she had quit.\r\n-The upshot of all of this is that the company is losing a lot of it's talent and experience. I worked there for 7 years, my fiance for 6, and we both know several experienced baristas that have left within the last year because of how poorly run everything is. If you notice that quality seems to have gone down, wait times have gone up, and mobile order never seems to work any more, that's why. Stores are understaffed all the time because of their mindset of endless growth, and as a result, turnover just gets worse and worse. New baristas start, work for a few months, realize how terrible it is, and quit and get replaced. It's just not a responsible or tenable way to run a company."}, {"review_title": "Great Coworkers, But Sadly Overall Terrible Management", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "23 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Barista in Tampa, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Great people to work with overall amongst baristas and supervisors\r\n-Some good managers, though few and far between\r\n-IF you decide you really love retail, this company could potentially be a good place to gain management experience\r\n-As a resume padder, saying you worked for Starbucks can make recruiters involved in people facing professions more likely to pay attention to you (think beyond retail, this extends to many careers).

This doesn't hurt the managers of course, it all hits the frontline employee, who is left as an afterthought.\r\n-Massive logistical issues with controlling mobile orders and regulating drive-thrus, which have thrown many stores into perpetual chaos."}], [{"review_title": "Eh", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Most coworkers were great, most customers were managable", "cons": "Managers picked favorites and could quite literally let someone get away with murder all while hounding you for not being a \" team player\"\r\nhad to fight to get all my miles owed for 6 months of travel"}, {"review_title": "Boundary Buster", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Barista in Freehold, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-opportunities to improve inter-personal communication skills\r\n-opportunities to improve time management skills\r\n-opportunities to learn and understand proper osha standards and guidelines\r\n-leadership opportunities\r\n-opportunities to uphold and maintain a standard of excellence", "cons": "-poor leadership and management\r\n-unprofessional boundaries in the workplace\r\n-lack of professional boundaries in the workplace amongst colleagues\r\n-inadequate protection for employees against customer abuse\r\n-inadequate human resource access\r\n-lack of attentiveness from outside management as it pertains to employee health and wellbeing\r\n-unhealthy work culture encouraged\r\n-unreasonable expectations of employees at the lower level\r\n-inadequate compensation for employees\r\n-bullying culture encouraged by management\r\n-management bullying"}, {"review_title": "Generally bleak outlook; redeemed by positive minority", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 May 2021", "job_title": "Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get a taxi service to directly take you home if you worked until midnight.
