I worked in the same store and had three store managers in that time. \r\n\r\nThe biggest pro for me was the flexibility. You want to take a weekend off to relax? That's fine. Maybe you want to take an entire week off to go on a vacation? That's fine too. Management doesn't pry, and you don't need to give them a reason. As long as you let them know ahead of time, they're cool about it. They'll also work around anyone's school schedule.\r\n\r\nAnother pro were the hours you get every week. When you start off, you'll only get a few hours since you have to learn everything. Once you learn how to do more, you'll start getting more hours. I was always scheduled at minimum 30 hours a week, but since people called out I usually worked at least 40. If you need more hours, you could always network with other partners, shifts, and managers to work at a different store that needs someone to fill in.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of starting off, Starbucks care about teaching their partners how to do their job. I've worked in fast-food places where they put you on the cash register and just tell you \"figure it out.\" It was like throwing you to the wolves. Starbucks will assign a partner to stand next to you while you're learning to teach you and help you out in case you get stuck. They know it's hard learning so many new things at once, and want to see you succeed.\r\n\r\nLastly, you'll be given Starbucks stock. Every once in awhile, I forgot how often, you'll get more shares gifted to you. You can cash them out at any time and they're yours even after you quit.\r\n\r\nHonestly, if I could make the same amount I make now in the medical field, I would go back to Starbucks. It's a great company, and I enjoyed my time there.", "cons": "You'll sometimes get scheduled to close and then open the following morning. I've heard partners boast about sleeping in the parking lot in their cars so they wouldn't have to drive home and back. If you close and then open, you'll be lucky if you get four hours of sleep.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to become a shift, you're basically on-call 24/7.
