There is very little leadership and support- the manager is often absent or on holiday so the responsibility is left to supervisors and baristas. This naturally pushes everyone beyond their limit and creates unnecessary amounts of stress. Even when these issues are raised it does not seem like they are listened to or that management wants to hear any criticism- brushing it off as \"gossip\" and a toxic attitude of baristas which could not be further from the truth."}], [{"review_title": "Good company if store manager is competent", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "4 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Shift Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "if your store manager does their job right then your life is easy", "cons": "corporate tries to to interfere too much in day-to day without understanding some logistics and can make working difficult"}, {"review_title": "Too much work not enough money", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fast paced and interact with different people", "cons": "Have to deal with angry customers with little support from management"}, {"review_title": "Best flow", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The flow is fast paced and lots of room to move ip", "cons": "Long hours standing and can get really busy"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Barista in Milwaukee, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible, fun, training was great", "cons": "Very fast paced and can be stressful during morning rush"}, {"review_title": "Starbucks barista", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Barista-Starbucks", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supportive work environment Flexible hours", "cons": "Poor training Poor management Poor hiring practices"}, {"review_title": "Bad company that enables horrible customers", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Supervisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It\u2019s a fine job to work at while in school/gaining experience/if you need something flexible.", "cons": "The company hides behind their slightly deceiving benefits.

Employees will most likely be females in the age range of 17-25. If you are not an openly gay man, you will get discriminated against at one point or another. By discrimination I mean shift leads will be females, will shovel all the physical work onto you (morning stock and inventory, swabbing the floors, cleanplay, cleaning bathrooms), meanwhile they will just lolly gag on their phones or talk with other female /gay male employees. With the other hand I was asked to walk these ladies back to their cars to fend off homeless people that harass them. When my mother had covid and I refused to stay 3 more hours and close one night, and then I was pretty much blacklisted from promotions, or any good recommendation because this was seen as an unwritten violation somehow . I would rather leave to make sure my mom was taken care of in the hospital. After this I asked to be put on part time, my hours were then cut to 9 hours or less a week, all cleanplay and closing shifts. I watched as the people I was hired with received full hours, promotions to shift lead (earlier than was allowed), and promotion to trainer. Then I also had seen people hired after me get the same treatment, not a coincidence.

You will run into passively aggressive managers - they have trust issues both in their professional and lives outside of work. The managers use shared mailboxes to snoop into and will effortlessly move work underneath you to the vendor. You will wonder how the work moved somewhere, only to find your own manager moved it. Depending on your style, that may still be okay. You should have a strong passion and desire to work in your inducted role for long periods as they love vendor folks. However will still bring you onboard when they can't bring aboard the vendor folks. As a result, your growth opportunities may be a long haul. Accolades - you may bring appreciations and other good work for yourself back to the team. That may not be enough to move the needle. The senior folks will send note of thanks mostly to each other endlessly. Personal bias - You will be asked to do things a certain way, with no equal consistency thereof required of other team members by the same manager. You may stay on top of your work and put it to closure - only to find out rest of the team does not do so in respective tools and systems, sometimes even leaving the work open ended for years. Manager tech competency - you may wonder on this - depending on if you expected a business / tech / people manager competency of your manager. You will be lucky if your manager has atleast some of these and may be highly deficient in the areas they are responsible for. So that could be a positive or negative depending on how much engagement you though of, to add meaningful value. When the survey comes out, please fill out honestly and not sugar coat it. That does not guarantee outcomes. The organization loves longevity and you should love it as well for yourself and everyone else, to enjoy the ride. Managers circle - Do you enjoy writing notes for your manager connections ? You may have a manager that requires you to write some of these, though you have never had any touchpoint with those connections.
