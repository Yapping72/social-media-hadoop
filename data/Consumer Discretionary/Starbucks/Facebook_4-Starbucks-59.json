We deserve to make a genuine cut of the profits or at least gratuity because generally, drinks require more work than you're ever trained for. We can make a hundred custom complex drinks and still make the same rate which means our wage is worth less the more drinks we make and the more work they require.\n\nI've worked at three different stores and each store had at least 1-2 group of people that often had a leadership role but also had a very toxic personality. Having too much dependance on shift leads at the cost of employee morale.\n\nCustomers can often treat you like crap and like you're beneath them. It's Starbucks and it's expensive, so you meet a lot of snobby rich people who won't even tip. (Hence the need for profit sharing and gratuity to make employee morale better when dealing with snobby people which also incentivizes upselling and making complex drinks that cost more)\n\nOverall the worst part about this company is the facade of a caring and welcoming company but in reality only your coworkers show true care about you not the actual corporation. They give you silly benefits like a free subscription to Spotify or limit you to specific services like ASU or Lyra which sure is free college and free mental healthcare (at least the first 20 visits are) but what would actually help is giving employees a real cut of the enourmous amounts of money we make them so we can afford to choose which school we want to go too, choose our own mental healthcare providers and overall afford to live in general. This would show real care if we were ACTUAL partners who made ACTUAL cuts of the business or at least gratuity, which would incentivize workers to work harder, upsell and overall care for the business and feel cared for by the business."}, {"review_title": "Horrible", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Shift Supervisor in Ramona, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free pound of coffee each week", "cons": "Does not promote from within. \r\nFalse promises of promotion."}, {"review_title": "Barista starbucks", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits hours flexibility atmosphere culture", "cons": "Pay customers raises job tasks\r\nOpportunity for growth"}, {"review_title": "It was alright", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Learned a lot while I was there.", "cons": "Wish there was room for growth."}, {"review_title": "A Great Job Under the Right Conditions", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Barista in Rochester, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Relationship-building with customers\r\n-Great Coworkers\r\n-Free Stuff\r\n-Great Benefits\r\n-Flexible Scheduling \r\n-Great Team", "cons": "-Fast-paced high-stress environment at times\r\n-Early & Late hours"}, {"review_title": "Never again", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Shift Supervisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free drinks and food every shift\nsome baristas were cool\nbenefits were nice\npay was decent ($20 an hour for LA county supervisor)\nfree spotify", "cons": "Customers are entitled and act like you stabbed then when you say you're out of blueberry muffins\nhorrible management\nunderstaffed always\npetty management that would manipulate you into working out of your availability and if you said no, that meant less hours the new schedule\ntaken for granted."}, {"review_title": "Great culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Shift", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Really great company culture honestly", "cons": "Pay could have been better and hierarchical system was catty"}], [{"review_title": "Lots of drama", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "27 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Shift Supervisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Learning how to make coffee", "cons": "Everything else.
