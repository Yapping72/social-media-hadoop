With Covid complications we are always on call and can never truly have a work life balance. Lyra can\u2019t be used as a bandaid for a problem like this.\r\nStore Managers are living in a threat state. What boggles my mind is they asked us to prepare and set aside time for PDC\u2019s, and after those schedules are posted with development conversations, we are being instructed to cut labor and non coverage so they can meet goals for the quarter. With stores unionizing left and right isn\u2019t this the EXACT time to be making space for our partners and working through issues in our stores? What about prioritizing developing our next level leaders, especially with all the open store manager positions right now? My partners have been to hell and back during Covid and they deserve to be heard. I put my heart and soul into my store and feel no support or gratitude from corporate. I fell in love with the mission of this company, and I see efforts being made, however it often does not feel genuine or perhaps two faced.

They push us to the absolute limit in terms of numbers. I am in texas and the barista's aren't even paid a living wage here. Their wage is 10.50 and a living wage in texas is about 12$ an hour. Shift supervisors make 13$ and they work theyselves silly every day trying to troubleshoot the issues that arrise at a high-volume location.
