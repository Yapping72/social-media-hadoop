Often this involves getting in the way of others trying to make drinks or maneuver for some other position. Depending on how busy things are, this creates a mild to severe safety hazard. Same with floor mats- they are heavy and disgusting- moving them leaves a risky and unavoidable space for other workers, and scrubbing the grease off of them is quite difficult (especially for average to smaller individuals). \r\nThe lack of tips can become quite demoralizing. While nearly all other coffee shops have some form of tip prompt built into their system, Starbucks I seems to be intentionally working around tips- making it impossible to tip with cards and nearly impossible on the app. Perhaps this is compensated for in the other areas of benefit in the job, but on the surface, this can contribute to a lack of feeling valued."}, {"review_title": "Too much", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Cashier/Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice coworkers, good uniform policy", "cons": "Those drinks are wild, absolutely not"}, {"review_title": "Bad upper management", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Store Manager in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great health care plans Stock investment", "cons": "Unpaid over time Bad upper management"}, {"review_title": "nbive", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Barista in Arlington, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "it was really nice i enjoyed it", "cons": "not many cons to think about"}], [{"review_title": "Not great", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "atmosphere, customers, efficiency, benefits, hours", "cons": "pay, micromanagment, employees, criticism, annoying"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Cashier/Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good morning to you all", "cons": "Thank you for considering me"}, {"review_title": "Time consuming job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Cashier/Barista in Acworth, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible, stable wage, creative, benefits", "cons": "Time consuming, alot of work, tired"}, {"review_title": "Great job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Store Manager in Joplin, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benifits are amazing Pay is above average", "cons": "Company does change very quickly"}, {"review_title": "Great benefits", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "18 Dec 2022", "job_title": "District Manager in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits and great peers", "cons": "Micro managed To heavy in I and D.

Initially, my store seemed like a lovely place to work; great location, wonderful coworkers, and flexible schedules. However, during my last six-nine months of employment, it became very apparent that our concern was focused less on customer satisfaction and more on the bottom line. On countless occasions, I witness my store manager disrespect fellow staff as well as guests, and when addressing the behavior it was shrugged off. Additionally, there was a lot of childish behavior being exhibited during store hours such aa; crude comments and passive-aggressiveness. On many occasions, staff would talk behind other partners' backs rather than address the problem directly with a shift or supervisor. I believe this isn't just a one-store issue, but something that is more widespread than it would appear. If Starbucks truly stands for inclusion it must take a hard look in the mirror and address some fundamental hiring and operational practices.

I wasn't ever the target of any of this because I wasn't seeking advancement and only intended to stick around through school, but I was sufficiently benign that most people eventually loosened their lips around me and I realized just how toxic the whole place was and how that toxicity was structurally reinforced and incentivized from the top down.\n\nAny time workers tried to make complaints about this type of behavior, the response was always about how that kind of thing goes against Starbucks' values and culture, but when observing management (including district and corporate level), it's clear that Starbucks is a two-faced organization that absolutely does incentivize and reward that kind of behavior while claiming not to behind the veil of plausible deniability, but I saw enough to be certain.\n\nPay and benefits were mediocre-to-bad.

The shift supervisor salary (if someone is willing to tell you) is not great, maybe $2-$4 more than a barista, but they are expected to be available for 30+ hours a week (makes getting a second job to compensate for lack of pay very difficult) and the only people who can cover your shift if you are sick are other shift supervisors. Often there are only 4 at a store (depending on the size of the store) and 1-2 of those are already working the same day that you may need coverage. I have worked with shifts more than a couple of times who come to work super sick because no one can cover and they literally have the keys to the store so they have to come in.\nPromoting to store manager is ridiculously difficult and they do mostly outside hiring rather than internal promoting.

I worked for Starbucks for almost 10 years and this is across the board at different locations. Sometimes customers behave in socially unacceptable ways to get free drinks and food items or \u201cjust because\u201d, as Starbucks culture allows customers to treat the employees so very poorly due to high prices (I assume). My last manager defended us and allowed us to terminate interactions with overtly rude and nasty individuals. \r\n\r\nMy Starbucks is extremely high volume, and was very stressful due to call-outs, shortage of staff and endless tickets for drinks due ro mobile orders, Uber orders, cafe and drive-thru orders. We had a high turn overate.\r\n\r\nIn my final opinion it\u2019s a great job if you like high volume, early work hours (4am the earliest), fun coworkers, and desire good benefits for part time work (20 hours at least/week). If you are easily stressed by customer altercations, 30+ drink tickets at once, and being often short staffed - this is not the job for you. I also personally feel that the $1 over minimum wage that the company touts is not nearly enough for the pace/workload and baristas are being worked to exhaustion.
