There is no time to relax when you're there and you're expected to be full blast working and sweating and multitasking yet you will see only minimal raises once a year. Sure, you also get Spotify premium but that doesn't pay the bills. Benefits don't substitute for a living wage which Starbucks does NOT pay.\r\n-Extreme amounts of waste. You are required to fill your pastry case to the brim every single day and depending on your store, it might not even be food safe so you never serve out of it and just throw easily $100 worth of food away every single night.\r\n-Policies are very strict.... unless a customer yells and screams enough then it's ok to break them and \"make the moment right.\"\r\n-At least in my store, POC historically do not last long because of the brutal treatment they receive from customers especially compared to Caucasian workers.
