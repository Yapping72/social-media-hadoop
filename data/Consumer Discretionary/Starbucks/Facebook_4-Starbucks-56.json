Managers who have worked their way up from barista are the best and truly understand the pain of being a barista. My last manager was an outside hire and only cared about climbing the corporate latter. Very fake attitude and it hard to work with.

consistently releasing more and more complicated and time consuming beverages). very fast paced and stressful at times, and lots of hours on your feet. the company doesn't seem to like informing employees on promotions which results in understaffed and hectic promo days. dress code is a little intense for a coffee shop. pay is definitely not high enough for the level of stress and physical
