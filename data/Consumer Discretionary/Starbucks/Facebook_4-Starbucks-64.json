I had one girl who cried at her interview when I asked her why she wanted to work for Starbucks. She cried every day at work. I trained her, trained her, trained her... she cried every day. It was very disruptive to the workplace.\n\nI wasn't given enough staff on my shifts, so I had to work through my lunches and stay late off the clock.

I will give the skinny on exactly what I didn\u2019t like about the job. \r\n\r\n1. Customers are very demanding and rude. I\u2019ve worked in other coffee shops and never experienced the rude customers I did at Starbucks. Verbal abuse is pretty normal from customers. Very little is done about it. \r\n\r\n2. Pay, the pay is bad for the work you put in. You bust your butt from the second you get there to when you leave for minimum wage. Extremely stressful rushes. Not worth the money. You get tips but they are so small. Like $5 a week. They say oh you get tips but fail to mention that. \r\n\r\n3. Management has insane expectations. Like insane productivity goals and sales goals. Staff are \u201ccut\u201d even when it\u2019s busy because head office has these expectations that aren\u2019t possible on the floor. \r\n\r\nI experienced little flexibility in my life. Starbucks expected me to be available even on days I said I can\u2019t work. Hard to book time off and a huge culture against booking off time/taking breaks. Your life is expected to be Starbucks. You have to attend meetings even if you have a good reason. They are not flexible to accommodate students as much as they claim when you get hired. I got scheduled during my exams twice and got written up for \u201cskipping\u201d when I booked two months ago. Not really asking for much. I had a final exam and obviously couldn\u2019t skip it for work. That notion a student should choose between keeping their job and taking two BOOKED days off-is crazy. It was a dumb reason to be \u201ctalked to\u201d by my manager when I was always early, covered shifts and tried extremely hard. I\u2019ve had a few jobs through school and only at Starbucks did I experience conflicts with school. It isn\u2019t just my store, other friends at other stores experienced the same issues. \r\n\r\nOverall. I don\u2019t recommend it. You can make more money at easier, more flexible food service jobs. It\u2019s hard to balance school. They say school should be your priority but don\u2019t listen to your requested days off for school, while manager favourites aka full time, long term people can book off literally any day. Lots of favouritism toward full time people who\u2019ve been there years. They basically get any days off, any shifts and are always on their phones. I never saw any get talked to. Different rules exist for part time people than long term full time \u201clifers\u201d. The bias is super obvious.\r\n\r\nI also got injured and was unable to have a few days off. Despite a doctor saying I needed it, I had a note. I was guilt tripped into working with a badly sprained wrist because someone already had it booked off and they were short. I was basically told to suck it up and \u201cbe there for my team\u201d. I was made to feel like a bad employee for falling and going to the hospital. My parents were upset I was forced to work, or once again I\u2019d be written up.
