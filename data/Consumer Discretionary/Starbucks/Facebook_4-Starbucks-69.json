Places like Chipoltle and Target make $3-$4 more an hour in my state. They don't really give raises. They just bump up starting pay when minimum wage raises. I've been at the company four years, and before I got promoted I made the same as all the new people coming in. And even though I've been a shift for two years, I make the same as the shifts getting started now. So, it's just a constant line of pay, and no matter how good you are you'll always make the same as the worst person on staff. And the work is really hard. Harder than almost any retail job I've ever had and I've had some rough ones. Starbucks workers do all of the making/cleaning/stocking while being understaffed and with not even close to enough hours in the day. Starbucks has the highest cleaning standards of any food service job you've ever seen, and they are unrealistic about what goes into keeping that standard up.

Glassdoor did not have the option to select that date range, so I wanted to make that disclaimer.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThere were two main cons during my experience:\r\n\r\n1. Starbucks does provide guidelines and training materials that are consistent in all its retail stores. However, in each of the four locations I was assigned to during my tenure had interpreted the guidelines differently, and the inconsistency of management practices made it especially difficult for me to work there. There were also significant inconsistencies in how Shift Supervisors perceive the rules and protocols. This can make it difficult for Baristas because it forces them to learn how to perform the tasks according to how each Shift Supervisor wanted the tasks to be performed (examples include making drinks, cleaning expresso machines, cash till handling, marking out pastries, mopping floor mats, and cleaning bathrooms). \r\n\r\n2. I worked in 4 stores during my tenure, and it saddens me to acknowledge that in every one of those 4 locations, I experienced disability discrimination from several supervisors, assistant managers, and managers, and a few ADA violations had also occurred. In addition, I discovered after some investigation that in 3 of the 4 store locations I made to become promoted to Shift Supervisor, the management had set up requirements for me that were more complex and difficult than most of the Shift Supervisors I had spoken to. As a result, I was never able to reach that goal during my four years of tenure.\r\n\r\nThere was one attempt I made to contact Starbucks' Human Resources department to file a complaint against one of my managers. Unfortunately, that was going to involve myself being identified by the manager and I was (at the time) afraid that I would be laid off from my job if I fully came out as having a disability. As a result, I withdrew my complaint so that I could protect myself and my employment. After 4 years of exercising patience and hoping the experience as an employee at Starbucks would improve, I finally had to resign to take care of mental health issues that occurred as a result of working there. \r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nHaving said all this, I am incredibly aware that my personal experience does not represent the experiences of other past and current employees, and it is not a reflection of the company as a whole. It's important to point out there are employees with disabilities who have had an amazing and supportive experience working for Starbucks.\r\n\r\nThis is a very difficult topic for me to open up about because personal experiences are so diversified. However, I feel it is important to share so that if by chance you are reading this, you at least have the awareness that discrimination among coworkers and management (including disability discrimination) does occur and it is not just limited to one Starbucks store location.\r\n\r\nI know that for many people who work or have worked for Starbucks, it has been a positive experience. Positive experiences should be treated just as valid as negative experiences. For certain people, Starbucks is an excellent place to work. In no way do I want to discourage anyone who wants to work there. However, it is not for everyone."}, {"review_title": "Good company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Server/Waitress in North West", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary package in star bucks as of", "cons": "Non-Friendly environment in star bucks"}, {"review_title": "Good people, frustrating company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Barista in Watertown, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good coworkers, flexible schedule, decent pay for a retail job.", "cons": "Unrealistic goals from the corporate office"}, {"review_title": "Not as great as they want you to think it is", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Friendly co-workers\r\n- Open communication", "cons": "- Pay is mediocre\r\n- Hours are inflexible\r\n- Company expectations aren't any better than any other fast food place, which wouldn't be a problem but the general attitude seems to be one of, \"We're not like other companies.\""}, {"review_title": "good as a student", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Barista in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "easy hours, if you're a student.", "cons": "you may encounter crazy customers or partners"}, {"review_title": "It\u2019s fun, good benefits, hours are iffy", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Barista in Cleveland, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits are literally amazing.
