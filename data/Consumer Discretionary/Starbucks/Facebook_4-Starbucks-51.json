So if you're in a strong district, you'll likely enjoy your work more.\n\nStarbucks has a pretty robust HR department and communication ability. If an employee has a complaint, their store and district managers will usually respond so that every little detail is ironed out. If you have a problematic team member, or you are having personal issues, you can usually get the help you need.\n\nStarbucks has many opportunities for resume building. Many things like partner training, coffee tastings, store initiatives, donations, and many other programs can be framed to look really good on your resume, so take advantage of them! If there's any gap in your skills that you feel makes it hard to apply for a higher paying job, there is something you can do about it at Starbucks. You can spend 3 years there and just do what is required, or you can spend 6 months taking advantage of every opportunity and make twice what they offer. And if you love it so much, come back with more experience and get hired as a store manager or some other role in the company!", "cons": "But the food and drinks aren't always the most nutritious items, and you may find yourself gaining weight from all the carbs, sugar, and processed fats. You will also probably spend money on eating lunch at nearby restaurants and fast food, which will also affect your health and your pocketbook.\n\nIf you're in a tough area, you may find your work less enjoyable. The quality of team members will go down, and you may find that your partners don't get the proper training and ignore quality guidelines more often. Store managers may only enforce the bare minimum of standards and mostly when a district manager is coming around. This can be frustrating if you believe in serving the highest quality food and drinks.\n\nSome stores have issues with employees gaming the system. It really occurs on a case by case basis and no two situations are the same, but some employees are very good at knowing how to lodge complaints against team members and supervisors they don't like, and the company is forced to take them seriously because that's their duty. Thriving in such an environment means you must take responsibility for your own actions and not depend upon or trust that everything will be okay just because the truth is on your side. The best thing to do in a difficult store or district is make a long-term plan for how to use Starbucks to get you somewhere, and avoid conflict with problematic employees. Go with the flow, and target projects and activities to build your resume so that you can move on.\n\nTrying to move up within the company is rather difficult on average. You need that special kind of personality that everyone likes for whatever reason, and you need luck with timing to be able to take advantage of an opening. If you really like Starbucks, you might consider finding opportunities elsewhere and then coming back when you have the skills and experience to land a manager or other corporate position."}, {"review_title": "starbucks barista", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible hours, shifts went by fast, good pay", "cons": "drama between coworkers, tip share at the end of the week"}, {"review_title": "Flexible hours", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Shift Supervisor in Chattanooga, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing benefits and great hourly rate.", "cons": "Customers will try to manipulate you to get thier way or free drinks."}, {"review_title": "Starbucks", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Team Leader", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They paid well and liked that it was fast pace", "cons": "The management didn't care for my mental health"}, {"review_title": "Good part time job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Barista in Burbank, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, tips, free drinks/food, coffee experience", "cons": "Customers, expectations to socialize, opening times"}, {"review_title": "Good Experience!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Barista in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Free Coffee + One Food/shift\n-If you like coffee, it is really enjoyable learning more about different blends and seeing how drinks are made\n-Fast-paced so the shifts go by quickly", "cons": "-Can be stressful, it can depend on customers and that is not predictable"}, {"review_title": "Focused on people", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Treated well\nGood pay\nDevelopment opportunities\nGreat benefits\n40 hour work week is expected", "cons": "You will have to work some early mornings or late nights and weekends. \nOn call all the time, there are ways you could mitigate most of this though. \nFood service, so definitely not glamorous work.  \nHonestly it\u2019s not too bad."}, {"review_title": "Good for a short term solution", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "29 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Barista, Shift Supervisor in Colorado Springs, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* Good benefits for part time employees, including special/hard to find benefits like full college tuition and fertility assistance \r\n* Flexible scheduling \r\n* Free coffee \r\n* Relatively simple work", "cons": "* Work is deceptively hard on your body.
