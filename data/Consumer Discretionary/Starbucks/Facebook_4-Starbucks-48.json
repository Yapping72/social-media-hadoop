For the first time in my career I'm actually incredibly disappointed in the person I'm supposed to look to as my \"leader.\" In 10 months my DM has been in my store 4 times total while I'm expected to be there minimally 5 days per week. I know the DM is overseeing multiple stores but within a full working year I'd expect that they could make it in to see me & the team more than 4 times. Little to no growth opportunities beyond SM role. Most upper leadership positions are externally hired and then most corporate positions require you to be a DM first. It leaves you feeling unappreciated and in a dead end job as a SM. DM will promise to prioritize your development but not do anything. You have to give 150% while everyone else can give less. I haven't had a PPV in years. PDC has moved to Teams and rarely do we ever discuss my development just store performance. Never had a rewards conversation this year. The company is just different. They'll claim to be politically neutral but I think we all know the company is left leaning. If you don't align politically it can be a frustrating place to work. People constantly posting their political opinions on Workplace. Field leaders making political jokes assuming all partners are liberal. The company cares more about introducing each other with pronouns than they do ACTUAL dignity & respect. It's just an odd time to work here. Constant cuts at the bottom level. It's to be expected to protect the P&L but we are always cutting labor, running out of product, making SMs manage two stores. The list goes on and on.
