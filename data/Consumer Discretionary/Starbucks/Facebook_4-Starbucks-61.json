This is more so a gripe about customer service and less about Starbucks specifically, but I found myself having to take lots of crap from lots of people and not being able to really do a thing about it."}], [{"review_title": "Meh Minimum Wage Job, But Not the Worst", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Barista in Weymouth, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Free drinks/food 30 min before, during, and 30 min after your shift\r\n- Free Spotify premium as a benefit\r\n- 30% discount on anything w/ your partner numbers\r\n- Affiliate discounts (varies)\r\n- Paid Time Off (PTO)\r\n- Parental leave\r\n- Discounted company stock\r\n- Weekly bag of coffee beans/tea markout (free)\r\n- Good if you need a job right now\r\n- Some stores, depending on management, will allow u to use your partner free drink/food, even if you don't work at that particular store (they're not supposed to)\r\n- They have healthcare if you need it but you need to work so many hours within 3 months to be eligible\r\n- They have a 401(k) plan w/ company match called \r\n- They have the free undergraduate degree program though Arizona State University, which can be extended to a family member if you're a veteran\r\n- If you don't want to switch careers, it is very possible to go from barista -> certified barista trainer -> shift supervisor/manager -> store manager.\r\n- This certainly isn't worst job you could have, but it definitely won't be the best either.", "cons": "- Minimum wage\r\n- Very high turnover\r\n- People call out all the time and you will most likely be doing a lot more work than you should every shift (this is not the company's/management's fault though)\r\n- Customers can be downright abusive sometimes, but don't expect management to do anything about it even if they see it.

And the managers can get away with this because corporate simply doesn\u2019t care so as long as they get money. \n- The training and treatment for newer barista SUCKS, because of a combinations of trainers and managers not wanting to do their jobs to teach new baristas on how to make drinks mixed in with both managers and trainers berating then for not knowing HOW to make drinks, which makes newer employees both not know or WANT to learn how to make drinks properly. \n- The pay isn\u2019t worth dealing with the amount of mentally and physically stress that employees (and personally me) would have to go through everyday, due to the fact that Starbucks literally creates an environment that customers can treat the employees however they want because of how the company will refuse to defend their employees from any forms of harassment.\n- Lack of good management that can handle criticism nor is willing to try to make a work place environment better. Most Starbucks stores I\u2019ve worked at have this \u201cit\u2019s my way or the highway\u201d mentality where both DM, SM, or even some SSV refuse to accept valid criticism, and will degrade employees for making suggestions to improve the workplace.\n- Not to mention the contradictory goals that corporate would force employees to try to achieve. Not, we can\u2019t have fast order time AND do customer connections at the same time. It\u2019s impossible. \n- Finally, just the absolute cult-like mindset that some Starbucks employees (especially management) has. Yes, Starbucks offers better benefits than most companies, but it\u2019s not the GREATEST company ever and people who can see problems shouldn\u2019t be bullied into not pointing them out just because they don\u2019t want to accept that Starbucks is anything less than \u201cperfect.\u201d"}, {"review_title": "Good Place to Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "27 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Lebanon, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fun fast paced environment, room to grow, ability to learn new skills, flexible hours, good benefits.", "cons": "Low pay for the work you do, most stores require weekend availability, rude customers, soemtimes the training isn't great."}, {"review_title": "Overused", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "27 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Barista, Server, Hostess, and Cook", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fast pace \r\nCoffee discounts\r\nFood discounts", "cons": "Once they find you are good at making drinks they will never let your work cash register again.

Partners are forced to please customers to the point where there is a lot of room for mistreatment. I don't know a single employee who has not been pushed to the point of pretty heavy mental exhaustion. I've cried and seen many people cry at work due to the stress of the environment. Managers are prone to favoritism. For example, I am an adult who pays rent and has pretty high expenses and I get less hours than 16 year olds who have very few personal expenses, due to favoritism. I am losing my healthcare shortly because I lessened my hours at work a while back due to the temporary worsening condition of my illness. So... losing the healthcare that I heavily rely on to prevent myself from extreme pain and possible organ failure... because I needed to lessen my hours to help my body heal from a temporary worsening of my condition. Upper management (district and above) has no clue what it's like to work in the environment that they have so much control over. They push workers harder than should be possible and they make major changes that are a massive pain to all workers below them. This is a very taxing job and it's not as easy as it looks. It takes a lot of focus, hard work, and mental energy. I feel that Starbucks is on its way out unless upper management makes some major adjustments for the better of its employees."}, {"review_title": "Best job I\u2019ve had", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Barista in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great to employers and offer great benefits.", "cons": "Bad Human Resources from personal experience"}, {"review_title": "BEs t place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Dec 2021", "job_title": "MBBS Student in Ludhiana", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good place to work if you need part time", "cons": "Work time is not fixed"}, {"review_title": "Barista", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible shift options to work around school", "cons": "Serious drama which made for an unpleasant workplace environment"}, {"review_title": "Starbucks- Barista", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Barista in Dickson City, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits for part time employees, Spotify for free, accumulate sick days really easily.", "cons": "Not much room for growth unless you plan to move away"}, {"review_title": "salary", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Barista in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good co-workers and a fun place to make and have friends", "cons": "management wasn't always understanding. they didn't care for you so much.m"}, {"review_title": "bad", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Barista in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "unlimited on shift drinks and customizations- much needed after they give you 12hr shifts opening at eye watering hours.", "cons": "constantly understaffed, no staff meals, managers obsessed with sales with 0 human empathy, a fake trans friendly campaign with no real world regard for trans and staff or customers"}, {"review_title": "Be Mentally Prepared", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Supervisor in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Control over the shift, great if you're a well organized and adaptable person", "cons": "Responsible for defusing disruptions including aggressive customers, homeless people, deterring thieves.
