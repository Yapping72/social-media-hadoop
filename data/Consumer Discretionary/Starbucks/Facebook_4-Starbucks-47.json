Be ready to be compared to other stores and be told that you should do xyz because the other store they go to also does xyz. Maybe our store is just neglected, but our equipment is so old and breaking down on an almost daily basis. It adds so much unnecessary stress and is what made me step down from being a supervisor. I'm talking sticker machines (so we never know who ordered what), display fridge (having to move out all food to back fridges so it doesn't spoil is never fun), both coffee machines, water filtration system, all of it. Maintenance is useless a lot of the time and there are long wait times despite priority ranking system. We are asked to cut labour despite us already struggling as we are, and our store being particularly difficult due to high volume of Uber/Deliveroo/Just Eat orders and similar ratio of food to drinks per order, and it makes working there so stressful. You can be asked to cover shifts in nearby stores which nobody ever likes doing. We rarely get any positive feedback from higher-ups, only criticism, which is incredibly demoralising. There are often shortages of everything, and there's insufficient planning for promos in terms of stock.

They purposefully understaff these stores to \"cut down on labor costs\" except its impacting the customers in the worst way. A 45 minute wait for drinks is absolutely ridiculous, and the customers that yell at you about it are actually right for once. With our current scheduling, only one person can be on espresso bar handling Cafe orders, mobile orders, delivery orders, drive through orders.... The store managers will put you in awful positions, they don't schedule who you need to run a good shift. They don't allow enough time to clean stores (how are we supposed to close an entire cafe in 30 minutes??), which leads to SO many things being left dirty, which is so wrong to me. They value money WAY more than the \"customer experience\" that they preach so hard. Oh and it's not that people don't WANT to work. My whole store is begging for more hours, many including me have open availability. I asked for 40 hrs upon hiring, no one said anything to me when I mentioned this.
