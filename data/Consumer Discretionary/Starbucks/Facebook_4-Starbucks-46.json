Quarterly performance bonuses are given if the store performs. Medical, maternity leave, etc. & their related benefits are applicable even for part-timers. Since I left, SBUX implemented flexi work positions, even for store level positions. Partners enjoy discounted prices on food, beverages & merchandise. Partners get to take home a bag of coffee or Tazo tea monthly. Oh! and you will never go hungry or thirsty at work. Did I miss anything out?\r\n3) Workplace -  Work environment can be pretty vibrant, especially in a mid- or high volume store. From my personal experience, SBUX culture & values are strong - all partners in any store I've worked at, regardless of position, have placed efforts to truly make it the second home. Have made many longtime friends there.\r\n4) Career Progression - L & D department exists for a reason: all new hires will undergo training to equip them with all the relevant skills. And SBUX is more than happy to promote internally. Make your intentions known, do consistently well daily & for annual performance review, and you're on your way. And if you don't have the relevant qualifications, they'll send you on your way to obtaining it. Kindly note T & C applies.\r\n5) Senior Management & Support Centre - Who does what is clearly defined, so I had no trouble seeking assistance when needed.", "cons": "1) Operations - It's a nuthouse - said it before. SBUX has loads of SOPs, operations-wise. Be prepared to follow through with them and and record the books constantly. The crowd can and will be overwhelming at times, especially during peak hours. SBUX work culture is very DIY, so do expect bussing, dishwashing, store cleaning, restroom cleaning (for some stores) etc. as part of the jobscope. Yup! You clean your own store. This extends to equipment maintenance as well.\r\n2) Benefits - Value of RSU is pegged to the current SBUX stock price, which fluctuates, not good when stocks are down. Partners will need to follow the stock market and exercise much patience if they want to make the most out of their RSUs. #exercisepatience\r\n3) Workplace - You do get the nasty customers. I especially dislike the freeloader types - they can scream at your face and abuse the \"Just Say Yes\" policy. I faced too many for too long that i became unfazed by such treatment and learnt to work around such situations. #exercisepatience."}, {"review_title": "The best part time job for students", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Part Time Barista in Jurong West New Town,", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "fun working environment with good partners. \r\nopportunities to take part in barista competition.\r\nopportunities to become supervisor if you want to rank up.\r\n30% off staff discount for food, drink and merchandise.", "cons": "Can be messy at the busy peek but that is the nature of the F and B.

I was offered Starbucks stock after my first year, as well as 401k through Fidelity, and a superb Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance plan. You can cover your whole family with that plan, and it can include domestic partners. I got a pound of free coffee every week and free coffee all day (although I think that was specific to my store, which bent the rules). There's also an Employee Assistance Hotline which you can call if you're having issues in your personal life. And HR is really responsive--they won't see you as a troublemaker if you're legitimately having an issue. They will handle it.\r\n\r\nAlso, sexual orientation and gender identity are included in their anti-discrimination policy. None of the gay or lesbian people on my staff got crap for it, even though about half the staff was quietly conservative Christian and Republican.\r\n\r\nIf you're a people person, you develop relationships with the regulars and it's fun to make their day. I felt it was pretty rewarding to make drinks. I loved the artistic side of it. And again, the free coffee...just awesome. \r\n\r\nThey're also usually pretty flexible about scheduling, so it's ideal for if you're working two jobs or are a student. I worked with people in their 50's who had their own careers, but worked part-time at Starbucks for the health insurance. \r\n\r\nThe vacation time system is also pretty sweet. I worked with a guy who was there for 10 years and took like a month vacation to his home country.  \r\n\r\nThe staffs can be really tight...or they can be really vicious. But a spirit of teamwork is definitely encouraged. And exemplary work is recognized.\r\n\r\nIn an 8-hour shift you get three breaks: one 30-minute clock-out lunch, and two 10-minute on the clock breaks.\r\n\r\nYou'll also occasionally get those amazing customers and you live for seeing them. We had four customers who every year each put 100 bucks in our tip jar around Christmas. Sometimes those people can make your day with the things they say and do.", "cons": "If you work at a store worth their salt they will work you to the bone. Especially in a large or high-volume store there is so much to do, so much to clean. A morning shift person will have the absolutely insanity of a morning rush, but an evening person should be expected to handle evening rushes with a limited staff as WELL as get the place spotless in what I believe is not a reasonable time. We could get the place clean by 10:45, all right--if we broke the health and corporate rules about when to tear things down. And of course if that was ever found out we were in deep. And if we went over 10:45 we were also in trouble. Management sometimes has some very unrealistic ideas about what the job actually entails and what rules and boundaries should go with that.\r\n\r\nThe pay in my state starts near minimum wage. The ceiling for a barista is $10/hr, which you hit when you've been there about five years. But tips help, and some high-volume affluent stores will have tips up to $4/hr.\r\n\r\nThere's also a tendency to have fanatical management. Other \"kindly\" corporations like Whole Foods have this too--the managers drink the Kool-Aid and worship the company. I once spoke with my manager because my schedule was being changed with less than 24 hours notice, and that was against state law. She got this crazed look in her eye and spat \"Starbucks law goes above state law!\" But that's only a tendency. There are some pretty cool managers out there. Mine was insane.\r\n\r\nThe customers are spoiled rotten so they also get kind of unreasonable about their Starbucks. They will stand there and demand that you make a drink five times because there's still foam on that latte and they said NO foam, not LIGHT foam. This is a business model of Starbucks': everyone is special, and we will bend the rules for everybody. And I've had people scream at me and call me a (b) and promise me that they would make me lose my job. I've also had stuff thrown at me. But, that's also just customer service.\r\n\r\nThese last few years Starbucks has been obsessed with selling, too. There's a lot of pressure on the staff to make sure people go home with $15 bags of coffee and sub-par espresso machines. It's hard to maintain the relationships they want us to maintain while trying to sell stuff.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you can put up with the customers and the physical demand, and if benefits are more important than income, do it. It's rewarding in its own way.

Speed of service has started to be prioritized over quality of service which puts more stress on partners and lowers the quality of service in the end.

Starbucks tries to market itself as a \"career job\" and honestly, its starting to show (granted, there is a roof and that's a store manager position). Still, this is something that I can only in good consciousness say if you are able to put up with constant people contact for over a decade. It's not exactly introvert-friendly. For most partners, this is a good place to pause and rake in dough while we work through college or new parenthood. Its nice to meet partners and see what their ambitions are, even if very few of them are related to Starbucks. We rarely encounter Karens. The only frequently frustrated customers are frustrated for good reason. (See the cons). The people that come to our store are so friendly. We love our regulars, and we LOVE pets. Hours are very flexible, pay is surprisingly high, there are annual increases, and the tips (usually $1 a hour) skyrocket during Christmas season. Specific holidays (i.e. Juneteenth, 4th of July, Halloween, Christmas, NYD) have the tips isolated specifically to partners that work that day, and partners are paid time-and-a-half.", "cons": "There is so much pressure and too little support when it comes to drive thru stores. The worse our drive times are, the less coverage we are allowed to schedule, which leads us to be understaffed and struggle to keep up with the demand. Its a harmful positive feedback loop that ends up breaking the backs of our shift supervisors, who get in trouble for bad drive times when they have only 4 people (including themselves) to run a store with. (And corporate is back-breakingly stubborn about turning off mobile orders if we need them off.) We are also constantly given our nearby store's new hires to train since they burn through partners, and it's putting a strain on us. We've had interim managers for seven months since the manager who opened the store was forced into medical leave and then eventually got into such a tangle with the regional manager when he tried to come back that he gave up. 0 support from regional manager. My store in particular is a unionized store. The last pro-union partner left five months ago. We haven't had a union rep in 9 months. Nobody wants this here, but nobody knows or is interested enough to undo it."}, {"review_title": "Overall, would recommend", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Barista in Chandler, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My manager is great at what she does and fair when it comes to scheduling hours.
