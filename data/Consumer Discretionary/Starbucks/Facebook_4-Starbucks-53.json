It does not compare to similar competitors that rack in high tips through credit cards. Employee moral is chronically low as the job is high stress, and the turn over is the worst at any job I\u2019ve had. I have worked at my location for a year, and I have had four store managers and the staff has replaced itself twice. Corporate does not care if there are problems in the store unless it affects their bottom line. There always aspects of the store broken, from black specs coming out of the tap, to nitro being down, and having poorly functioning sinks. Unfortunately, as supply chains face disruptions, partners are on the front lines dealing with costumers who will berate you for being out of something beyond your control. High turn over and awful training compounds bad customer interactions because many baristas make drinks different ways. It is said in my location, and I'm sure more, \u201cif they don't complain, it's correct.\u201d I have faced uncomfortable comments for taking too many bathroom breaks, spending too much time in the bathroom and heard conversations sparked by management about cracking down on vaping in the bathroom. I don't even vape. But if I spend too long using the bathroom I will find my or a partners name in the store group chat asking where we are. It's appalling and embarrassing. For a several month period I face sexual harrasment from shift manager. It took nearly six months for him to be fired and I lost hours over it because we share a similar availability. Starbucks preaches about inclusion but we still have to serve homophobic customers. One would use a slur, and not hand a gay barista money because he didn't want to touch him. We only had to stop serving him once he was caught passing counterfeit money. If you care about the environment, you should know Starbucks is the most egregious offender of any company I have worked for. The extreme amount of plastic and waste that we run through is absolutely horrifying, but do not worry, they now have compostable straws.
