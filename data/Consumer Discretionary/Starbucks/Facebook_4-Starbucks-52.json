Why do you think employees are unionizing across the company\r\n\r\nTechnology: Atrocious technology for years. They rolled out automated ordering for stores this fall and it took months for the damage to slow down. Stores across the country were getting double the inventory they could fit every day for weeks, or nothing at all. They instructed the teams to trust the system and it would catch up when the impact in stores was disastrous. That's just one example of their incessant poor innovation. \r\n\r\nCultish: this doesn't get said enough about the company. There is a massive groupthink problem among store managers. You are sort of indoctrinated by lots of what amounts to company propaganda to always have faith in their demonstrably crappy systems and initiatives which are always misguided if not straight-up detrimental. No one provides actual feedback to district managers because they've learned it's not what we do. As I mentioned, many DMs are not hyper competent managers who can lead and teach others, but people who can speak to the corporate philosophy and logic.\r\n\r\nDisorganized: the Starbucks homepage is unsearchable and has lots of redundant links and navigation\r\n\r\nOvercomplicated: Store managers are given useless data dumps, busy work and meetings that prevent them from actually being useful in their stores. They have a foot in corporate and a foot in store operations and NEWSFLASH! it's coffees, teas and frozen food warmed up, NOT super complicated. But it has to be overly complicated at Starbucks."}], [{"review_title": "Stressful", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits only needing 20 hrs/week to get them", "cons": "Stressful, bad management, no care for employees by store management or corporate"}, {"review_title": "great workplace", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Barista in Glasgow, Scotland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "co workers\r\npay\r\nnot a lot of hard tasks\r\nlaid back management\r\ngood career progression", "cons": "too far for me to travel"}, {"review_title": "Job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Benefits and flexible schedule", "cons": "Remember to think about the partners as well"}, {"review_title": "Starbucks", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Team Member in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stays busy.

While obvious, this is a pro for those people who maybe want to be a bartender or remain a barista in the future! It gets you used to the fast paced environment you're bound to work in at any barista job, and it's actually really fun once you get the hang of it!\r\n- Forming long lasting friendships with your coworkers. Some of the people I met at Starbucks are still incredibly important in my life even after I left; working with people who make you laugh and help you when you're down is really important at a stressful job such as this one\r\n- Clean Plays! Every month or so, your store will have a night where a few workers will stay after the store has closed and do a deep clean of the store. Count yourself lucky if you get to be involved; it's like getting paid to have fun and clean with your coworkers without having to worry about a line of people outside\r\n- Free drinks! You usually can get free drinks during your shifts, AND a free food item for your lunch\r\n- Breaks. For an 8 or 7 hour shift, you get two paid 10 minute breaks and 1 unpaid 30 minute break", "cons": "- Consistently un-clean environment. Due to the large amount of liquids used behind the bar throughout the day, the floors (even if there are mats) are absolutely soaked. Even if you have completely nonslip shoes, you are bound to slip. In addition to such, the counters get messy very rapidly and become impossible to clean during most days from 9am-5pm due to the consistent rush of customers which not only makes it incredibly difficult to work, it also starts to smell and is generally very gross.\r\n- VERY rude customers. You should expect the rudest of the rude at Starbucks. People are not going there thinking \"I'm gonna get a quick drink or two and be on my way\", they are thinking \"I am here for my coffee fast because this is a large coffee chain MEANT for quick coffee\". As a result, customers tend to become completely infuriated when the line takes longer than 10 minutes because they are expecting consistently quick service; what they don't realize is everyone else in line is expecting the same, and due to the popularity of the company there are always lots of customers in line, and theres only so fast your team can produce food and drinks. I've had countless nightmarish experiences with unpleasant customers, but again having fun coworkers makes all the difference. If someone screams at you, you can fall back on your fellow coworkers to lift you back up.\r\n- Constant rush. As I explained in the previous bullet, pretty much every day (but especially on weekends) there is a consistent rush from roughly 8 or 9am to about 5pm. During this time, if you're on bar, you better PRAY you're paired with someone else who can bust out drinks fast; if not, you're going to have lots of angry customers and the situation will become extremely overwhelming VERY quickly\r\n- Company Policies not Upheld. This may not be at every Starbucks, but at the one I worked at many of the company policies we all learned about at the start of our jobs were not upheld at all. I had been put down by my manager one time for calling out with a headache so severe I couldn't see three feet ahead of me, and this happened to most of my other coworkers as well. Sexual harassment allegations were disturbingly high; it became a big problem because lots of the harassment of myself and my coworkers came from a higher up such as a shift manager, so we would be afraid to say anything for fear of either losing our jobs, getting our hours cut, or said harasser giving us positions at work we didn't like just to spite us. Again, I'm sure this isn't every Starbucks, but i have heard from more than one Starbucks other than mine that had similar things go on."}, {"review_title": "okay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "free coffee on the shifts", "cons": "hard work not enough money"}, {"review_title": "Good if you want to sell your Soul and hate consistent hours, sucks for consistency", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "15 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Shift Supervisor in Evanston, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A good SM can make this job great", "cons": "9/10 store managers are terrible"}, {"review_title": "It\u2019s fine here", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free coffee\nGreat employees\nEasy transferring locations", "cons": "It\u2019s a lot of work, very consistent and mentally wearing.\nPeople are a total hit or miss\nSmall work space so lots of drama"}, {"review_title": "a", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Barista in Costa Mesa, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-good partner benefits\n-good first job", "cons": "-understaffed \n-micro management\n-rude customers"}, {"review_title": "Ugh", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good people to work with", "cons": "poor management \nstressful\nfrustrating \nunderstaffed"}, {"review_title": "It\u2019s great.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Barista", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It\u2019s a great place to work.", "cons": "I have no cons about this place."}, {"review_title": "Great start to management", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Store Manager in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free coffee and a great team environment", "cons": "early mornings long hour shift"}], [{"review_title": "Beware of Benefits and Burn Out", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Barista, Shift Supervisor in Baton Rouge, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free tuition assistance of up $5250 annually, free food mark outs (up to seven items per week), free coffee and drinks (flexible on what kind), 30% discount on days off, 20 free sessions of therapy outside of health insurance", "cons": "Flexible scheduling ends at the barista level, the staff has a high turnover rate which means having a new staff all the time (it's just the nature of Starbucks, doesn't matter what location) constantly having call outs and being short-staffed, Starbucks requires being on your feet all day and being fast, there is never a slow time, staff is expected to adhere to a ridiculous color palette for dress code"}, {"review_title": "Tough job but fun", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Barista in Columbus, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Decent Pay\n- Flexible hours for scheduling", "cons": "- Customizations get tough to work around \n- Management sometimes doesn't know what they are doing"}, {"review_title": "High expectations, low pay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "10 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Shift Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits (401k, stock plan, health insurance)\nGenerally positive work environment", "cons": "Shift manager at Starbucks is essentially an Assistant Manager anywhere else.

Personal experience-wise, some (not all) people who I have worked with can be very rude with not only how they talk to you but how they show their actions. Company-wise, I can say that Starbucks is a company that is solely based on customer connections and making the moment right every time even if it means getting yelled at by customers or treated like a dog by them. I have been cursed out many times by customers when I try to make the moment right and it always blows up in my face. Starbucks gives customers the upper hand even if they are right or wrong in the situation and the employees can get bad repercussions from it.
