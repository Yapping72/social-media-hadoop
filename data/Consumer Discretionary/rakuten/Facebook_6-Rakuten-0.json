Business still works in only Japanese and even in engineering more than half the documents and meetings are in Japanese. New Japanese documents are still created every day despite official company policy that says work is to be done in English.\r\n\r\nDespite that many non-Japanese speakers came in expecting to be able to use English at work, which does not pan-out as expected. Some meetings end up taking double the time because somebody have to translate everything to the other language. Either that, or one side gets completely left-out when one language dominates.\r\n\r\nOn the flip-side, good Japanese engineers who can't speak English either quit/don't get hired or hired as a part-time/contract staff to circumvent the policy, which defeats the purpose of the policy and seems unfair to the Japanese staff.\r\n\r\nPerformance review is done purely top-down, with superiors giving performance evaluation to their members purely based on what the member claims they have done and what the manager sees (which is not much, especially if the team is big and a non-technical manager is reviewing technical members). There's no way to feedback regarding your own superior, causing no outlet to feedback on management practices that can be improved. 360 feedback was proposed but was repeatedly rejected and ignored. Recently some managers try to introduce nomination-based peer-review but not all managers are onboard with even this.\r\n\r\nFeedback regarding different aspects of the company are sometimes solicited but the response then disappears to thin-air, with the topic never to be heard of again.\r\n\r\nCEO likes to say that Rakuten is a \"tech-company\" but actually does not care about technology. Rakuten's own research department finds it very hard to do actual technical research with a longer time horizon because CEO insists on only doing project with short-term business impact (more profit or cost cutting). More focus on churning out services as fast as possible even if backed with fragile aging technology-hack, which causes problem in the long run.\r\n\r\nThis attitude permeates down the command chain, with middle-managers refusing to learn and update tech as long as the current web of systems somehow barely works. \"We don't know X so we don't want to consider doing X\" is an actual excuse used to not do something.\r\n\r\nTeams are highly protective of their own systems, refusing collaboration from other teams (\"don't touch my things\" attitude), making team work very very difficult. Teams push responsibilities to each other and would rather sit on what they have instead of working together to solve a common problem.\r\n\r\nTechnical design is just not done. Multiple copies of systems with very similar or even identical capabilities can be developed at the same time (partly due to the mentality above) and overall system architecture is not considered. Attempts to simplify/merge systems is met with resistance from teams refusing to let go of their own thing and work together with other teams. Renewal of old systems are done without thinking why the renewal was needed in the first place and just end up being a reimplementation of the old system on a different programming language or framework version, which defeats the purpose of the renewal efforts.\r\n\r\nGenerally, not recommended for engineers who'd like to work on latest technology and challenge novel problems, unless you have the perseverance of breaking through all the inertia walls first and doing catch-up by building all the required infrastructure from scratch. There are a small group of people who are working on this, but there's still a mountain of things to do yet."}, {"review_title": "A great place for stable income", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Jan 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Relaxed atmosphere\r\n- No work pressure \r\n- Guaranteed paychecks \r\n- Kudos to the HR team.

Rather than effectively fusing the Japanese work ethic with western business efficiency, Rakuten often does the inverse. For instance, engineers responsible for user-facing software can expect mountains of paperwork and politicking to push through even a minor release. Some departments, for instance, require executive approval for any change to production whatsoever. Because it is so difficult to affect change, a miasma of lethargy lingers in most departments.\n\nRakuten is not a goal oriented environment. You won't be judged on your output at this company. Rather, you will be judged based on attendance, punctuality, and appearances; and your salary will be adjusted accordingly. Rakuten uses electronic gates and other devices to track attendance. As an engineer, you are a mere galley slave of the executive leadership -- you wanted to live in Japan, and this is the price of admittance. \n\nOn the topic of attendance, Rakuten has taken the lead on return-to-office policies among tech companies in Japan. Rakuten began this process in March 2021, and currently requires all engineers to work from the office 4-5 days per week. Employee consensus was overwhelmingly opposed to this change, but their opinions were not solicited. Efforts by the employees themselves to gauge sentiment via surveys and the like were forcefully shut down by HR. The unwelcome return-to-office mandate has pushed annual turnover to record levels in many departments. Anecdotally, turnover in my department this year has been the highest I've observed in my career to date.\n\nRakuten's Q2 results were dismal, and as such, bonuses and compensation have been reduced. The CEO has made a series of ill-informed \"investments\" that have negatively impacted the company's bottom line. Rakuten's burn rate resembles that of a startup, yet its revenue growth is like that of a sluggish megacap utility company. Furthermore, Rakuten has squandered the generational opportunity of the pandemic to grow its e-commerce division's market share vis-a-vis Amazon."}], [{"review_title": "good work and life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good work and life balance", "cons": "lack of challenge \r\nno clear career path for pdm"}, {"review_title": "Okay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Designer in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "free cafeteria lunch breakfast dinner", "cons": "office politics, management style, gears"}, {"review_title": "It is retired place supporting family relationships", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Software Developer in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Highly sophisticated leadership..they are always right..and has great perception management skills.\r\nHard working collegues in Japan...whose dedication inspires you to work 24*7.\r\n3 times Free food", "cons": "Difficult promotions, only very tenured, loyal....people who are entitled with other big names in their resume get promoted."}, {"review_title": "Pros and Cons for Fresh Graduate", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Release Manager in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Big salary for a fresh graduate\r\nFree lunch everyday\r\nMulticultural and English is the main language", "cons": "Bad training for fresh graduates\r\nRoles and the jobs are different\r\nNo strict working hours as the team is spread in India, Singapore, and other countries"}, {"review_title": "It is a good company to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "31 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Senior Engineer in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a big company with a good reputation.\r\nVery systematic organization\r\nWorking with a lot of different engineers across nations\r\nLiving in Tokyo in Japan", "cons": "The salary was not compatible compare to competitors."}, {"review_title": "Global company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Administrative in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "English is common language used within the company", "cons": "Getting \"approval\" from your managers can be a bit of hustle as your manager can be away for business trips all the time"}, {"review_title": "All that glitter ain't gold", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Applications Engineer in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great office building\r\nFree and nutritional meals\r\nA lot of amenities in the office that really sweetens the stay\r\nEnglish speaking Japanese company in Japan, rarity", "cons": "Management is only interested in pleasing the bosses\r\nBosses only pleased in making the leaders happy\r\nLeaders only want to make money no matter what\r\nThis in turn creates a sick cycle of pushing down pressure down to the \"code monkeys\" leaving them in a highly tense and unhappy environment\r\nWith the Japanese management, transitioning to agile methodologies is such a climb.

The HRs are busy in politics too and the worst ever seen elsewhere. They're just tarnishing Rakutens image in India. The Bangalore office and the senior management is really bad. Theyf make you work on weekends and the credits will be taken away by the managers. They'll showcase your work to the seniors in Japan and will continue doing nothing.

And he is mostly focused on the MNO initiative. So all other businesses are basically cash cows.\r\n\r\nCompensation is more or less decided upon your entry to the company. Raises are good only if you are in the sales. It is a very much push-sales driven environment. Get a quick buck, you get a raise. Don't imagine a substantial raise if you are in marketing here. Top level management doesn't see the importance of a good long-term marketing strategy.\r\n\r\nAlso be prepared for the cult-like following of the CEO and his philosophy. Very Japanese thing, but this company being my second Japanese place to work, I feel Rakuten's philosophy thing and brain washing is on steroids.\r\n\r\nThe tech divisions and some global departments are quite diverse. But aside of this minority, you'll find yourself surrounded by Japanese people most of the times. Company tries to look like English is it's main language, but make no mistake most of this statements are based on Japanese employees simply passing TOEIC tests. So on paper, yes, very English. Very Basic English. In reality, you'll need to prepare two versions of each document if you want to explain to your team complicated strategies. One in English, one in Japanese. Otherwise, most people won't even understand your point.\r\n\r\nIn terms of work life balance, it depends on the department. But mostly it's quite ok. Except maybe the MNO business. Those people are pulling crazy hours. So you'll probably be ok. Nothing like old times. Also I haven't heard, experience or seen any open discriminations or power abuses.
