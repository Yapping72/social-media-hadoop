I get this feeling because what IT was like 5 years ago is completely different today! It's like they're investing heavily in new generation of IT and technology, unprecedented in the history of GM before!\nAlso the best impression i had of GM is when the pandemic happened, all companies were preparing for layoffs of some form, including reputable ones like LinkedIn and even Google let go of contract employees!! However, GM did something outstanding they've never done before! They cut everyone's salaries and especially executives TEMPORARILY. This granted job security and even better, we got paid back pay WITH INTEREST!!\nI really respected this move on GM's part! What an amazing move that saved the company a couple billion dollars in the face of the pandemic!\n\nTheres a reason the stock price is now equivalent to that of social media giant Twitter's!", "cons": "When I started out, the pay was slightly below market average, but they explained this is because they account for it in other benefits like 2x yearly raise for 3 years, which eventually aligns the pay midpoint to that of the market. So fair enough. I'm not sure if they're still doing that though based on what I heard from new college hires.\n\nRestructuring which led to layoffs was sonething sad but not surprising since when I had HR onboarding 5 years ago, the representatives acknowledged that layoffs are unavoidable when necessary.

When hired for the job, they gave me very little information about what I would be doing. They gave me the name of the team I would be joining, but nothing more about the general tasks of the job. I assumed it would be software development given the title, but it was not. The team I was assigned to was focused on IT work and admin work. While at GM, I barely touched any code as a software developer whether it be developing or testing. I feel like this really left a sour taste in my mouth as I felt I was misled the whole time I was there. There is nothing wrong with IT work, however, there is a clear difference between IT work and software development and it was not made clear what the position entailed.\n-Lots of red tape. It felt like I was spending more of my time getting permissions to do things than actually doing any work. I feel maybe 80% of the the time I spent was navigating the system to do something rather than just doing the work easily. I understand that big corporations have policies that they need to follow, but it is easy to see why startup EV companies like Tesla move much faster and are able to gain a competitive advantage because of this. \n-Too many meetings. Many times there were meetings set up that could have easily been an email, but a 30 minute meeting had to be set up instead. This led to many team members having their full day just packed with meetings, many of which are general team meetings. For example, the daily standup, which usually takes 5 minutes at other companies took us 30 minutes every day. For this project there were too many people in the standup and too much talking about what peoples problems were during the meeting leading to more time spent wasted if the problem wasn't relevant to you. \n-Too many systems to learn. There are so many systems at GM to learn, an uncountable number of them to me. It seems like every week there was new fire to put out from something I had never heard. In addition to this, there is no documentation on what system is used for what and how to use the system, leading for more meetings needing to be set up and more time wasted of those who have to explain what a system does and what it is used for. \n-Pay is low. I get the feeling GM was able to use the pandemic to hire a lot of students at the salary that they could not otherwise because the job market was so tight at the first couple months of the pandemic. I certainly fell into this as I accepted this position at a salary I probably would not have taken if I had other options.
