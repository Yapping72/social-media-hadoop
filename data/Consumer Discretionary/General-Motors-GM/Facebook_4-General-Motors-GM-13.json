I was leaving a top company for what I truly believed was another top company, this is how much I believed in what GM marketed to me. I was told my technical skills and educational degrees would be challenged. It has been about six months since I joined GM and I have been given no such caliber of work. In fact, the most \u201ccomplex\u201d task I have been assigned is to submit a Work Order and create Excel spreadsheets, and yes my title is engineer. I keep asking my manager for challenging work and all I get is \u201cpaperwork\u201d stuff that a 15 year old can do with very minimal training. I have a Bachelors and Masters in Mechanical Engineering and I do not use my education at all in GM. \r\n\r\nI also do not feel safe at work. My manager has an aggressive attitude. He constantly uses bad words and I cannot say the rest to protect my identity, but is not good. He treats his direct report as if we are his kids. I see my co-workers complaining all the time on his back, but they are afraid of speak up. All they say is \u201cthis is a good company with good pay/benefits and I am happy to have a job\u201d. GM indeed pays well and the benefits are very good as I stated above. But I would rather make a lower salary with less benefits at a job where I can be myself and use my skill sets. GM campuses (at least in Michigan) are not tobacco free. All the building entrances smells like cigarette even the conference rooms and restrooms. Sometimes people even smoke in your face. I have even seen people in meetings talking very rude to minorities (including women\u2019s). Is that a sign of a progressive and safe company? I do not think so.  \r\n\r\nThis feels more like a 8-5 job. You can tell a large number of people hate their jobs and they are there just for a paycheck. A large number of people do not respond to emails and some to phone calls. I have even been in situations when I have sent a meeting notice with days in advance and no one shows up. And when you go to their desks you seen them texting, etc. And if you ask them a question they complain and point you to someone else. \r\n\r\nEven at the company trainings you hear the instructions complaining about the company culture. One instruction even joked saying that the GM handshake is \"is not my problem - is someone else's\".\r\n\r\nGM is still a bureaucratic company where employees, mostly individual contributors, are afraid to speak up. Is true that the leadership is trying to change that culture. There are renovations in the Warren Technical Center and constant emails to promote a cultural change through collaboration. But I guess they have to get rid of a lot of people in order to change the company culture.

I wanted to be a full stack developer, they attempted to put me on a mainframe management project.  This would have been career suicide.  I was told \"sometimes at GM, we just get what we get\".  I had to start a political campaign to get myself out of this situation.\r\n\r\nSome teams allow abuse and unrealistic project deadlines to propagate down from the business.  I have seen devs overwork themselves, pushing in code at 2AM and working 12 hour days.  Some managers are ok with this and expect this, and celebrate the \"rock stars\" who are slinging garbage into Bitbucket to just \"get it working\".  Meanwhile, code reviews aren't really a thing, nor is unit testing or any code standards.\r\n\r\nThe staffing strategy is (and has been) literally this - replace the talent who leaves due to being underpaid by eager-to-please college hires.  Lots of tribal knowledge, poor or total lack of standards, and toxic environments are cultivated as a by-product of this.  \r\n\r\nMy advice: if you want to be marketable and are coming into this job.

Management will not care about if that change reflects your expertise/career goals and there will be a lot of deflection as to who even initiated this change (your direct manager, HR, or a Director). On the other hand if you attempt to make a lateral movement to another position available - good luck. Logically, the \"good\" jobs/roles rarely open up because people fight to stay in those teams.\r\n\r\n-The true \"Innovation\" apps at GM are Outlook and Skype (Excel is third). They are management's best friends.  GM uses boring old vendor software but creates even more boring in-house software (yikes). Over 50% of GM software is legacy software written by people no longer there with non-existent/poor documentation. Legacy apps break ALL.THE.TIME. Many times it's because it's inexplicably linked to another app/server because \"it sounded like a good idea\" a long time ago. \r\n\r\n-Bureaucracy is the boogey-man word and Director-level management refuses to accept there exists so much of it. Bureaucracy to install software. Bureaucracy for servers to apps you own. Bureaucracy for production deployments. You will have meetings with people who will stonewall and will bring 2 other people in the call to act as witnesses for their justification. Being proactive will only get you assigned more work and will cause you to become the SME of 3 MORE legacy apps in addition to the 5 you already own. Because of this, teams will actually allow software to break/deadlines to be unmet (with the \"secret\" blessing of managers). Deadlines are constantly made/promised by people who have never been software developers/engineers.\r\n\r\n-Out of the 4 IT \"Innovation\" Centers: Austin and Warren are substantially better especially for your career growth. They get more \"visibility\" and have better projects (again, depends on team). GM focuses too much on Galileo, myGM Rewards, AVT, and MAVEN while disregarding the apps that provide POSITIVE net cash inflows. It seems like other teams exist only to not disturb upper-management by preventing P1/P2's. The message is \"Helping the client/customer great but preferably focus on preventing P1/P2's\". Now, if your team did meet that metric of \"No P1/P2's for the Mid-year Performance Review\"...you still won't get recognized. There exists considerable, outsourcing for apps that GM, itself doesn't believe its employees are qualified to do (ex: AVT). GM avoids open-source software and it has become detrimental to its goal of \"innovation\". Lots of soul-draining repetitive tasks and most of it involves Outlook (aka management's BF). Before you realize, you will have lost knowledge/skills you had in the past. \r\n\r\n-Beware of the IT organizations that have the word \"Global\" in their name. They contain ALL the negatives listed above (such as legacy software) on a larger scale. No exception. The Directors in \"Global\" orgs also are uninspiring, feign transparency, and lack direction (can't have direction when your org consists of projects that aren't innovating/ provide little to the customer). No surprise I saw more turnover in these orgs than other orgs.\r\n\r\n-Most of the discontent is towards Randy Mott's network he brought from Dell and HP (CIO's and especially Directors). Perhaps some of them have quit/were layed-off but for years they ushered in bad practices, bad vendors and fostered nepotism. If you want to \"moveup\" at GM, learn to take data of all the cost-savings you provided into Excel-format, only then you can communicate in a language they comprehend.\r\n\r\n-Not as important as the statements listed above^ but GM has lots of synonym and acronym entities/programs/software that sound alike but are ACTUALLY different things (EX: GM Loyalty/GM Rewards/GM Recognition, Chevy Volt/Bolt, ITOC SE/ITOC SD)"}, {"review_title": "GM IT is a joke, good old boys club in Austin", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Solutions Architect in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay and benefits, company car is a nice perk", "cons": "Political minefield, old boys club in Austin, and not willing to listen to new ideas.

Anyone that can't be intimidated is eventually squeezed out to make for a compliant salaried workforce.  Primary measurement in effect is Cost-per-unit: which is silly when you consider that the only lever that can be pulled at a plant level to adjust this is labor (hint: Understaff on purpose and enforce 'casual' overtime). I've worked or Co-op'ed in several GM manufacturing plants, and this is the case in pretty much every one.\r\n\r\nRumor was, my current facility was dead-last of all manufacturing facilities in the Workplace-of-Choice survey in 2015. What floored me was that the 'interview' portion (which used an outside firm to gather anonymous feedback) was scheduled during a week where the plant was in shutdown: meaning that there weren't any employees around other than the select few that 'just so happened' to be in working overtime projects. To my knowledge, we have not been given the opportunity to do another plant-specific survey since.\r\n\r\nArbitrary measurements: goal plans and glide-paths generally don't reflect real business conditions. Most of the Level 1/2/3 production measurements are set up on a weekly/monthly cycle which greatly rewards short-term decision making. This is especially frustrating for a maintenance expenditure: there's absolutely no way to amortize a large maintenance cost (i.e., a $30,000 motor) on a monthly budget. [Case in point: A machine was failing, replacement part cost was $15,000, but because the plant would have been 'red' for the monthly maintenance budget, instead of planning the replacement and purchasing the components, it was band-aided and continued to run. When it eventually failed the next month, the damage caused an additional $20,000 of collateral damage, and incurred several shifts of downtime until it could be repaired. There was no effort to acknowledge that the additional cost was due to a failure to act, because by the measurements it was a better outcome]\r\n\r\nSystems that are put in place for standardization never seem to be evaluated for efficacy in a closed-loop manner: the end result is a lot of motion that creates the illusion of work. Sad part is, every time there's a 'critical failure' we manage to add yet another required system on top of the 8 that were already there. Why this appears to work: the fear of having to go through another GMS/5-Why/Fishbone/RedX/Root Cause Analysis/Problem Solving Tool/Diagonal Slice/TPM/Six-Sigma/OpEX exercise causes employees to either avoid doing *anything* involving risk, or to hide the mistake and hope no-one finds out (I must point out that Bob Lutz acknowledges and nails this fact very, very hard in one of his recent books)."}, {"review_title": "Cons outweigh the pros", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Oct 2017", "job_title": "Developer in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good HSA plan, work life balance", "cons": "Almost impossible to get promotions, only way is to leave and come back.

You will be corralled into a narrow set of responsibilities, and there are no real opportunities for advancement. You will perform the same repetitive tasks for the rest of your career there. Sure, you can apply internally for different opportunities, but don't expect to get the position. These new opportunities are only posted once the manager has identified the person they want to fill the role, so the interview process is a formality for the pre-selected individual and a facade for all others. Others who apply are out of luck unless the predetermined individual chooses not to accept the new role.\r\n\r\nMy advice to you if you're at GM currently looking for a new role, start brown-nosing and get a manager to submit for a position for you, or look outside the environment. Don't let the \"Golden Handcuffs\" prevent you from looking outside GM for other opportunities either. They are plentiful and often pay better and provide a better overall quality of life / work life balance. \r\n\r\nNo comp time or overtime afforded to those who stay up all night for their manager.

If any positive feedback is provided at all, it is presented half handed and disrespectfully as if your efforts accounted for nothing.\r\n\r\nPer the title, if you qualify under the ADA as a person with a disability, particularly mental, expect no cooperation from your management. HR will require a doctors note for any accommodation request, and if you attempt to circumvent an HR decision about your work situation with an accommodation request from your doctor or complain about your management to the director, despite the zero retaliation policy they say they have, they will target you for termination and find a reason to let you go. They have a team of atty's that will work with HR to find a way to let you go, and block your unemployment and cobra benefits in the process. Simply google \"cobra benefits gross misconduct\" for an example.\r\n\r\nWhile my experience with management was terrible, there are very few managers there that are not abusive terror inducing sadists, so you might get lucky. For your health and the benefit of your family, I highly recommend looking elsewhere for employment opportunities. There is plenty of work out there, carpe diem!\r\n\r\nSenior management is either indifferent to the atrocities of the managers below them or pretends to care,  then supports HR in the targeted termination effort.\r\n\r\nWork Life Balance at GM means you Live to Work.

You will go from 60 (great company, I\u2019m proud to work here) to 0 (I\u2019m ashamed of working here) faster than a hyper car.\r\n\r\n2)\tNo matter how much money you made for the company, or how much experience you bring, or what unique skill set you possess, or how many extra hours you voluntarily worked to make your boss look good, or how many rave reviews you get from the business and your co-workers, if you are not part of the inner circle of your Director, you will never, ever, get a fair year-end review, and you will be eventually let go in the most embarrassing of ways.\r\n\r\n3)\tThe cronyism in IT leadership is cynical and disgusting. There is no way you will advance your career or get promoted if you are not one of the good old boys\u2019 club. I saw many people doing absolutely nothing for the company get better reviews than many of us who were really impacting the bottom line with our work.\r\n\r\n4)\tWhen you are being hired, they sell you the idea that this company is so huge that  opportunities will jump out of everywhere and you can move to other areas if you are not happy where you are. This is a lie. They are willing to let you go before they move you.\r\n\r\n5)\tManagers/Directors are the worst I\u2019ve had to work with in my 20+ year long career. Most of them lack basic people skills, not to mention managing skills. No transparency at all, and always with hidden agendas.\r\n\r\n6)\tLeadership is concerned about costs and will lay off thousands, but at the same time they are the main waste generators. I saw projects thrown out the door after a year of working on them, with labor and hardware resources already paid for; you can see many managers with one or zero people under them; hundreds of people doing nothing, waiting for projects to be approved, especially when you are a new hire. Months can come and go before you get to work on something.\r\n\r\n7)\tThey call themselves \u201cIT Innovators\u201d, but nothing is further than the truth. There is no innovation, only poor attempts at imitation. Don\u2019t fall for the \u201czero crashes, zero emissions\u2026 zero everything\u201d hype. With this IT leadership it simply just won\u2019t happen. How could it, when basic essential processes that could be easily automated are still being managed by pen and paper? Read the news and follow the competition and you will see who really is leading in this area.\r\n\r\n8)\tWorst of all, your career and skill set will come to a screeching halt. They will freeze in time. Due to the red tape, favoritism, or just plain ignorance of the decision makers, you have to work with only the technology approved by them. After leaving, many of us are now facing the reality that all of the latest technology trends that are in demand in the job market are not the ones used here. Getting a job offer will be harder for you if you stay too long in this company, because you will not have the experience with the latest technologies.\r\n \r\nLastly, trust the bad reviews. They are closer to reality than the good ones. I would second guess the good reviews, especially when most of them were entered between February and April of 2019, the period when most layoffs happened. Many of the good reviews were even entered on the same day. I\u2019d be very suspicious of these.

I no longer do. If you were family, I would advise you to avoid GMIT for several reasons:\r\n\r\n(1) There is no defined technical career plan if you don't want to become a Project Manager. GM likes to pretend (lie) that not having a defined technical career plan speaks to the various career opportunities that you will encounter at GM. In reality, out of my 4 years at GM, i saw a grand total of TWO people in my org (about 150 people) get promoted. The rest stayed in same position, switched teams, or left GM altogether. Many of the people in my org who I respected as brilliant engineers inevitably leave GM for greener pastures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) GM doesn't appreciate IT. They talk a lot about having a vision of GM as a tech company while simultaneously offering none of the perks of tech companies and certainly nowhere close to the salary (esp in Austin, a growing tech hub). Pay for coffee, pay for food at \"lunch & learn\" event, etc\r\n\r\n(3) Many of your colleagues in GMIT will be low-performers and you will often have to clean up after them. This is largely due to the complete absence of technical questions during the interview. It's all personality questions. So you end up working with people who are polite and incapable of innovation.\r\n\r\n(4) Many teams don't follow best practices for software development. Code review, continuous integration, blue-green deploy, unit testing, etc .... completely absent on many teams. Your skills will actually end up deteriorating if you're not careful (even as a college grad with a clean slate mind) . Imagine going to an interview for your next job and saying \"we didn't write unit tests\" - who would want to hire that engineer ?
