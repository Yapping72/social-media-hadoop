GM is a massive global company and each location, department, and team has a different culture. \r\n\r\nBenefits - GM's traditional benefits are some of the best you'll get anywhere. Healthcare is very comprehensive and includes an awesome wellness incentive program, and the 401K is probably one of the best of any company in any industry. You'll get a lot of the usual stuff too - corporate discounts, company merch, etc.\r\n\r\nCompensation - Pay is certainly not bad, but can vary in competitiveness by location. IT jobs aren't scaled by how valuable skills are in their respective markets so every gets paid pretty much the same. This is great for the Detroit and Phoenix offices but isn't great in Atlanta and is not competitive in Austin. The company is trying to fix this and has adjusted starting salary for junior employees to be more competitive (although they are hoping more experienced ones will not notice I guess) The bonus is a double-edged sword - on paper it sounds really good but can vary wildly from year to year. It's based more on the overall performance of the company rather than individual merit, so you could have an awesome year but if the company does poorly your bonus will take a big hit. GM has had a couple of great years but last year wasn't so good and this year is shaping to be pretty bad, so don't expect bonuses to pay dividends for a while. This used to be offset by one-off performance awards that would occasionally be given out, but this was recently replaced by a weird game-show-like points system.  Again - overall still good, just not as good as it used to be, or could be.\r\n\r\nTop Management - The C-Suite and executive leadership have an excellent outlook and are usually transparent about the goals and challenges the company is facing. They have a good read on industry trends and try to adapt as quickly\r\nas a giant multi-national company can.\r\nWork-Life Balance - GM doesn't have a sink-or-swim culture, which is excellent for folks fresh out of college. You'll get a lot of support, training, and (usually) reasonable expectations in your first year. If you manage your time well and play your cards right (see Cons section for how this can fall apart) you'll never work more than 40ish hours a week.\r\n\r\nOther - GM has every ELA under the sun, so any tool you need to do your job you'll (eventually) get. Most associate-level employees are helpful and easy to get along with. There's a handful of cynical old cranks and smug millenial/GenX dudebro types but it's not too hard to find a niche.", "cons": "Career advancement - While there are a lot of great learning opportunities in the early stages of an IT career, your prospects dry up fast after about 3 years. GM IT has a horrible habit of burning out top talent - if you establish yourself as a dedicated, talented employee, you are more likely to get stuck with the same work over and over again until you are hating life, rather than interesting, high visibility projects to advance your career because your manager only cares about the bottom line. If you think you can just switch teams think again - constant political battles between middle management make it very difficult to change to a job you'd rather do. And even if you do make the switch, you'll likely mess up your chances for a promotion or have to take a pay cut because HR has way too much control over employee compensation and makes it really hard to get a pay raise. They (HR) recently established quotas for the number of people in each organization that can be at a certain pay/benefit grade, and most teams are over the line so 90% of employees are stuck at their current level, by default. I've seen a lot of people quit recently because they were approved for promotions (sometimes by directors and/or executives) but were denied by HR (a lot of them were women, what's up with that Mary Barra?) who cite \"policy\". \r\n\r\nPerks - Although GM's traditional benefits are very good, a lot of the perks you'd expect to see with a huge car company are just not there. You don't get a company car unless you are a senior manager or higher, and even then you'll likely get stuck with something clunky that GM can't sell. Only the executives get the \"cool\" cars. There used to be an awesome program where more junior employees could try out cars for a week, but the company took it away to cut costs. This really sucks because employee discounts on GM cars are embarrasingly bad - most people use standard retail discounts because they are actually better.\r\n\r\nCulture - GM recruiters sell the IT department as a \"tech startup funded by a multi-billion dollar corporation\". In reality, it's more like a \"large consulting firm under long term contract with GM\" in that there's very little of the aggressive,\r\ninnovative culture that you would see in a startup. Red tape is everywhere - you need 3 to 5 approvals just to get read-only access to a non-secret production database for example. The more established you get, the more time you'll\r\nspend in endless meetings, which usually results in worse work-life balance because you end up doing most of your real work after hours. The rest of GM hasn't really embraced IT either...you'll spend about as much time selling your work as you do actually doing it. \r\n\r\nMiddle Management - Middle management and tech leads are, by and large, awful. There's a few exceptions but most of them are petty, lazy, and constantly playing politics. Many of the ones in Austin have been working together for 20+ years, so there's a lot of nepotism and playing favorites. A lot of the reason for the career advancement logjam that I mentioned before is because some of the managers brought in \"paid friends\" from other companies at job grades way higher than they deserve, so they are enjoying high pay and company cars for very little output and preventing other people from getting promoted. If you aren't part of that culture and don't pay homage to the old boys club, forget about gaining any sort of career clout. Many of them have a consulting mindset and tend to overpromise to the business, signing up their developers for work they either don't know how to do or don't have time for (or both), and which usually doesn't deliver much value or isn't functional, but \"it's what the business wants and we have to do as we are told...so...\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\". Many of them also get road rage in the parking lot and on commutes - we are constantly going over safety messages because the company cars are always getting wrecked or getting tickets for bad driving.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure - GM's IT architecture is ancient, cheap, and something is almost always broken. This can make it really hard to test and deploy code because you'll often have to wait until environments are less busy or fixed in order to do your work. The old Austin IT facility was a former Dell building and was a great work environment. Lots of natural light, bright colors, and open air. The company is moving Austin IT to a new building, and it feels like a massive downgrade. It's an old warehouse which is very obvious. Exposed piping/wiring everywhere, exposed insulation on the ceilings which periodically falls on you, very few windows, drab and grey walls and floors, HOLES IN THE FLOOR UNDER THE CARPET and generally not ergonomic or safe. All the \"renovations\" feel very rushed and cheaply done. Even basic things like bathroom plumbing and water fountains barely work."}, {"review_title": "Disappointment and frustration", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "31 Aug 2009", "job_title": "Marketing Manager in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people working at the company tend to be very strong in company pride and desire to make it a better company.

I was hired out of college and have been here a year and a half so far and I don't have anything to complain about it at all. Compared to my fellow students who worked at consulting firms mostly, it really seems like GM cares way more about people and has more perks. \r\n\r\nI work in software dev, but it has been great, some of the perks:\r\n\r\n- Raise every 6 months for first 3 years as a new college hire. (this is huge, no one else gets raises like this and they have competitive starting rates as other companies for sure)\r\n\r\n- very good health insurance, it's $30 a month, but it's the kind where you don't need a referral to see a specialist. there's a $1500 deductible, but the company gives you a $1500 health savings account every year to use towards it when you do a physical, so basically no deductible, not sure how it would be for families though\r\n\r\n- everyone on earth knows GM, huge resume booster. when you tell people you work here, you always hear \"ooohhh, cool\" and stuff like that. it's a really respectable thing to say you work here. \r\n\r\n- 401k matching, up to 8%. they give you 4% right off the bat of your salary every month, then they match up to 4% on top of that. so if i put in 10% into 401k, and they put in 8%, it would be as if i'm saving 18% of salary each month. the 401k vests in 3 years, so you need to stay for 3 years in order for the money to become officially yours once you work there. \r\n\r\n- able to rotate, you can rotate jobs every 1 year if you want as a college hire, in a company this big, you can pretty much do any job you want once you are in. i know they are big on training people so i think you can go into any other vertical too if they need people. \r\n\r\n- very willing to teach and help you learn more, like sending you to training events and the likes\r\n\r\n- bonus every year based on company performance. the bonuses are pretty decent, as a college hire, then they will put money on top of that if company performance is good. it really depends on company performance though, but so far this year has been a record breaking year so we did pretty good on bonuses. \r\n\r\n- multiple innovation centers to work at. they have people in austin, tx, chandler, az, warren, mi, detroit, mi and atlanta, ga\r\n\r\n- if you have a masters degree... DO IT. you get a higher starting salary then other college hires, and you are locked into the raises every 6 months. once you stay at the company for 3 years, you get promoted into the next level, and that also comes with it's own raise. also, make sure to do an internship or have some kind of experience related to your job before starting, they will start you at a higher salary as well for experience that you've had. my starting salary matched my friends who i went to school with, but they didn't have raises like this. \r\n\r\n- if you have a bachelors, you can start working towards your masters degree and they will pay for it right when you start. they give you enough to cover 1 or 2 classes per semester, which is honestly enough because working full time and doing the degree can be really intense, especially in a graduate degree. \r\n\r\n- if you move from another state, they will give you money to relocate, which is honestly way more then you need as a single person\r\n\r\n- of course, really good experience and really building a strong skillset. i would probably consider working here for a very long time. many people i work with have been working with the company for 10+ years which shows how good it is. \r\n\r\n- this is one i didnt think about, but free parking. it seems like many of my friends who don't work here actually have to pay to park to work at their companies. GM has garages that they cover you on which is nice. \r\n\r\n- the whole company in general is really big on helping it's people. many automotive folks have worked here for years and years and retire here, so I think the old union focus is still here. as opposed to trying to trim down the bottom line for everyone and only care about boosting profits, i really feel like they try to help people out with their benefits compared to other companies i've been to.", "cons": "- honestly, i've had no cons from my experience. i think it really would depend on what team you are on. the management and where you sit make your experience. i've only heard good things from other co workers. but if you don't like your team, you do have the option of moving around as i said before."}, {"review_title": "Good Company Headed in the Right Direction", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "31 May 2017", "job_title": "Software Developer in Warren, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits and competitive pay.

So it doesn't seem to matter if you work hard or if you spend all day chilling. You will be compensated the same and given the same raise. This may be a positive for people  who just want to show up at work and collect a pay check. But it stops people from going out and being ambitious and excelling at work. \r\n\r\nBecause the company doesn't promote or provide opportunities for upwards mobility all of the good talent tends to leave for companies that do give these opportunities. These people are either never replaced or replaced with college hires. As a company we really should be doing a better job of retaining the good talent and letting the bottom people go elsewhere. However it seems to be the opposite. So I'm not looking forward to what GM IT will look like in a few years. \r\n\r\nThe last thing I will say. The salary isn't great. I would say it's at the bottom level of competitive.

There seems to be a large gap in the middle, somewhere to turn to for advice or guidance with the everyday work.\r\n\r\nRecently the work/life balance has started to trend downwards. When I first started the idea was \"Work as much as needed to get your work done.\" In IT, this works well. When we were busy, we would work as much as needed to complete the task, and then when things slowed down we might have only had to work 5 or 6 hours a day. Additionally, working from home was accepted. Over the past 6 months or so there has been a very strong push to ensure everyone is in the office 8-9 hours a day, regardless of workload. This can lead to sitting around on your hands or not getting your work done in a timely manner because everyone clocks out at 5 PM.\r\n\r\nCompensation in some areas is well below par for new hires. The salary for my field is roughly 25% lower than at a less successful company 2 miles down the road. GM tries to push the \"benefits package\" to avert your attention from this in the form of bonuses, but those are entirely company dependent and can easily fail to supplement the lack of a competitive salary. It seems they continue to attempt to lower this bonus each year as well.\r\n\r\nCredit is generally granted to the manager overseeing the work you did entirely on your own. General Motors is a very old company that tends to treat its executives significantly better than its underlings. Successes on projects and endeavours are usually seen as managerial successes and come with bonuses to the manager rather than rewarding the employee. There are plenty of internal programs set up to remedy this, none of which are utilized.\r\n\r\nMoving up in the company can take an eternity.
