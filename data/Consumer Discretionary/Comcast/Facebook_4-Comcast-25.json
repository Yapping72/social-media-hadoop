Free universal tickets and great insurance. They also do what they can to keep employees engaged with parties and incentives.", "cons": "Management is very aggressive when it comes to meeting quotas. They use fear tactics and threaten your job security constantly if you aren\u2019t meeting your metrics. The metrics that they have in place can be difficult to achieve. Especially during Covid-19.\n\nThe work / home life flexibility is pretty rough too. They give you an adequate amount of time off but micromanage how and when you can use it. You must adhere to a strict schedule that literally plans out every minute of your day.  Also, they only do schedule changes once per year. So if you get stuck with something you don\u2019t like, there is no way out of it.\n\nThe pay structure is a joke too. They basically give you a fixed payout regardless on what you sell. They call it a \u201cguarantee\u201d. It used to be whatever you sold was what you earned. Now they give the guarantee so that they don\u2019t have to pay out too much. Even if you perform it\u2019s very difficult to surpass the guarantee. Feels like they are forcing you to leave money on the table. \n\nThe biggest negative I got from the company was how poorly they treat their top performers. Instead of giving them a pat on the back and a thank you, they start investigating you and look for any flaw or inconsistencies in your sales method to get you fired. Simply because they don\u2019t wanna pay high salaries to top earners.\nI have seen many great sales reps leave the company because of how poorly they were treated."}, {"review_title": "Excellent company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Senior Director Sales & Marketing in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits and career development opportunities", "cons": "Recruiting process can take a long time before you receive feedback or a job offer"}, {"review_title": "Very good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Senior Infrastructure Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice work culture and work place", "cons": "compensation needs to be improved for all levels"}, {"review_title": "Good pay and equities, way overworked.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "14 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Senior Manager, Operations in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary is good, good equities", "cons": "Overworked, constant change.

Which the company would prefer that customers use rather than the residential outside sales rep whom are not order takers. In your specific territories that you are assigned to cold call knock each house is color codes. They only want you to target what they have determine to be high value customers. These HVC are coded green that can change at any time. The houses targeted will be coded green, but can literally change at any given time based on internal metrics that cause it to no longer be a qualified green targeted home. Things like home may be occupied by an older person or a single younger millennial. Individuals that they perceive to be customers they won't get most or all the Xfinity services. Folks that they perceive won't spend money on higher packages won't be targeted in your territories. You will be on a street with 50 homes and only 4 or 3 will be targeted. Also, the home history will effect whether its a targeted green or not. If the home had late payments, and old unpaid balance, or not a multi family home even though it not even the same individual who was there before, the house won't be targed. So a new person totally unrelated to the prior owner or renter will be effected color code wise. The house is rated base on all these things and more. If the individual house was green and that person inquired about service, but didn't get it. They and other factors with change the color on the home green to red. You can literally talking to someone at the time that it's green and targeted and when they decide to finally sign up under you, the home can literally no longer green and targeted and won't be a in turf fully paid sale. Any sales made outside of your assigned green territory will not count towards your monthly quota and you will only get paid 25%. Any homes in your territory that's not green will not count towards your quota and you will be paid 25% referrals are penalied .The same homes that are green and targeted for you to cold call are also being mailed special offers with gift cards and free installs that you can't offer. Which is done to take the sale from you even if you made prior contact. You get nothing, management is poor, lazy and protect their favorites and show a blind eye to those they like . Upper management doesn't care about fairness, and you will be retaliated against for point this out not matter how much they tell tell you other wise. Latinos and whites are favor more and opportunity to move to other sales channels aren't allowed much and are flat out blocked.
