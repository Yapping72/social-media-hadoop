You will then go knock doors prospecting for business. At 3:00pm you are required to be back in the Berlin office to make phone calls till 5PM or submit orders, while the manager walks around to make sure people are making calls.\n\nAt 5PM, there is a mandatory team conference call that will last between 30-45 minutes where you will explain what you did that day, how many sales you got, new opportunities found, number of appointments you sat on that day, number of appointments the following day, and your forecast for tomorrow. If you make a sale and it happened to contain voice and data, but the client did not want TV, you will need to explain why you they did not get TV and vice versa.  If you sold a lower tier Internet speed, you will have to explain why it was not a 50Mbps or faster connection.  In some instances the manager will insist going back to the client together and try to convince the client to get all 3 services or to increase their speed, because you as the sales professional, clearly did not listen to their needs the first time.\n\nIf you leave before the call is over you will be labeled a \"non team player\", so hopefully you dont mind traffic. My commute was dificult, but not nearly as bad as the guy who lived in the springfield Massachusetts area (yes he had to be in the office twice everyday too...no exceptions)\n\nTuesdays and Thursdays you will have in person  huddles where they will teach you things such as top down selling, wedge statements, open ended questions, or practice role plays (great information if you have never had a sales job before).  After the huddle you will have a 1 on 1 with your manager or a ride day where he shadows you and tells you what you did right or wrong in a condescending tone.  In the event that you miss a team huddle for being sick or more than 5 minutes late, you will have to make it up later that week with the manager.\n\nOn any given day, there can be no more than 2 people off due to \"business needs\", this includes holidays such as day before thanksgiving, black friday, Christmas eve, day after christmas, new years eve and new years day among others.\n\nI worked there for 3 months and went through velocity training and finished my ramp period.  At the end of that time, my manager held a formal review and said that \"unfortunately it was not going to work out and that I did not have the attitude needed to be successful here\", so i was let go.  Part of me felt bad being rejected and all, but I was also happy knowing that I would not have to endure this horrible and demeaning sales culture any longer.\n\nHad I known before hand what this job was all about, I never would have accepted it.  I have had several sales jobs over my career, recently coming over from the online advertising industry and have never been treated like this before.

What's worse is this is the worst communicating company I've ever worked for bar none.

I have to literally fight my employer (Comcast) DAILY to get what I need to service their customers.  Training is entirely inadequate for company employees.  This is the reason when you call Comcast it depends on who you get as to what kind of service quality you receive.  It's basically up to the person to train themselves, or don't.  Comcast doesn't care and they won't fire anyone for poor performance (no accountability).  That \u2026 and the fact that there are more contract workers here than there are actual company employees and the contract workers have zero accountability. \r\n\r\nThe further up the leadership chain you go, the more disconnected they are from what's going on at your level.

fired your expected to have a 40% general attachment rate which means for every 10 calls you receive you have to sell 4 services minimum to pass and you must have a 75% video attachment rate minimum as well so every time you sell a service you need to sell video along with it 3/4 of the time to pass your metrics and not get written up or fired which is extremely tough because almost everyone that will be calling in will be wanting to open an account with internet only and Comcast puts commercials saying they can get internet as low as $19.99 a month to get people to call in but you wont be able to pass your metrics if thats all you sell.\r\n\r\n- There are customers that will flat out refuse to add video service and will refuse your sales pitch no matter how much you explain about the benefits, tie it to their needs, explain the features, etc but Comcast will keep pushing you to make people get video to meet the 75% minimum video attachment rate if you want to pass your scorecard and not get written up or fired. \r\n\r\n- Supervisors and Managers will constantly be pushing you to sell triple play packages and quad play packages to customers who may only want 1-2 services.   \r\n\r\n- Not all the calls you receive are sales calls, only about 10% of the calls you receive are actual sales calls and the rest are people who dialed the wrong extention or just dialed any extension in the automated system to get to a live person when they were trying to reach a department like billing, tech support, or the disconnections department but here they are speaking to the sales department and each call you receive that you dont sell anything lowers your attachment rate (even if its not a sales call) so good luck making that 40% general attachment rate to pass scorecard.\r\n\r\n- Alot of people will call in just to ask for information about promotions or prices but have no intention of buying anything on the call and if you try to close the sale with them they will say things like \"I have to talk to my spouse before making a decision\", you offer to call their spouse and they will say that their not available, you offer to call them back at a later time and they wont pick up their phone at the time they agreed for you to call them back 99% of the time.\r\n\r\n- On top of the attachment rate goals there are also other metrics you have to meet to pass scorecard like revenue per call, total revenue sold, amount of security systems sold (need 2 minimum monthly to pass), Quality Analysts score (how good you follow a script), and their talking about adding more things to the scorecard as well.\r\n\r\n- If your not meeting your sales goals you will be constantly harassed every day you come into work by your supervisor and their manager asking what your doing to improve your numbers, trying to get you to compete against other agents, hinting that if you dont improve your sales you may be written up, put on a performance improvement plan that prevents you from switching to another department that might be a better fit for you, and letting you know every day that being on a performance improvement plan is 1 step away from getting fired, etc.\r\n\r\n- The Comcast commercials are deceptive because they advertise that you can get $19.99 internet but its really $24.99 and you receive a $5 discount if you sign up for automatic payments and bills via email if not you pay $24.99 and Comcast advertises that it \"comes with 5 lines of mobile already included\" but each mobile line is $45 a month for unlimited data or $12 per each GB of data (which is said in the small letters in the commercial that people dont read).\r\n\r\n- You have to constantly follow up on your orders to make sure nobody cancelled your sales order and re-entered it with their sales id because you only have 3 days to dispute it after the installation completes if not the person who stole your sale gets the credit for it.\r\n\r\n- 90 day chargebacks on your sales if the customer disconnects for any reason even if their moving to a new location within 90 days or if they installed in one address and then changed their apartment number or address within 90 days.\r\n\r\n- Sales department works all holidays\r\n\r\n- The script you have to follow is constantly changing and the Quality Analysts deduct points for petty things and knit pick your calls so that nobody has a perfect score.\r\n\r\n- The company is always changing and restructuring, I used to work in National Bilingual Retention for several years and then one day all of a sudden the company director comes in and tells everyone in the call center to go to a room for a meeting to make an announcement and they tell us that Spanish Retention is getting outsourced to Mexico, English Retention is going to be based out of Jacksonville,  FL and the Philippines, and that our call center is getting converted to Regional Spanish only Sales which I thought wasnt so bad at first because I wouldnt have to deal with irate customers anymore from Bilingual Retention until I actually started working in Spanish only Sales and saw all the unrealistic sales goals they have to pass the scorecard and all the things agents have to deal with to make the company happy.\r\n\r\n- Commission isnt what it used to be, I used to make better money working in National Bilingual Retention than I do now working as a Regional Spanish only Sales agent. \r\n\r\n- Lack of positions to move to, I tried seeing if maybe there was another department that I could transfer to since im not happy in Spanish only sales but the company barely posts job openings for internal employees that want to switch departments, they would rather hire new people from outside to fill positions. \r\n\r\n- Comcast used to raffle out big prizes for selling like 50+ inch LED TV's, Xbox, Playstation, ipads, etc but that all stopped once our center became Spanish only Sales."}, {"review_title":

Spend 8 hours a day in an auto-dialer working tired, worn-out, unrefined leads...and sounding like a complete idiot on the majority of these calls while you're waiting for the computer screen to catch up to who you have on the phone.  You will call about 100 businesses each day (or more) and most of them hang up on you the instant they hear the word \"Comcast\".  Those that don't are likely already Comcast Business customers which shouldn't be in your list in the first place since the OBSR position's focus is NEW ACQUISITION.  But...in spite of the company being keenly aware of this problem, they do NOTHING about it other than encourage you to sell whatever lines of business the customer doesn't already have, regardless of whether it's a service that will benefit the business or not.  When I say worn out and tired leads, I'm also talking about the fact that the company recycles leads like crazy and changes the name of the list but not the leads in the list.  Here's the basic formula for the OBSR department: spend as little on leads as humanly possible and keep constantly hiring more poor suckers to call through them over and over again...then, after the Marketing OBSRs are done with a list, send it over to the Qualified OBSRs and call all those poor souls that didn't get weeded out of the list a few more times.\r\n\r\nAlso, you will call a TON of Home-Based Businesses that are already using Xfinity Residential Service and you're expected to flat out LIE to the customer about how much better Comcast Business service is to justify the much higher price point.  The truth is that there are only a few differences between Xfinity and Comcast Business and those are rather minor differences at best.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Comcast has a TERRIBLE reputation in the industry and in spite of claiming that \"customer service should be our best product\" they are doing very little to back those words up with any sort of action.  At least once every couple days you'll call someone the company has burned in the past and that person is going to let you have it.  \r\n\r\nOne other thing to be aware of is that the company does not work together.  As a telemarketer, you'll fight to keep sales that the door-to-door guys will steal.  Other phone jockeys even in your same call center will also try to poach your deals.  Many of the technicians will tell your customers all kinds of crazy things to get out of doing their job.  Other departments are set up as checks and balances and will reject deals you submit for all kinds of silly bureaucratic reasons...which means your customer has to wait while the company foolishly fights amongst itself.  \r\n\r\nI could go on here all day listing cons...but these things above are the major issues.  The bottom line is, if you don't mind making a total fool of yourself through no fault of your own, telling people outright lies in order to get deals, and working for a company that people truly hate...it's not a bad place to work, at least while you keep interviewing at other places where one can take pride in being an employee there.  However, if you're any sort of decent salesperson who has ethics, integrity, and any sort of moral compass, you're not going to want to stay there long.

Customer assistance fell by the wayside when we would no longer support half the equipment that we provided subscribers (ie routers, gateway systems and phone products). The same time the training for the job was getting less and less for any new products, it would get so bad that you would be asked by the customer how a certain new product worked and it would be something that you hadn't even heard about. When training was offered it was months after the fact, and rushed also to get a whole days training into a 45 min session. Last year my former tech support department was dissolved locally and moved to a different city so I was offered to reskill to stay local or commute. I reskilled, the reskill training was no better, anyone coming from tech department to the retention department previously would go throught a 6 week training program going over all types of things, we were given a week training and most of the time it was making posters and different signs not doing any real sales training or anything really pertinent to the job. After this for about 2 months I was sat with a supervisor that did nothing to help me to transition to this new position that I feel was forced on me. All around me people who know their job are being replaced by people who do not, and are giving out false and incorrect information.  Now I am being told that the new people off the street are getting the sales training that was denied to me and others. Wouldn't it make sence to invest in your long time employees since they know the products like the back of thier hand. My voice of the customer rating is constistently at or around 100% and that means absolutely nothing now since now matter how happy they are with me if I dont sell them something else on top of what they have then I get knocked down regardless. If someone calls in now to lower ther bill and you are able to keep the services they have and RETAIN them as a customer it still means nothing since you didn't up their bill with another service that they don't want. Most people who get on my phone called a few days before and were charged something that they don't need or want to get a rep's commision higher and then I have to remove it to keep a customer or they will cancel. So at that point my stats go down lower so I can maintain my own ethical morals to help someone. I am currently looking for another place of employment so that I am not forced to undermine my own credibility by continually lying to the customer about not being able to help them save moeny when I see a lower price but giving this to them means cutting my nose off.

I was told by a recruiter that based on my education, my base pay would be a bit higher. A whopping 75 cents higher.  Considering all the call center reps deal with, the long hours and the pathetic attendance policy, you\u2019d think they would at least pay their employees a minimum of $18/hr to start. They\u2019re a well known company, I think you can afford to pay your employees better than that. They try to sucker you in with the idea of \u201cmonthly incentives\u201d and \u201csales goals\u201d to help raise your pay, but it\u2019s the most minuscule amount they could possibly give you. Also, you receive an annual bonus. But don\u2019t expect to see that bonus if you have 1 unexcused absence. \r\n\r\n*Attendance policy is unrealistic - if you miss 10 minutes-50% of your shift you receive .5 UAP (unexcused absence). If you miss 51%-100% of your shift you receive 1 UAP. 3 UAPs total and you are fired (if you don\u2019t have any vacation/flex/float time). It\u2019s unrealistic to hold employees to this standard. Life happens, and this company needs to be aware of that.\r\n\r\n*Hours are ridiculous - You can either work 5 8 hours shifts or 4 10 hour shift. Saturdays are mandatory no matter what you choose. A call center should be open during regular business hours. There\u2019s no need to be open past 5:00 pm, let alone on a Saturday. \r\n\r\n*Training is extensive and over the top - They put you through 6 weeks of training that consists of videos, readings, quizzes and practicing calls. Which doesn\u2019t help you retain any information at all. It\u2019s basically like you\u2019re in school for 8 hours a day. They throw all of this information at you and expect you to remember every last detail about all of their services. Then have the nerve to tell you, \u201cdon\u2019t get used to it because these will probably change in 6 months.\u201d\r\n\r\n*Leaders give you the run around when it comes to asking for help - Asked a trainer a question regarding benefits information, she told me to reach out to a supervisor. So, I asked two of the supervisors (via email) for help. Both ignored me. Tried again with supervisor A and she told me to ask a peer to help me. You are a supervisor, YOU are the one who is supposed to help me. I reached out to supervisor B, and she finally assisted me.

Also be prepared for your manager to text you as late as 11pm and early as 5:45am.\r\n-If you have suggestions on ways to adapt certain procedures/scripts to your market, you'll be reprimanded. Corporate's word is law, and how dare you know what'd work best for the local culture that you're working in every day?! Every person, situation and territory functions exactly like sales role plays and trainings done in Philly, period. You better not dare question that or your job will be threatened.\r\n-Most managers will hoard the hot leads across their region for their drinking buddies. If you try to contest it, or get to that account first through door knocking, they'll chew you out for \"stealing business\" and \"breaking the rules of engagement\".\r\n-Think this is a M-F job? Ha! You'll be pressured to work AT LEAST one Saturday a month. If not more, depending on your manager. If you decline because you have other obligations, be prepared to be put on blast for it at your next team meeting.\r\n-There's no care for employee safety, despite this being an outside sales role. Severe thunderstorm? Better be knocking! Tornado watch? Why isn't your number of doors higher?! Live in a Southern state that can't handle snow, and you've already gotten record breaking amounts of it that's shut down your entire territory? Ha! Just a little snow! Go knock those doors or we'll write you up!"}, {"review_title": "Great Pay!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Sales Professional in Modesto, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Commission structure after first year! \r\nLots of incentives\r\nBase salary \r\nCommissions \r\nBenefits \r\nPaid time off. 120 hours a year. \r\nCompany phone and iPad\r\nFuel reimbursement", "cons": "It\u2019s hard to have a work life balance when you work direct sales.

New employees at my location were given impossible territories while veterans were allowed to cherry pick and use banned selling tactics. Shady business practices are overlooked by management as long as results are achieved, all the while being constantly reminded via memos and meetings that such practices are not allowed. This is done so that any time one of these shady deals goes wrong, the sales person can be thrown under the bus and management can claim they didn't know what was happening.  \r\n\r\nCustomer service is absolutely embarrassing. You're told to promise customers the moon to get them to sign a contract and tell them they can call you if they have any problems. When they do inevitably have problems, the company won't help the customer. The customer calls you for help. As their sales person, you call the customer service on their behalf to find that they won't help you either! You're usually referred back to your manager who is busy selling himself, and has no interest at all in helping your customer. Worse than that, my manager would say it was taken care of - which I would pass on to the customer, and then nothing would change. \r\n\r\nThe net effect is that you look like a big liar. You tell your customer you're taking care of their issues, and then it doesn't happen even though you've gone through all the proper channels --- over, and over and over.

The agents I worked with really cared about getting customers' equipment/services working, but Comcast corporate does not share that same outlook.  Comcast pushes their repair agents to sell, sell, sell, and that is where the other 10% comes in - to meet the unrealistic metrics of their repair center, some agents feel the pressure to add services to customer's accounts without their knowledge.  Comcast does nothing about this - just as long as you are selling.   You are given very little repair training in their 6-week training course, which is a joke.  During training, Comcast brings in Supervisors from the floor to talk about their great Comcast experiences.  They come in all smiles, helpful, friendly - but when you get on the floor - no more smiles or helpfulness. You are informed in training that if you EVER need to go to the bathroom go - but once on the floor - you get an IM from several Supervisors asking you to take your bathroom breaks on your own time.  Which if you start work at 1pm and your first break isn't until 3:45pm makes it a bit difficult to hold.  You get consistently scolded for going to the bathroom or helping out another agent because \"Aux\" time is way more important (FCC rules - so they say) than your well being or helping a co-worker. There is no consistency on the floor.  Some agents get by with sleeping at their desks and then others like me, just wanting to go to bathroom - gets a written warning.  Also, they give you 10 minutes to start your computer and all of the necessary programs to do your job. This takes a full 10 minutes. Then Comcast does not give you the opt. to review emails, service updates, trending logs, important information to do your job effectively.   Instead, they demand you do this on \"YOUR OWN TIME\", so basically you are working overtime, without the pay - the last I remember, this was \"illegal\".  I brought this to the attention of the director & vp of Comcast - was told to \"read quickly\".   Once I informed Comcast of this, is when I began receiving IMs from Supervisors about going to the bathroom. They pushed me out the door with their harassment.

All Comcast cares about is money and if you have an issue, don't bother bringing it up because supervisors and management are trained to only talk positive about something that is not.

When I am gone, my numbers still count against me. It's impossible for someone in the military to get a raise when they are not here making the already impossible productivity to rework metrics. Overtime is forced on employees. Supervisors do not care nor help when really needed. Pay is awful for the type of work we do. I've been here for 3 years and still make the same as when I started. Customers yell at us even though it's not our fault the company lies to them, climb up sketchy poles and have to work in some of the most filthy cockroach infested houses for a merely 15 an hour. Insurance is expensive so it's like you get paid minimum wage, and the vehicles given to us are falling apart, but because Comcast only cares about saving money, deal with it. They get on your about productivity, but it's impossible when you have to sit and wait for a modem to boot up for 30 minutes or longer, then you have to wait for a pht test another 40 minutes for hopefully the devices to pass. If something doesn't pass, you're there even longer to figure out why and getting a phone call from the supervisor asking what's taking so long. You can't make your next job, too bad, they have no other tech to give it to and your getting a late which also affects your numbers. Oh and after every job, the customer gets a call to take a survey about how you did it how they feel about the company... They hit the wrong number or you don't get perfect 5's or 10's, don't even think about getting promoted for the rest of the year. This company is a joke and like I said, all they care about is money. They make you take a survey every month and scare you into giving great scores because it affects the supervisors, and if anyone does say anything negative, they don't bring it up. Not to mention that equipment never works. After waiting 30+ minutes for something to boot up, cross your fingers it works because you may have to go through another 30+ minutes after swapping out the first piece of equipment.

Most of the time it fails because of the network team yet you still gotta find a way to fix everything, aka your taking the blame!\n\n(Network team)- god forbid you have to call them to verify its an issue on there side, they will grill you, talk to you with no respect tell you that its your fault and make you do extra things just to prove to them that its not something you can fix.\n\n(Bonuses)-after like 4 months you get this taxed bonus check that is given to you based on how you peformed in a quarter, its also based on the whole office peformance, so if the office did bad, guess what!

More clueless directors, middle and upper management. No wonder customers hate Comcast. Everything has become so disjointed, and inconsistent. There has been WAY too much outsourcing. The company has outsourced so many job functions, that it has lost direction. Departments are often working at cross-purposes. \r\nPay is WELL below industry peers. All management knows how to do is micro-manage and change direction. Every new VP or upper management member that comes in drastically changes our direction and organization, just so they can look like they're trying to improve things. All this does is disrupt employees' lives by either a layoff or quintupling commutes! All for no real benefit. The micro-managing is done by middle and upper management trying to control things they have never done or have any idea about whatsoever. Different departments are at odds with each other.\r\nManagement will not even consider letting employees, whose whole jobs are on the PC, work from home. I believe this is more of their micro-management. Pay is different for employees doing the exact same job. Those of us who are motivated and work hard are given more work, while those who slack are left alone to slack off some more, even spending their day on IM with their love interest. . Upper management has enacted pay caps, basically eliminating employee motivation. I'm sure management hasn't capped their pay, have they? Great behavior for a multi-billion dollar company.\r\n\r\nSo much of customer service has been outsourced, both in and out of country, that the customer frustration factor has increased exponentially. Management needs to realize that you get what you pay for.\r\nSince removing motivation for long-term employees, it seems the drive is to try to get rid of those of us who have been here long-term in favor of new employees they can pay less.\r\nAlso, HR is completely useless; merely a mouthpiece for upper management. Their employee retention policy is to tell us \"be happy you have a job.\" WOW, there's a motivator.....to look elsewhere.\r\nUpper management is so disconnected from reality. They really have no idea what is going on beyond our stock price. You let the bean counters make WAY too many of the decisions.\r\nEmployee morale is is so low, as to be nonexistent. We all hate our jobs. The only thing keeping us coming in is our paycheck. This used to be a career for me, but since 2010, its just a paycheck. Employee morale is so low because we all know things will NEVER get better. Management needs to realize that their smoke and mirrors attempts (Credo-speak survey, Credo-Pulse survey) to give the impression that they are trying to improve things don't fool us.\r\nLocal management does what they can.

The job was everything you would want it to be just as long as you made your numbers/sales and were in compliance with company policies.\r\n\r\n-Employees received high recognition for their accomplishments.\r\n\r\n-Base salary plus commission, All company products were discounted to the employee, gas allowance, new uniforms and supplies provided, bonuses for high producers w/ the possibility to achieve a 6 figure income.", "cons": "-Everything that was a PRO usually changed on an often basis because management was ever always shifting around after my first year.\r\n\r\n-Within the two years that I worked for Comcast, 7 direct and senior managers were either replaced, fired, or asked to resign.  The shift in management is still ongoing from my understanding.  \r\n\r\n-Always constant change with how the sales reps were able to make sales. One minute you might be paid for a sale, the next day, it might be taken away from the rep due to the area that it was sold in.  The next week, the rep may be able to sell in that same area again with no penalties.\r\n\r\n-Comcast is in competition with itself.  As a sales rep, I constantly had to not only sell against Direct TV, Dish Network, and AT&T U Verse, but also Comcast itself.  I had clients who consistently found better deals through Comcast.com, a local retailer, 3rd party retailers, etc than I was able to offer them.  The only way that I could insure a sale is by hoping to find the customer before they were able to find the lower sale price.\r\n\r\n-Your sales depend on many factors. \r\n 1. The call center has to key your sale in perfectly.\r\n 2. The technician who does the installation for the sale must show up for the job, do their installation up to standard and educate the customer on the products (to which sometimes a tech will blow off a job or work short cuts that will hinder the customer's experience).  \r\n3.  The customer must stay happy with your product or you will be charged back.  Most sales team managers will tell you that a customer must call 1-800-Comcast if he/she has a problem.  The problem is that if you present yourself as the direct liaison (to which you are encouraged by the team leaders  to do to get the sale) between the customer and Comcast, then the customer will be contacting you when there is a problem with their system.  The answer the team leaders tell you to give to the customer is \"Call 1-800-COMCAST\".\r\n\r\n-1-800-COMCAST has the worst customer service in the world.  You can be on hold for over 45 minutes and then your call is dropped.  Calling back within the very next second will cause the caller to have to wait possibly just as long again.  \r\n\r\n-Weekly meetings were always changed.  Sometimes the meetings were just a few phone call meetings and one meeting as a team at the local Comcast office.  My former team leader would have no regard for time and sometimes extend the meeting from late morning into the mid afternoon.  Then we were made to attend daily meetings at the office for as short as 30 minutes.  This would cause most sales reps to drive 30-60 mins to the office, just to turn around and drive 30-60 mins back to their designated turf areas.  Comcast would only reimburse the rep for $300 (before taxes) of gas monthly.  \r\n\r\n-When Comcast offered gift cards to close a sale between a sales rep and the customer, the company rarely ever delivered on giving the customer the gift card.  When I was a rep, we had a chance to lure a customer away from their current television/internet provider  by offering up to $400 in gift cards.  Many clients never received their gift cards which left stress between the client and the sales rep.\r\n\r\n-If the sales rep makes a mistake with a customer's order, and the order is completed or closed out, the stress is left between the customer and the sales rep.  The company will not try to repair the incident.\r\n\r\n-Team Leaders just want to keep their jobs.  Team Leaders would rather fight for their own jobs instead for their team member's even when they know the decisions of the company's sales management are ethically questionable.\r\n\r\n-Turf management (the sales reps respected sales area) for sales reps was directed by upper management based on clients and addresses who have not had Comcast before.  Most of those addresses designated by management were empty lots where there were unfinished subdivisions, or sometimes even Trailer parks that were no longer in existence. You cannot sell to a client or house that isn't there.\r\n\r\n-If you decide to leave the company, you will not be permitted to return.  Even if you were a top producing employee with no disciplinary record and have left a two week notice, you will not be permitted to go back to work for Comcast.  The inside word (from management) is that if an employee leaves the Comcast company then he/she will not be permitted to return due to the fact that since the former employee left Comcast in the first place, it shows a sign of non-commitment to Comcast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Newer employees often felt disheartened toward coming into a job with shifting management"}, {"review_title": "Customer Account Executive", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Aug 2016", "job_title": "Customer Account Executive in York, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Comcast is a great company that offers outstanding benefits and promotes positive employee morale.

This method consists of pining its employees against each other, particularly the front-line employees against their own supervisors. Managers (the supervisors of supervisors) are tasked with holding meetings with front-line employees to solicit feedback on their supervisor's behavior. Of course, these meetings are sanctioned by HR and are held without the presence of supervisors. During the meetings, managers get the employees wound up to say anything, and will use this information to provide corrective action against the employees' supervisors. There is no need for the manager to have his own knowledge of the capacity of the supervisor. In fact, if the manager knows the supervisor well, he may be in a position to understand that the feedback provided by these meetings could be prejudiced, because of the \"gang up\" behavior produced when folks are free to talk without being held responsible for their words. If this personal knowledge were ever an issue (a liability in the process), they would rotate the managers to different work locations, eliminating any history between the manager and his supervisors. This way the managers will depend on the feedback provided by the front-line employees as the only source for corrective actions. This process is used against one supervisor at a time, and its main focus is to push unrealistic goals against all employees. The process is similar to what has been uncovered recently with the scandal related to Wells Fargo. Companies have to stay competitive, but some have found methods to boost their performance beyond the limits. What they do initially is create unrealistic goals for the employees. At first, the employees which are loyal to their own work ethics will be the first to go out the door. They will be dismissed for not meeting the goals. The ones that stay behind and survive realize that they can only do so by cheating. Although the company is squeezing the goals, it does not necessarily increase the level of ethics compliance. That is, it does not pursue ethics compliance as a hot potato, in the same way they pursue the goals watched by investors. The cheats then artificially increase the performance of the company, which is a win for the investors as well as the company, but not necessarily for the employees. Management understands that employees are cheating, although they act like managers are completely out of the picture, and they exhibit this extraordinary level of performance as a well planned, well executed, and natural occurrence. However, if they have a problem with an employee, all they have to do is expose the employee's ethics. I mean, at that level they could literally expose anyone and get rid of them. Unrealistic goals happen in many areas, but two of the critical ones are sales and quality. If the profits look unrealistic, it may very well be that the methods for obtaining these profits are also unrealistic, and primarily unethical. While I was working at the technical side of Comcast, the unrealistic goal was the repeat service call metrics (a quality measure that accounts for repeat service calls, within a 30 day period after a technician visits a customer's home). This metric was just below the 8%, and right now (a year after I left) it may be at 7% or less. Every year it was been dropped to a new and even more unrealistic level, with no sign of stopping, and every day you could increasingly hear the talk about how the cheaters made it happen. The team becomes divided between cheaters and non-cheaters. If a non-cheater tells a cheater; \"let's all be part of a team and tell us your methods, so we can improve our performance,\" the usual response is \"I'm not doing anything different than anyone else.\" It's essential for employees to learn and improve their performance through other folks' experiences (although this sharing of information is not really promoted within the company), but there is no real magic bullet that anyone is willing to share. These unrealistic goals create a level of stress that can't be properly managed by the employees, and a great part of it ends up as the wrath generated against supervisors during these feedback meetings. Since the managers depend solely on the feedback of these meetings to make critical decisions about the supervisors, the whole exercise provides a means to target supervisors at will, while at the same time continuing to stage unrealistic levels of performance for their employees. This happens without Comcast, or its upper management, ever becoming responsible for any prejudice done.  However, the prejudice is done with the targeted pinning of employees against themselves, as required by the needs of the business. It\u2019s a business driven with fear that produces a very toxic environment, with false readings and performance, and where employees are stripped of their humanity."}, {"review_title": "Hard job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Oct 2016", "job_title": "Retention Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The company is generous with commissions, has amazing benefits, and is constantly giving out free stuff and prizes", "cons": "Customers hate you and it is extremely stressful.

Two home security sales every two weeks, yet the top ranking team had 1.5 home security per rep last fiscal month. Most reps will hardly ever sale a phone or a home security. Even if you do, charge backs will become the bane of your existence. Get 10 sales, maybe 5 get installed. Hopefully 2 won't charge back. Never sell to friends or family or neighbors. Either they will have problems or they will charge back on you. Be prepared to live on $27,000 a year, ruin a vehicle, be micromanaged, constant stress, and never have time with your family.

While fighting for the customer, you will learn that for a communication company, there isn't any communication between departments. Tech ops, direct sales, .com, etc are always at odds.

You definitely get what you pay for.  They expect you to handle any and every situation successfully within a few minutes.

They have virtually impossible sales expectations but still want you to upsell products and services even when customers really don't need or want them.  It's no wonder they have been in the Customer Service Hall of Shame top 5 slots for the most part of the last decade.  It is completely pointless when filling out their internal surveys or participating in the focus groups (they claim to want to know your thoughts and opinions) because they never listen to their low level employees.  If you happen to be a member of management, you are never wrong even when it can be proven that you were wrong.  Non-management employees get blamed for everything and when you provide your evidence of their wrong doing or your innocence, you get labeled as some sort of a domestic terrorist.  Therefore, don't look for any type of praise but definitely expect to be reprimanded.  Also, don't look for any type of assistance from management.  Some of them could care less about helping you and the others can't help you because they don't know what they are doing.  There were very few supervisors/managers that actually knew the job and even fewer that cared.  Any type of upward or lateral mobility is a struggle even when you have the education, work ethic, and experience.  Plan on being stuck in that position of yours for a while.  Communication between departments is a joke.  The left hand never knows what the right hand is doing and vice versa.  I even heard a customer say, \"How is it that a telecommunications company doesn't communicate?\" I hated telling people that I worked there because I received so much backlash due to people's experiences which made it hard to defend and disagree with them."}, {"review_title": "Coordinator II, Technical Product Sales Support", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great position to learn the inner workings of the company.
