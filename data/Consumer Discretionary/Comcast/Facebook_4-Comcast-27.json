If you aren't up for lots of knocks on doors, lots of rejection and being watched--walk away from this job, it just isn't for you.  \r\n\r\nSuper high pressure sales job.  Two months of not meeting quota=no more job.  Upper management is completely disconnected with the sales force.  Expect to work in all weather--management will.  Unless there is a weather emergency, you are expected to work.  (Outdoors, knocking on residential houses for new business.)  Micromanagement to the max.  GPS tracking on your company supplied Ipad, all company supplied phone calls recorded, all customer contacts expected to be recorded.  If you don't like being monitored, this definitely isn't for you.   \r\n\r\nExpect the whole office to know if you haven't made your numbers.  Management loves to shame those who are having difficulty.  Customer service for the purpose of referrals used to be expected.  Now it is forbidden.  The turn of the new year (to 2014) has shown lots of changes.  No more good promotions (incentives for the customers to buy from you vs. the call center where you don't get credit for the sale).  Higher deposits for new customers.  Cut in pay if you get a referral (not worth as much to the company, apparently)...so another reason to pay you less.  Commissions are frequently wrong.  More time out of your week to make sure you get paid correctly--expect it to be a battle.  The finance people look for reasons to pay you less, and they will if you let them.  \r\n\r\nOverall--used to be a great job a year ago.  Not so much anymore.  \r\n\r\nMy personal opinion--Comcast is getting ready to end this division through two ways:\r\n1.) Make it impossible for reps to reach quota, thus they didn't do their job.

Because you are an employee of Comcast and no longer considered a customer, any repair requests or changes that you may have, even if it's equipment related, which you are required to pay for can take several weeks to complete. Courtesy Services does not work quickly at all when it comes to employee repair issues.\r\n\r\nSecond: In regards to the job itself. I was hired for video repair. Now, I'm not idiot, so I assumed being a multiple service provider, some upselling and upgrading would probably be required, however, this is not the case. You don't find out until your SECOND day of employment (first day is orientation), which is your first official day of training that your primary goal is sales. It doesn't matter how mad the customer is, how many missed appointments they've had, or how many times they've flat out been lied to by other reps, you're still required to try to get a new line of service on them. An elderly lady calls you because her DTA ($1.99 basic cable box) doesn't work and says there's an interruption in service (more so than not, this means the box is bad and needs to be replaced), and while discussing the situation she happens to state she's on a limited income and can't afford a technician to come out and replace the box (free if it's the equipment, $39.95 if it's ANYTHING else), if you don't want it get scolded by management, you better try to sell her digital voice, or internet. She has a DTA? Better try to get her up to either a Digital set top box so she can get On Demand, or better yet, Just get her into an HD Triple Play package. I feel absolutely mislead about the job I interviewed and was eventually hired for. Had I known it was a driven primarily by sales, I never would have accepted the position in the first place.\r\n\r\nThird: Career Advance Path (or, how to keep you in one spot until you can be replaced by trainees, because they trainees will be paid $11.00 USD per hour starting and can be easily replaced). This path was setup as a way to \"promote\" from within based on how hard you want to work and prove your worth to the company. You have 6 months from your hire date to go from CAE: Level 1 Representative to CAE: Level 2 Associate. This comes with a $1.00 USD pay increase. The problem with this are the metrics involved. While you are required to meet four of the metrics for promotion, I will focus on the three that are almost impossible. The first is TSRs, those are your sales, but not just sales. They have to be new lines of service. That means if someone only has cable, you better sell them internet, or phone. If you can sell a triple play, then you get 2 TSRs. You have to meet a percentage of 0.58% (absolute bare minimum) of sales on all of your total calls. On average, you can take 600 or more calls per fiscal month. 0.58% doesn't sound like much at all, especially over the course of 600 or more calls, right? Well that's 34.8 new lines of service. Now 600 is a high number. That would be on a very high call volume month. More accurately, you're probably going to take between 400 and 500 calls, so the number of TSRs required will raise or drop based on the number of calls you take per week, per month.\r\n\r\nThe next metric that really matters is called VOC: Voice of the Customer. Ever call Comcast and while you're waiting for a rep, the recording asks you if they can call you back to take a brief survey about your experience? That's what VOC is to employees. By default, you start at 100% monthly. Now, if you can maintain 100% per month, that pretty much just means that out of all of your calls, everyone opted out of that survey, so there was nothing to bring it down. While this survey is meant to be a way of the customer to give their opinion as to how I the representative helped you, most look at it as a reflection of the company, and oddly enough, we have a running slogan at Comcast, \"No one is calling to tell you how happy they are with the service\" and that's the truth. Unless during the survey, when given the opportunity, the customer actually records a voice message stating the rep they spoke to did an amazing job, anything negative that they report about Comcast directly reflects on the rep themselves, even if we successfully helped you. The customer is never made aware of this.\r\n\r\nThe final metric I want to discuss is called FCR: First Call Resolution. What this means to the rep is as follows. Say you're a Comcast customer and you're having issues with your video (since I only worked in video) and you call in and select the video option and get me. I have two options at my disposal. First and foremost, I want to troubleshoot the problem, because in most situations, the problem can be resolved by sending a refresh signal to your defective box (unless you have a DTA with a blinking light. If that light is blinking, you need your box replaced 9 times out of 10). After sending the refresh signal, we will ask you to disconnect the power to your faulty box for about 20 to 30 seconds then plug it back in. After a reboot process from the box, in most circumstances, your services will be restored. If these steps do not work, we have on other option, we send a technician out to your house. Now, we will tell you that if the problem is with the equipment, the service call is free, and this is true, however, the technicians have quotas to meet as well and more so than not, a tech will tell you there is a wiring problem and tell you that you either need to add a Service Protection Plan (Insurance for your cable lines that runs between $3.95 USD and $4.95 USD per month based on whatever market you're in) to prevent you from having to pay the $39.95 USD technician fee. If you don't want that option, we can then tell you to return the faulty box to a local service center (expect about a two hour wait) to replace the equipment, but if you bring that box home and it doesn't work, guess what? You now have something called a Failed Self Install, and regardless of your protection plan, it will not cost you $39.95 USD to have the tech come out and fix it.\r\n\r\nAssume that I did fix your problem though, but you call back in 4 days later over a billing issue, if you either just hit 0 to talk to someone quickly in hopes of not waiting, you will get routed back to a repair department, if you happen to get video (we have a 7 day window before our FCRs are considered good and we're credited for them), but tell me on the phone that you need to get to billing. Through no fault of your own, other than wanting a rep quickly, you just caused me to get a negative mark on my FCR, simply because you came through on the video queue instead of going through the billing queue. Then, as an added bonus, I'm slapped with a negative transfer rate, because we're not supposed to transfer calls. When you combine just these three of the four metrics that we are required to meet for advancement to level 2 (you're terminated after six months if you've not attained three consecutive months of meeting and exceeding the four primary metrics. UNLESS of course, you have good sales and don't really do anything else. Then they're more than happy to break that rule for you and keep you on the phones with the promise of having you restart the Career Advance Path again for another six months.\r\n\r\nYour shifts are not determined by seniority either. They are determined by sales alone. Those with low sales work the worst shifts, which basically means there is no such thing as ever seeing your family again if you wish to stay employed in a Comcast call center. Also...those metrics have to be met in order for you to even transfer to another department like Com tech, or dispatch.\r\n\r\nONE MORE VERY IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: If you are a Comcast customer reading this and you demand to speak to a supervisor, there are two things you should know. We are required to do our best to prevent that transfer, even if it means telling you that they can't do anything different than we can. We are REQUIRED to de-escalate the call at all costs, even if that means lying to you to do so. Also, if you are one of the lucky ones that gets to a speak to a a supervisor, (this happens generally when someone has had several missed appointments by technicians, which by the way, get cancelled for no reason at all. Sometimes, they're cancelled, strictly because the tech didn't want to do the job that day, or could get something else done more quickly. When they tell you that you will receive a call 30 minutes prior to their arrival, you probably won't, but if they do call and you somehow miss the call, but call them back, they will not answer and they will move on to the next job. Your account will be marked as \"Cust Not Home\"), you're probably not talking to a supervisor. More than likely you just got transferred to a rep just like me who tells you that he's a supervisor and then repeats the exact same thing that I just told you before the transfer. Supervisors do take calls from time to time, but it's only at designated times and only for a limited amount of time. Normally about an hour to an hour and a half. Just know, that if you're asking for a supervisor, more than likely the rep just put you on hold, leaned over to his neighbor (providing that the neighbor is authorized to take those calls) and says \"Hey, can you jump in iChat for a second, they need a supervisor\". Then we'll discuss over the partition everything that I just told you, so he knows what to say to you."}, {"review_title": "A Monet .", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "27 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Training was very active and engaging . \r\nSupervisors had very young souls .", "cons": "Horrible so called \"trainers\" \r\n\r\nUpper management would threaten associates that if they weren't selling they would be let go.\r\n\r\nbilling csr would be pushed to \"sell\" \r\n\r\nCannot escalate any call, if you do then you are punished ."}, {"review_title": "Former Business Account Executive", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Business Account Executive in Castro Valley, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "there is defiantly the possibility make a good paycheck just like another billion dollar company, legal has your back as long as your numbers look good.

I had such high-hopes at the beginning, expecting this to be a company which would want to develop, grow and empower its employees to reach their individual potentials. Sadly, this is not the case. There is no mentoring and there are no career paths. Management does not recognize the talents and gifting of its employees so they are rarely utilized. Everyone sitting in cubicles is under-utilized talent who are capable of so much more, but management is uninterested in encouraging personal development. \r\n\r\nAs for the corporate culture, this took a drastic turn after the purchase of NBC Universal. Prior to purchasing NBCU, there are a fair amount of autonomy at individual locations and business practices had some flexibility to better serve the needs of customers. After purchasing NBCU, Comcast became overtly political and is now a company dominated by cultural relevance. Business practices are now top-down, one-size-fits all. The problem is, NOTHING is one-size-fits all and the customers suffer because of this. As an employee you will be exposed to, overwhelmed with and bullied by all of the cultural \"social justice\" issues of the day. \r\n\r\nWorking at Comcast will not give you a personal sense of worth nor will it give you hope for your future. You will go to work each day and perform some tasks within a functional group however value will not be added to your life. The best you can hope for is to be blessed by a few personal relationships you are able to develop with some of your co-workers. This is what will sustain you. Over the last 4-5 yrs of my career at Comcast, my annual \"performance increases\" were a measly 2%. And I say \"performance increases\" because my annual reviews had nothing to do with my actual performance. Annual salary increases are determined during the annual budgeting process and understand that this company is ALWAYS looking for costs to cut. Costs associated with employees are always the first cuts made. Each year after the budget process is completed in Q3, headcount cuts are made in Q4. I was a witness to this the past 5-8 years.\r\n\r\nIf you seek \"job security\" then you will likely be able to find that at Comcast as long as you have no dreams or career aspirations. If you are someone who wants to make a difference or you want your hard work to be appreciated and rewarded then Comcast is not the place for you.

Depending on the org/manager you are under, you\u2019ll be working 40 hours max per week and can enjoy your life after work and the weekends to do what you want. Working from home is also okay once or twice a week which is great! \n- Benefits and perks are great. Insurance is top notch and out-of-pocket is quite low. 401(k) matching is 6% which is amazing. Cable/internet/home security is heavily discounted and pretty much free\n- Working with some of the brightest minds. Comcast tries it\u2019s best to get some of the best engineers out there and it does show. Some of the people I work with have great ideas and can solve pretty much any problem. It\u2019s great as an engineer still young in my career to take bits and pieces from how these people solve problems and make it my own.\n- Great working conditions (in the Philadelphia campus at least). I love working at the Comcast Center (and moving to the Comcast Technology Center soon). Working in the tallest buildings in the city and getting the amazing views is pretty breathtaking and is a nice distraction when you want a break from your work. There\u2019s also a nice cafeteria that has a lot of options albeit quite expensive. \n- Comcast is quickly becoming a top-tier technology company that\u2019s developing and using some of the latest trends in tech. Comcast encourages their employees to try to incorporate new tools or develop a piece of software if it doesn\u2019t already exist. \n- Even though people are starting to cut cable, Comcast has shifted it\u2019s focus to internet and home automation/IoT and other spaces.

Many people outside of the company still view Comcast as an evil telecom corporation. Telling people I work here can sometimes start a long conversation on how much they hate Comcast. \n- A bit lower salary than other top tier tech companies. Even though Philadelphia cost of living is way lower than Silicon Valley/San Francisco, I wish Comcast paid a bit more base salary, but it\u2019s not that bad. \n- A lot of contractors. Even though many contractors are amazing and super intelligent, a lot of them come in and leave and there is a constant rotation. This can leave gaps in knowledge. I wish Comcast converted more people to FTE that really earned it.\n- Promotions can take a long time depending on the org. Some orgs promote their top performing employees super quickly, others let their employees stagnate in the same role they\u2019re in for years. \n- Things move SUPER slow at times due to how large the company is. To get a firewall request done could take up to a week which can be a little bit frustrating. Getting a new employee (especially contractors) set up with their laptop, desk, etc can sometimes take weeks after they start which is just ridiculous. \n- A lot of reorgs. Recently there has been some shift in upper management (in the Digital Home org) which has led to some changes downstream.

This means you have the name-recognition, funding, and structure of an established and stable company. Structure means there's organization and hierarchy, if that's your thing. That in turn means the Vice President gets the big big picture vision and meets with directors to share. Directors are told the bigger picture goals, who then pass the overall action item to the managers, who then pass to the individual contributors to figure out together how best to implement...and then you implement. If you don't like the idea of hierarchy or bosses (or the possibility for this structure to lead to micromanaging and political sucking up), this might be tricky. Otherwise, this leads to a well-oiled and effective machine that gets work done. \r\n\r\nBecause the Business sector is so new and small, you also have the 500-or-less employee size feel of a smaller company along with the feeling that you reallly do have the creativity and opportunity to flex outside your job responsibilities and dip into other voluntary projects purely for career growth.

Much of the mindset is \"heads down, I'm going to do the minimal work to secure a paycheck, even if it means doing mediocre work.\" This attitude and loose practice of integrity makes the \"customer experience\" push a real dicey one because at the end of the day, many employees are more focused on either making the sales numbers as inflated as possible or about clocking in and clocking out.\r\n\r\nLeaders are often promoted from within due to the \"who you know\" or \"how long you've been here\" versus true managerial knowledge. If you're faced with a leader who doesn't know what she or he is doing and has no true business being a leader of people and of craft...well, can't do anything about that other than watch that person get promoted again in a few years. \r\n\r\nThe company and the overall industry is older, which means slightly old fashioned business practices and ways of management. Expect to play or hear about politics and who knows whom. Inappropriate behaviors and misconduct surrounding the treatments of race, diversity, and gender is a thing here, probably due to the \"old boys\" culture and nature of it being a more old fashioned industry. Cloud content management and digital tools haven't hit yet, so get used to old fashioned collaboration and file sharing practices. Forget about the tech company benefits you hear about at the Facebooks and Googles of Silicon Valley -- there are no snacks, no flexible work from home options, no unlimited PTO, no fitness reimbursements.

Computers track in real time not just for your immediate supervisor but across the call center how long you are on a call with every single customer (if you go over a certain time while helping a customer and your supervisor arbitrarily decides today is the day to crack down on that you will receive an IM about it in real time to get off). Your breaks thus are logged and monitored in real time down to the second. The calls are back-to-back from the time of your first phone call to the last. There are people who do not believe there are such Orwellian jobs or technology yet where an employee's \"productivity\" can be monitored in real time by the second and acted on, but anyone in service-industry type jobs just above the fast-food level or big-box-store level knows this is very much the reality (warehouse employees for online sellers, for example, also are tracked for their productivity from the moment they electronically check in through every single item they scan and package and how many seconds it takes them to reach another bin, etc.). All of this is before you even get to the ridiculous quotas, also monitored and tracked in real time electronically, but many other posters already have hit on that. Your corporate identity is 100 percent numbers 100 percent of the time. But at least it's a job.\r\n\r\nThe single most frustrating thing is that Comcast issues deliberately contradictory pricing information to call center employees and that it provides a single day of training on troubleshooting and resolving issues that 99 percent of customers calling into the call center are trying to resolve (one day out of two months of training is devoted to troubleshooting; the rest is devoted to sales). The contradictory pricing information and constantly changing basic Comcast corporate policies are not just bad communications -- they are deliberate. The contradictory information means that any given customer calling in will get a different answer on pricing from every single person he/she speaks to, and it's totally a crapshoot whether the person seeking help with the service will actually have the issue resolved. The contradictory information often flies in the face of what even the supervisors of the front-line call center employees might have repeatedly said is the policy over the course of a year -- literally overnight front-line call center employees and their supervisors will learn that what they've been doing all along to follow the rules and keep their jobs isn't just a little bit different than what the corporate policy really is but 100 percent the opposite, and a bunch of coworkers in one fell swoop in one day will be fired to underscore the seriousness of their infraction. I don't know why upper management operates in such a way -- there will always be a few longtime devoted great employees caught in the mass firings -- but it almost has to be budgetary (the call center needs to make its own quotas) and arbitrarily overnight changing policies and saying that's been the policy all along allow the company to cite a reason for an abrupt mass firing. The employees really are just endless set of numbers and mathematical calculations on a computer screen. \r\n\r\nSo.

A couple of examples: Customer Service agents have their phone calls monitored for time and count. Supervisors look at these (among other) numbers to determine if employee is meeting the days numbers. No where does it record if problems are actually solved. WAY too often the agents rushes people off the phone without correcting a problem that would have taken them beyond the expected time limit. This infuriates customers as anyone who has Comcast can attest. The agents who take the time to make sure the problems are corrected go over the limit, don't get as many calls completed and, without recourse, get denied a raise.\r\nThe Technicians have it much the same way. A tech is given an average of 60 minutes to go to a house, identify the problem and correct it. Oh yes, and check everything else in the house to make sure the customer does not have to call again for a repeat trouble call. In a new construction home, this is fine. In a 50 year old home with old wires that need replacing, the job could take four hours. Do it right.....no raise. Do it fast, customer calls back and the Tech gets a repeat....no raise.\r\nComcast recently had many long time employees in Customer Care ( many supervisors) have to re-apply for their jobs. Many did not get re-hired. The environment is one that, even most supervisors, feel that every day could be their last. It is an extremely stressful job at every level. A few years ago the numbers guy in our office actually asked the technicians how long it took to walk from their morning meetings to their trucks.

Essentially you become an interactive script and even if you can see in your notes or diagnostics what the customer's issue is, you are not allowed to simply take the proper step to fix it, you must ask the customer irrelevant questions and fill out the ticket. You are no longer able to even send a simple refresh signal to a piece of equipment without \"permission,\" from their line-of-questions system. This system was full of bugs and feedback and bug-reporting were ignored for months at a time, only then to receive a stock reply of \"we are working on it,\" or the ticket being rejected as a \"duplicate,\" but with no resolution. Despite the amount of time you were forced to waste in this system, the metric of how long you can have a customer on the phone for was never adjusted to compensate.\r\n\r\nThe system essentially nullified any need for training as anything you learned in training was no longer useful - you could only say and do what was on your screen. You essentially become an automated system with slightly better voice recognition. I truly believe the overall goal of this is to reduce training costs. Before this system, new agents spent six weeks in training. Comcast call centers have a huge turnover rate, so the cost of training is fairly significant. Eliminating the need for training, even at the cost of a far, far, inferior customer experience seems to be preferable. This will make employees more expendable and help with costs related to the turnover rate. No competent person stays at Comcast long because the pay is not worth the environment and the way you are treated. I think it's very sad Comcast thinks this is a better solution than fixing the things that make people quit and hiring competent people who can troubleshoot effectively without literally being told what to do, step-by-step, real-time.\r\n\r\nWhile paid time off seemed generous, the fact that an unscheduled absence for *any reason,* was considered \"unacceptable,\" offset that significantly. T-Boned on your lunchbreak? Unacceptable; point. Death of a close family member who does not meet their strict criteria of \"immediate?\" Unacceptable; point for any time missed as a result. They give you what they call \"flex-waives,\" which, in reality, are what other companies call \"personal days.\" The difference is they are used as excuses to not waive any absence for any reason beyond those 4 \"flex-waives, regardless of what documentation and you may have and regardless of the situation.\r\n\r\nIt is normal to take the unfavored shift when starting with an employer, but at Comcast, I was stuck with it. 1-Midnight, including weekends. Despite the fact that their was a shift bid 5 months after we started, we were not allowed to participate. My numbers were good and I looked forward to getting a more manageable shift. They were using 3 months of scorecard data to calculate rank. While we had 3 months of data, the range they defined included one month for which we were not on the phone. It would have been very easy to slide that date range to let us participate in the bid. There were a number of ways to let us participate, but they chose not too. Seniority is only 30% of the bid, it is supposed to be based on performance  but despite being a top-performer I was stuck for a year working 1pm-Midnight because it was easier for them logistically.\r\n\r\nBenefits were quite expensive compared to other Fortune 500s and for slightly worse coverage.\r\n\r\nMany promised benefits were not possible to take advantage of. They supposedly have a system where Comcast will pay for certain IT courses and you pay for the testing to get a certificate. This was a key point for me in my interview, and it was glorified during training when they indoctrinate about how amazing Comcast is. For 3 months I tried to coordinate taking advantage of this program, I involved multiple supervisors, a manager, and they worked with HR. Supervisor and manager had never heard of it, I sent screenshots of the company intranet discussing exactly how to take advantage of it, they worked with HR, and nothing ever happened.

Different trainers have different capabilities. some are better than others, so it's the luck of the draw who you get for your 8 weeks of training. There is ultra strict time-keeping... in training we learned the penalties for being even a minute late. Everything needs to be clocked, even going to the restroom. Plus the calls get monitored secretly, so you never know when you're being evaluated. There were hires that seemed to lack education, and their grammar in speaking was not good. This was surprising to me. As a customer, when I call into a call center, when a person can't use the English language appropriately, I'm uncomfortable with their degree of expertise about the product. The training facility rooms need improvement. Broken chairs that squeek LOUDLY every time you move, slow computers, only one screen to learn on when in fact the whole job relies on 2 computer screens. A lot of time is lost going back and forth between programs during training, losing information and time continually, adding to the stress and frustration. One trainer seemed much better than the one I had... I wasn't able to learn well with the trainer I was assigned. The whole training and job itself is very very regimented, so a person will have to learn to be compulsive in that way. I decided not to stay with the company eventually, because my strengths were not used working in a call center on the phone. My experience and past success has to do with person to person inter-action in real life, and so I can understand why the pay and earnings are better than average. It's a job that not everyone wants to do.

But then sadly no more ever again.", "cons": "My original job with Comcast was outsourced, and my and many other people's positions were eliminated. We were told we had 1 year to get back into the company and still maintain our standing with the company. My last day was august 17th 2017, and i was hired back in on October 15th 2017. My medical benefits did not automatically turn back on like i was told by HR they should. I spent 3 months being ignored by HRSS on getting my medical benefits reinstated. Big mess up on them having me in the system as a \"new hire\" which wasn't the case. The fact i was ignored for 3 months was the biggest of that issue. It was December 29th when they finally contacted me to tell me they messed up. I had been contacting them weekly since being rehired. \r\n\r\n I also expected the yearly merit raise when March 2018 rolled around, based on the 10 months I worked in 2017. But found out that because I was forcedly \"displaced\" for 8 weeks, it made me ineligible for a raise. How convenient for Comcast. This makes me furious, disappointed, discouraged, feeling unvalued and financially struggling currently with the lack of over time options at my new job and a $210/mo. rent hike. \r\n* Shame on you Comcast. I worked my butt off for 10/12 months in 2017, I worked harder than many, and I cared more than most. I'm one of the great employees this company prides itself on having, and they use a lousy loop whole to not honor my yearly raise? I did not LEAVE, I was forced out so they could save $$ by sending the jobs to another company who\u2019ll do it cheaper.  I'll be honest, that alone makes me care a whole lot less, and why should I care for a company that doesn't care for me? Their excuse was \"you were not with the company for those 8 weeks. My counter was \"but what about the 8 months leading up to that? That effort should have been acknowledged.  And the 2 months after it when I re-hired? None of that is counted? My 8 months of back breaking labor doesn't matter to them. And their excuse for the 2 months after was \"new hires that start in October are not eligible for a merit raise\" ... Yes, I am aware of this. It is true because they are within a 90 day new hire trial period, so no they wouldn't get a merit raise for that calendar year. BUT I'M NOT A NEW HIRE! I\u2019m a rehire, and I did work during the calendar year and I was NOT in a 90 trial period. How convenient you relabeled me just in this regard so as to not have to give me my well DESERVED and most certainly earned raise.  Screwed me over is what you did. I'm sure all your employees with poor work ethic still got their raise. I owe the company at least 10 months of lack of effort, but it\u2019s not my way, I just have too good of work ethic. I just need to be with a company that truly honors that and wants to retain the good employees. My raises have been anywhere from 4%-6.5%, (5% being the max we were told) I\u2019m really that great of a worker. My entire management team gave me glowing letters of recommendation because they wanted to make sure the company retained me. And then the company slaps me in the face, again.  What would a lousy minimum 2% for me have cost them really? I would have taken that over nothing. SHAME SHAME SHAME on Comcast. \r\nThey offer poor chiropractic care in their medical package. Comcast is filled with people doing heavy lifting, bending, twisting, back hurting jobs, whether a tech, a warehouse employee, or someone sitting at a desk for 8 hours, real chiro care would be great but sadly we only get 12 visits. If you are unlucky enough to have to use any of those visits before you hit deductible you'll  be paying about $45 a visit, and then after you use up 12.. You\u2019ll be paying $45 a visit\u2026 So try to hit deductible before you need chiro-care.  \r\nAnother con is, sometimes management doesn't want to deal with, handle, manage, the troublemaker employees. Maybe they are scared to? But sometimes some management will make a martyr out of a good employee because they don't want to reprimand a bad one. It's sad, I\u2019ve seen it a lot unfortunately. \r\nIn the office setting there is a very clich\u00e9 \"clique\" scene. I came from warehouse, and get some grief for having not been with in this building before getting hired in this position. As if I am any less capable of doing this job. And honestly, I do it better already than some of the old timers here who have gotten to the point of laziness and lack of care. \r\nAfter your 5th year you will not receive any more extra vacation time. Sad, I know lots of people who've been here for 20 years and get nothing for it, not even a real raise because they are \"capped\" I think they get a onetime bonus each year for time served. \r\nSpeaking bonuses, they gave us all $1000 bonus after they got a HUGE tax break from Trump. That bonus was taxed so hard, that the government still got theirs, and Comcast got to save on theirs, and i didn't get a raise, and that lousy $450 bucks was pointless and did NOTHING to help the employees or the economy in which we live. Thanks for nothing on that front. Didn't even cover half of rent. \r\n\r\nMost of the places won't let you use your flex time as needed. It's your time and you get punished constantly for having to use it, Vacation should be scheduled, Flex should be able to use freely *within reason*. We fought for that at the warehouse and got it but now my new position is a big NOPE. All my work is finished for the day, even if there is plenty of coverage and we're all twiddling our thumbs, if you have to leave early, you're getting punished. Forget to log into the phone after lunch, get punished. Come in 3 minutes late, punished. I could have just gone to Tim Hortons, grabbed breakfast, been 2.5 hours late, and had the same punishment. I'll remember that next time if traffic is stupid and I\u2019m not going to make it within that 1 minute 59 second grace period. \r\nIt doesn't matter if you work through my breaks, I stay late if its needed,  go above and beyond, get all of your work done, help others theirs done, you get punished right and left for using flex time, OUR TIME, without a 24 hour notice. Heck, I came into work and at 9am I asked to take the next day off because something came up last minute, (my shift starts at 8:30 mind you) the 23.5 hour notice wasn't a 24 hour notice.. I got punished. I needed to take a weekend off, but felt bad because of the already light coverage and didn't want the other ladies to be swamped, so I chose to come in for a couple hours anyways to help out. Had an issue in the morning, got there late, stayed later to make sure all the things were done, and got punished. Next time I\u2019ll just take the whole day and not try to be nice. It only bit me in the behind in the long run. This is definitely getting old.\r\nI'm giving Career Opportunities a 1 star, because you could be perfectly qualified for a job and get denied without reason, and then the job will go back up on the board as open. Come to find out, I have been told multiple times \u201cwe don\u2019t hire outside the building, you are a rare case\u201d Why don\u2019t you hire outside the building? Is this how all the establishments with in Comcast operate? How do we move up if all you see is Warehouse, or Driver and immediately assume we\u2019re too stupid or unskilled. I\u2019ve seen it happen too many, they get stuck in these entry level positions and it actually HURTS them. You think you are getting a foot in the door, but really you are getting stuck in the room. \r\nThe ONLY reason I was even considered was because of being a great employee, and the right connection seeing it firsthand put a word in for me. They have this mentality of \u201cif you didn\u2019t start in this office there\u2019s no way you could do this job\u201d. Let\u2019s be clear, this job is EASY. At least for myself it is, I see people who\u2019ve been here for 20 years struggle with concepts or not catch on as fast to new content as I have. I have BFA, I am computer/tech savvy, I can learn any new software or program within a week or 2. I have common sense, and logic. I have experience in this kind of work. I\u2019m smart, motivated, self-managed, and a shining example of good work ethic.  But I was almost not even given the time of day because I wasn\u2019t with in this building?

There is a tendency to do work for the sake of staying busy, and not to actually accomplish anything. A lot of groups are protective of their own processes/work and resistant to potentially positive changes. \r\n\r\nManagement tends to treat every single project as the most critical which ultimately leads to a lack of trust - especially when internal products or project results are dropped within weeks of completion. Personally I have just completed my third project in a row where the finished product has gone ignored by the same stakeholders who were stating how vital the project was for the company's success. \r\n\r\nThere is an overall lack of accountability when it comes to project success.  Projects can slip in terms of budget and timeline by several months and hundreds of thousands of dollars and sponsors or project managers will simply move the goal posts. Very rare to have any revisiting of projects a year+ later to see if the business case has panned out or if returns have been met. No sense of lessons learned and mistakes are very often repeated. \r\n\r\nBe careful about promises of internal movement/promotion, especially across functions. Its possible to be able to advance through job openings on other teams, but it will be entirely on you to find these and pursue them. There is no sense in the broader company of an internal talent marketplace and often managers will look outside first - in my opinion this is due to lack of support from the talent acquisition teams. The Career Profile was advertised as a solution to this, but I have yet to hear about a success story where an individual was contacted by other groups within the company for opportunities or to work on new projects, or of any manager who used this tool when making a hiring decision. Your own resume, LinkedIn profile, and networking will do a lot more for your internal career growth than the Career Profile will."}, {"review_title": "A job for true overachievers who can tolerate a lot of processes and installation challenges", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Enterprise Account Executive in Lynnwood, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The Enterprise product suite is of high quality.

A high quota and ever decreasing average deal size adds challenge and stress to meeting goals.  Selling involves a high amount of documentation and tedious steps to process a sale and therefore may not be a fit for candidates who dislike spreadsheets and micro management.  The company develops agent /indirect partners and hires inside sales reps that directly compete with the EAE for the same customers / sales.  Your territory is not really your territory.  They move your customers away from you to an account manager after 12 months.  So, you often only get a small piece of the customer's potential sales before it becomes someone else's benefit to reap what you sewed.   It is not true Enterprise, nor even mid market very often.  70% of sales are single location Internet and voice service.  They claw back commissions if a customer does not get installed and it happens semi-frequently due to construction delays and less ideal performance by a constructiin or project management partner.  The sales rep incurs 100% of the risk but has little control over outcome.  The company routinely makes changes to processes designed to help a different department, like operations, but adds new burdens on sales people and negatively impacts customer experience.  Comcast Business does not sell globally, therefore it is not addressing a large potential customer segment which limits your potential sales.   Incentives and salary compensation are about 40% lower than current market price for a similar role in other technology companies.

The metrics you have to meet to move up have become very high as well plus your supervisor has to like you enough to feel you are ready to move up. They are still in the business of rushing their technicians to make time frames and have high production with \"good\" quality which leads to a lot of skipped breaks and sometimes even a half lunch if we get one at all. If you do work there, gain the favor of the boss and just mimic what they do if they were a technician even if it is not with the best interest of the customer. Its about finishing out jobs quickly here, not so much customer satisfaction.You don't have days off as well since if someone calls in on you for whatever reason, even if not cable related, you get a bad mark on your metrics therefore making it harder for you to move up. They claim they do not count it against you, if it is not workmanship, but they do. This makes it harder for you to make your metrics and in turn harder to get paid more. When you reach your higher amount of money as a technician you have to befriend management to keep your job long enough to get fired before retirement which I have seen them do to older technicians. Tech's are just numbers to them, literally. We have technician numbers with metrics beside them. The technicians that I have heard of that did that were actually good were let go for whatever reason they may have seen fit. Good tech's, good people. Just not up to the speed of what the company wanted. If you look up Comcast under Forbes, they are the worst known for customer satisfaction in 2014 and being a tech there, I can see why unfortunately. Everyone in the middle are less stressed, but underpaid for the work they do so if they are ok with the smaller pay then it is a little more stressful than the worst or the best technicians. Management looks at the poor customer satisfaction and lack of quality work done on the first visit as \"job security\". Not really customer driven at all unless a customer complains, especially on You Tube. I only stay here because the money is good enough, but the customer loyalty and the opportunity for growth for good tech's are lacking.

More competition is on the horizon, however Comcast is often a step ahead.", "cons": "Appearance of function is often more important than actual function, both internally and externally.  Statistics are fairly easily manipulated if you know how.\r\n\r\nToo often localized management displays rather short term business behaviors in trying to shine for upper local or centralized senior corporate leadership (Philly). Those in higher positions of power often have little idea of how things really work locally and on the front line, but think they do and those under them are often either ignorant themselves or simply to scared to correct them, resulting in the implementation of negatively impacting policies as a result. Even if local or senior leadership do confer with local or front line employees they rarely listen and typically move forward with their ideas, or those of their superiors, regardless. It's hard to say if this is out of arrogance or a mistrust that the employees aren't being honest with them. Speaking up about such issues is often ignored outright or can result in someone being labeled a bad employee, even so far as being targeted to get rid of (and HR will often not have your back in such a case since it's that persons superiors who have their ear).\r\n\r\nInternal policy often drives negative employee behavior. Front line employees are often given conflicting goals. For example, in tech support our employee reviews are negatively impacted if we send a technician to a customers home as compared to correcting the issue over the phone, providing us with a reason to not help customers that need in-person support requiring a truck roll.  Tech support reps often find ways to get the customer to call back rather than schedule an in-person service call in order to pass the known needed truck roll on to another tech support agent.  This is one of the various reasons customers have to call multiple times to get the help they need.\r\n\r\nOutsourcing aspects of the service, sometimes even internal support, is causing problems that are being ignored too long for the sake of saving money on paper or, if money is actually being saved, it's only in the short term. Customer service suffers for the sake of saving a little money and in the long run money will be lost due to bad customer service.  With the increase in cell phone usage and the advent of internet based entertainment this will become a bigger liability in the near future.\r\n\r\nBenefits, while still good, have been getting reduced over the years. Higher end medical plan options have repeatedly been done away with over the years and 401k match dropped a several years back. Yet Comcast makes higher (record) profits every single year. Perhaps this is why?\r\n\r\nYou need to be a Yes-Man in order to move up. Even if your criticisms are legitimate there's rarely any point to voicing them. While middle management is somewhat to blame for this it can be argued the reason they don't try is because they are often stuck in the same situation with their local superiors. In most chains of command at Comcast you'll often run into someone who is afraid to rock the boat for the greater good of the company due to the fear of drawing attention to the fact that things aren't quite as rosy as people been painting them to be. As a result you will likely draw the, often silent, ire of your superiors by speaking up.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, for one of the worlds largest communications companies in the world, Comcast needs to update their measuring stick for how the company is gauged.  Television subscribers are still largely considered the primary focus, yet other services are more profitable.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, none of this is all that unusual in a corporation as large as Comcast, however the problems seem more magnified at Comcast based on my knowledge of other companies."}, {"review_title": "Finally, a Company that Values it's Employees!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Jun 2016", "job_title": "Staff Accountant in Oaks, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work / life balance, amazing benefits Package, management genuinely cares about employees and their personal & professional growth, a lot of educational / mentorship opportunities.

Even if a call goes well and the customer is satisfied but later calls back because they had an unrelated question or simply wanted to make a payment etc this too will count as a negative as it is considered a repeat call.

Certain things that are out of your control you take a hit for it and are just told to OWN IT! Recently Comcast has made a decision to convert their system over to CSG database which has caused a huge headache for many agents across the country because not only were we poorly trained on the new system but the system was flawed during its release which caused customers accounts to screwed up but we could not fix the accounts because we did not have the tools to fix the job. So we were simply told to lie to the customer to get them off the phone and write down the account and hope that you remember to fix that one account after handling over 40 accounts a day 5 - 6 days a week if you worked OT or not. Vacation, flex, floating, and sick days are okay but if you are working in the call center with this high level stress you are going to use them up faster than you got them. And if you live in an area where the weather does potentially get bad around the winter season you are advised to save your flex just for those days which is unrealistic because sometimes you do need to take some time off just to recoup from all the negative energy you encounter with the customers over the phone.

Management is a joke in some departments. To get a manager to take a escalated call is like pulling teeth at times. I went through multiple management changes in the almost 5 years I worked there. I have a few good managers and a few managers that I wanted to escalate every call I was on just to make her life difficult on purpose. The ability to grow in the company was extremely limited. You had to be either exceptional at your job or know someone to get promotions. The customers wear you down and down and down. You will get called names, cursed at, yelled at. They expect the worst customer service because that is what Comcast is known for but when you try to turn around their perceptions and over come their roadblocks it's like pulling teeth. So when it comes to call quality and their cqe's (listening to your call and getting reviewed by it) it feels almost impossible to meet all the expectations. Training is a JOKE! Yes, the initial training is good but once your on the floor trying to keep up with everything feels impossible so sometimes your calls take longer than they should because you're digging through information making sure that this customer is eligible or that the information you know is correct. When I was there every few months they would announce they would set aside training hours but then never would follow through. The mandatory overtime wears you down, an 8 hour shift getting turned into 9 or a 10 into 11 wouldn't seem like much but it can add up. There is really no significant raises after you're hired. It's based on your performance but I believe the cap is .30 cents. You are somewhat micromanaged if you aren't meeting goals in what ever they are pushing you can get into trouble pretty quickly. Coaching is non existent though. Managers will be the first to pipe up if you're doing something wrong but rather than give helpful hints or anything to help you grow they kinda leave it at that. I worked there for quite some time and I didn't meet my sales goal ONCE and my manager had the audacity to say to me why are we hiring you if you can't do the job.

Good hours with shift options.", "cons": "1) training was a night mare. Not because the the knowledge base was not there but the changed where they were going to place us, not once but 3 times in the 2 week training period. Some of the possible options I had no experience in but that didn't seem to matter. In the end it came full circle to the orginal area we interviewed for, all that stress and confession for nothing.\r\n2) transition was unorganized when walked to the floor still not knowing who our supervisor was, no one even knew where we where expected to sit. When finnally sat several times it was decided that it was a mistake. This went in for the entire week. Some of us left behind if the team was moved on their day off, finding no where to sit upon their return. This lead to us spread out randomly throughout the floor, not getting the help or attention needed as a new hire. This continued untill our supervisor was decided and moved to our finnal team.\r\n3) management and employees have a huge disconnect supervisor teach change in service to wow the customer, to better their reputation. Their rating is in the negative below zero rating among customers, they hired an outside company with a multi year plan to change it, spending millions in training, marketing, and branding.  I give them major props for this and there are some success and changes being made. Employees voice is being heard on some levels with positive results.  But supervisors don't hold themselves to what they teach, example- the policy told to employees is if customers asks to speak to your manager to tell customer it will be 24-48 hrs for a return call. You then email the info to your supervisor. It's common knowledge if asked supvisors do not return customers calls. That customer will call in again and justifiedly so  very upset and angry. Even more frustrating is when the agent gets scored by customer in s survey they get marked down for something prior out of their control. In a defense supervisors appear very over worked, always off floor away from their teams in meetings. They have no assistance with time consuming tasks that are not sensitive in nature, other call centers I worked have a team lead to do these tasks and assist with coaching, and driving the team. The supervisors need the tools to manage their time better, and get on board with what they teach to better the company.\r\n4) supervisors are not in touch with how to handle HR issues or proper technical conversation of OSHA privacy. What can and can not be said or asked.  I have experience myself or seen. \r\n\r\nA supervisor  tell an employee that the supervisor had a family member who is a nurse, they said the illness was not serious. Not sure why they needed leave.\r\n\r\nI employee returning from leave without a activated badge or system access, the supervisor told employee that those were not his job, proceeded to do nothing to assist.\r\n\r\nSeen myself many employees and I myself have experienced problems with Sidwyck, the company who handles many of our leave benefits. They are flat a horrid company making many mistakes, then will deny you for their mistakes. Lost faxes , changed policies midway, short time frames even with their mistakes. It seems they are hired to protect Comcast bottom line, not as a benefit. Comcast to my knowledge has never investigated the claims or even questioned why employee's have so many problem. Supervisors do nothing to assist. Many employees seem to get lost and either quit or get fired on a tectinal issue I believe probably no fault of theirs, either way they are gone.\r\n\r\nI was once coached  once just weeks out of training the entire session was spent showing me how much money I cost the supervisor pay check. If I had performed at the same level as the rest of team he would of made $x.xx but I dropped him to $x.xx . Then proceeded to explain how had he could get me fired. To forget HR and time lines. He would write me up everyday  1-2-3 strikes your out, gone in a week. He gave me a month, but in two weeks I was moved to another floor and department. He told me he was doing me a favor.  Sups would talk loud in front of employee how they wish they could trade you for another...

Programs and APPs to do you're day to day job go down daily making incredibly difficult to do your job. Sales staff steal commisions from technicians as well as making promises technicians can't keep that's if they just don't flat out lie to customers. Comcast says technicians are the most important part of the company but every other sales position or call center position has a higher starting wage and the metrics aren't nearly as difficult to make. Also upon hiring Comcast will tell you you're shift as a technician will at a certain time and that's not true. Technicians work until all the appointments have been met.

The communication level of this company is laughable.  I get at least a few calls a week from customers asking about a new product or promotion that they've seen commercials about or received a mailer about that none of us in the call center has even heard of.  The front-line representatives always seem to be the last to know about many things in this company.  Just a day or two ago, a couple of co-workers of mine and I were getting calls about one of the service centers being boarded up... none of us had any idea what was going on or why the store was closed.  A FULL day later, we get a hastily put together e-mail stating that the store was closed for business... then a day after that another email was sent with the date that the store would be reopening.  Really?  What am I supposed to tell my customer?  Make something up so that I can get them off of the phone within the 6 minutes we're allotted for each call before our \"numbers\" are affected?\r\n\r\nThe expectations and goals set by the higher-ups are ridiculous... and the crazy thing is that they wouldn't be completely ridiculous if we were provided with the correct tools to handle our customers.  But instead, Comcast just drops their front-line employees in a rowboat with no paddles, in the middle of the ocean.  We don't even have estimated time of resolution 98% of the time when an outage occurs.  And what takes the cake... in the past year or so, someone came up with the great idea of adding customer surveys that call the customer back after ending the call.. and these surveys make up part of the scorecard that grades your overall performance.  In theory, this would be a good idea... but when you don't provide your employees with the correct tools to assist your customers, it's a recipe for disaster.  Most of the people choose ratings on the survey based on how upset they are with Comcast.. not because their interaction with the representative was unsatisfactory.  But that doesn't matter... your score is in the toilet because Comcast can't get their act together.\r\n\r\nSupervisors don't want to take calls when a customer requests to speak with a supervisor... instead they halfway listen to you explain what the issue is and then tell you what to say to the customer.  WHAT?  You can only imagine the position this puts the representative in... you already have someone on the phone who no longer wants to speak with you, but NOW.. you have the audacity to not honor their simple request... and keep feeding them BS.  And don't DARE get sick without planning it 2 months in advance... every unplanned absence gets a write up.. whether you just didn't feel like coming in or you're in a car crash.

I was enthusiastic and proactive in my daily activities. My team was impressed with my ability to handle many high stakes projects with ease and often I was told as much. I was the guy that the junior level designers came to for tips and tricks. The bully was the designer who had been there the longest and had the most to lose from my rapid growth in hindsight. When it came time to promote said bully I was supportive because I had always been impressed by his competencies. Once he was promoted he began to treat myself and another team member like rivals. The time came for me to lead another high stakes project and this time with a few other team members made up of an junior level designer, the bully and the bully\u2019s intern. Yes, the bully had an intern that he not only hired but enlisted to bully me too. I was very excited for this opportunity to lead a team of designers at Comcast as it was a great growth opportunity. The bully undermined me almost everyday, even going as far as taking my team to another room in the building to generate concepts for my project without inviting me. My boss and the bully were buddies. So when I brought up my concerns my boss didn\u2019t give any importance to my claims. I confronted the bully and tried to clear the air in hopes that we could work better together. I was very diplomatic and felt upon leaving that discussion that progress was made. But the bully later sent me an email on a Sunday without CC\u2019ing my boss saying he was going to remove me from presenting a project and would do the presentation to the executive himself and that I would not be speaking, without any grounds to do so. I immediately forwarded the email to my boss asking for guidance. I really didn\u2019t know what to do, I just wanted this to stop, because I enjoyed my job and wanted to get back to that. There was a study from 2012 that concluded that once you are a target of a workplace bully, you are 77.7% likely to be terminated or quit. Well I was terminated and one of my team members that was bullied too quit shortly after citing the bully as the reason. I was a Senior level Designer and my team member that quit was a Lead level designer. I carried about 40-45% of the teams total work load and the Lead Designer carried about 10-15%. Losing us decreased the capacity of that team to deliver that amount of productivity because of this bully. Before I started there we two other similar level designers on this team and I can only imagine that they may have really left for similar reasons.

In all the companies I have worked for not one of them offers paid time off for when you are sick without it ALWAYS taking away from your Vacation time, and few have offered two weeks vacation in your first year. Comcast does not penalize you for having multiple children, no matter how many kids you have your insurance remains the same. People tend to get angry because they use all their flex (sick) time for pleasure and then get written up because they actually get sick and have no time left. I personally have needed to call out with zero notice twice since I've been with the company, and in neither case have I been written up. I think that the policy of calling out once in any rolling 30 days is completely rational, and of course if you don't agree with it you're tied to no contract so pack your desk and get out. Be greatful you have a job, you weren't guaranteed today, wake up glad you've got at least a few breaths left and take the call, that all be it miserable, is your call; look at the bright side you're getting complained to, or about, but knowing you did your best should be enough to satisfy you. Is it frustrating at times to work here, sure, but they call it work for a reason, I don't look at my wife and say \"I'm off to fun sweetheart,\" I say I'm off to work. So to wrap it up I'll say this is the job at times miserable, absolutely, but the main catalyst of this misery is employees that refuse to recognize a good thing when they have it. Comcast offers a great tuition reimbursment program, haven't seen much about that, two weeks PAID vacation in your first year, 8 PAID flex/sick days, and people complain, why, well simply put it's because they can't get their priorities straight.

Comcast is no-nonsense: they intend to make money and see that the employees share in the rewards to a reasonable degree. Best quality is it has risen rapidly enough that it still has a small-company, family-business mind-set even though it has mushroomed into a giant corporation.  Brian Roberts, son of legendary founder, Ralph Roberts, runs it, and his top man is Steve Burke. Both are superb leaders and businessmen. Their business philosophy has been company decentralization, with the various systems and regional divisions across the country left to figure out their own approach  to a significant degree. This has slowed down bureaucratization and sameness, and has fostered  a relative of diversity styles and approaches. The benefit for the employee is a relative lack of stifling generalities rolling mindlessly down from a peak populated by a bland egocentric corporate kingpin.

They do this,presumably, so their managers, in turn, can carry out the things the people they report task them with. The people most out of touch with reality in this arrangement are at the top, while those most in touch are at the bottom. The hierarchy is structured to ensure everyone from the top down focuses on the needs and imperatives of the person above him. Thus, the management ensure that its needs are placed ahead of those of the customers. (Comcast may not be alone in this faulty deployment of resources.)\r\n\r\n Comcast does not realize it has decimated its supervisory core with this ineffective from-the-top-down management strategy. It wonders why it continues to have difficulties with customer satisfaction, when it has much to do with the fact that the employees are not supervised. The supervisors are all away at meetings, learning more and more about managing.
