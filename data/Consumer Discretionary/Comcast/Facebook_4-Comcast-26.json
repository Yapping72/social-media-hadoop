It's such a big company that the left arm does not know what the right arm is doing. No matter what project you are working on, someone else somewhere in Comcast is working on a similar task, so you always end up competing internally against another group. There are always internal feuds going on throughout all levels of management with different branches of the organization fighting for control. Major re-orgs happen once a year, which only adds to the chaos.\r\nNo matter what you may think, Comcast is not a software company, and not even an engineering company. They are an operations company first and foremost. This trait is something you see throughout the cable industry because most people who work there came from support and operations and have little to no experience with engineering, architecture, and software projects. Because of the operations mentality the company has a very rigid culture of blame and shifting responsibility. When there is a problem, the first question is always not \"how do we fix it?\" but rather \"who can we blame for this?\" Additionally, because they are an operations-minded shop everyone is very resistive to change and it usually takes weeks to agree on anything or get anything done. Much of the management at this company make your average DBA look like a risk-taker.\r\nThe pay was crap, but I also know people who made good money there. The one common thing was that once you accept a job you don't get good raises or promotions, other than nominal title changes, and even those are hard to come by. So if you take a job make sure you ask for good money upfront and don't believe any promises of them \"taking care of you next year.\""}, {"review_title": "Unethical Wasteland", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Jan 2014", "job_title": "Technician in Indianapolis, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get paid eventually but always on time", "cons": "Constantly lying to customers, employee deceive, technicians are lazy, can over charge due to monopoly over other companies."}, {"review_title": "Most of it was pretty good, but they tend to be inflexible when it comes to rules/guidelines.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "31 Jan 2014", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Malden, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people who work there are great.

The most common deceptions used by outsourcers are \"Try it free for 30 days and if  you dont like it you can go back to your previous promotion\" and their previous package will be alot less money so since Retention is commission based as well we cant return them to their previous promotion without hurting our numbers and our own paychecks. The second most common deception used by outsourcers and sales agents is that they will tell customers \"Oh the package is $99.99 with everything\" but they wont tell them that on top of that theres a $10 modem rental fee, each additional tv box is $9.95, HD is an extra $10, DVR is an extra $10, and taxes are extra and guess who has to fix the mess when the customer gets their bill? retention department. \r\n\r\n- By the time the customer gets to speak to the retention department they already spoke to at least 2-3 other departments who couldnt help them and each time they were screened by previous agents for adding more lines of business then handed off to another department like a hot potato if they cant get any sale from the customer which causes frustration and angry customers by the time they finally get to retention.\r\n\r\n- To add a little more to my previous comment, retention agents are also responsible for adding lines of business but the customer is screened by previous agents that they spoke to before getting to retention to see if they can get any line of business sales from the customer so only the customers that they couldnt get a sale from get transferred to retention and retention then has to try to upsell those customers or give them the smallest discount possible if they dont want to add a line of business or disconnect them.\r\n\r\n- Many agents refuse to help a customer at all if their account has Xfinity Home (home security) because they dont understand the product enough to help the customer so they usually just transfer them to Xfinity Home Retention even if all they needed was help with billing questions or if they wanted to make changes to their other services that werent home security.\r\n\r\n- Retention is seen by other departments as the dumping ground to resolve customer issues even when a call isnt really a retention call, ive gotten billing agents that transfer accounts that are already disconnected (how is that a retention call?) to place some credits on the customers accounts because of billing errors but that waste my time because we only get commission on calls where the account is still active so thats time spent that you could be helping someone else who has an active account with the company.\r\n\r\n- When an outsource agent or sales agent adds a line of business that the customer didnt want or ask for to their account the retention agent is responsible for removing that line of business but if the customer never agreed to add the service or was never informed that the agent was adding that service to their account how is that fair to the customer and the retention agent who takes a hit on their numbers? the most common cases right now are agents adding home phone or the cheapest home alarm package ($20 a month) via self install kit and the customer calls when they receive the equipment in the mail to ask why they received the equipment for a service that they werent aware they were getting then its the retention agents job to sell the value of the product that they never asked for or take a hit for the service and remove it from the account.\r\n\r\n- Retention agents have to deal with sneaky people within the company sabotaging their retention efforts in order to get a sale for example its often the case where a sales person will create a new account in the new address where a customer moved to but that same sales person will then transfer the customer to retention department to disconnect the account at the previous address and not tell the retention agent that they created another account for the customer, the correct process is for the agent to transfer the account from the old address to the new one and disconnect the old account before connecting the new one but sometimes they dont disconnect the old account so that they dont have to spend more time with the customer on the line. This can affect the retention agents numbers because since the sales person didnt do their job properly if you dont know that the customer has two accounts you will disconnect an account that someone else was suposed to disconnect hurting your numbers. \r\n\r\n- Sometimes sales agents will collaborate with customers telling them that they should disconnect their account and then speak to them to create an account under their spouses name to get a new customer promotion so that they can get a sale which is unethical because their manipulating the system for personal gain at the expense of the company and other employees."}, {"review_title": "Not what it was three years ago, The management had your back.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Oct 2015", "job_title": "CAE Repair in Lynnwood, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "benefits, Plenty of over time as everyone leaves.", "cons": "No respect for longevity.

If you want to be home at a reasonable time each night, this is not the place for you.  If you have little ones at home that go to bed early, forget seeing them because you will be at work if you are doing it all by the numbers.  If you are single or don't have a family to worry about spending time with, go for it, but if you value seeing your family at all during the week, it may not be the place for you.\r\n\r\nThey offer over 5500$ per year in tuition reimbursement but how do you go to college if you never know when you will be out of work.  Kind of tough to schedule classes around that.  \r\n\r\nBig disconnect between what is taught in training and what goes on in the field.  Almost everything they told us not to do in training is being done in the field so that people can try to get off somewhere near on time.  Also, they spend a lot of time in training telling us how to smile , tuck our shirts in and things like that, but some portions of training were way to short.  Internet installs are a big part of the job but we get about 2 days of training on that.  Not nearly enough.   But they will spend days on how to smile, approach the customer, wear our hard hats, and alot of other things that don't require so much.  They need to prioritize the training time more with the technology end before we are sent into field training."}, {"review_title": "Typical Call Center Tech Support Role", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Feb 2011", "job_title": "Technical Support Representative II in Horsham, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.
