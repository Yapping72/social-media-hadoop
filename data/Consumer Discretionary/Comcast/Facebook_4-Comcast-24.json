This way you don't sit there for 10min before everything ready or like very often happens, you forget to open one of them & realize only when talking to a customers which takes another few minutes. I was blown away how such size \"monopoly\" company can have software older than some of its employees using it. Never seen anything like it, you would think they invest money to fix it, this way calls would shorten by 30%, fewer customers in Q or even better save $ since you would need fewer employees.\r\n- You get 30min for lunch just like another 50 people. If you bring something that needs use of microwave forget about it, 3 microwaves for such head count will take 35min before you sit down with your meal. 1min late & system flags you. There is option to order food from outside food cook who runs little sandwich / cheesecake / salad business in the lunchroom with crazy prices. So get used to wending machine or will end up eating while at your desk like most.\r\n- Some Tech Support team supervisors have ABSOLUTELY no IT experience, it was jaw dropping at first, but later you get used to stuffing like that.\r\n- You are a number, NOTHING more. Which is very expect able from such company in size facility. It's like conveyor belt, one training class hits the floor next day you see new class forming and cycle repeats non-stop. It's due to very small % staying for longer then 6 months. Some people come with hopes without knowing how such companies operate. They don't care about you personally (which is perfectly normal) and after seeing how everything works you won't care about them, you are a number to them, and they are a paycheck to you. Most people get better offers while there and quit, others get let go due to low results. It's business.\r\n- Management / Supervisors usually more scared then cubicle people. They know their success depends on their team (too bad team don't realize that) and due to lack of knowledge of the IT itself, the most they lack is leadership, people skills. So they end up sitting and praying for team to pass the metrics so the bigger guy won't come to have a conversation. \r\n- Apart just a gray cubicle desk job the whole feel of the surroundings is horrible, the tension so high, you can literally see the fear in peoples eyes which blown me away. The fake smiles (for 0.5 second) from upper management, the HR's question \"how are you\" which never follows with name since they have no idea is just a recipe 8 hours of horrible time for employees who already not making much in those gray cubicles..."}, {"review_title": "I enjoyed my time there", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Customer Service Associate in New Brunswick, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Comcast gives their employees their services for free", "cons": "I worked the afternoon shift and got home after 10:00 pm"}, {"review_title": "Crappy Management, low pay, good benefits", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Residential Technician in Indianapolis, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get some good benefits", "cons": "Management and the metric system they use to grade the technicians is extremely poor"}, {"review_title": "Good career choices", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Jun 2021", "job_title": "CT5 in Concord, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Many career path options available", "cons": "Local management quality varies wildly, support for some roles are not very supported"}, {"review_title": "Comcast", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "17 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Design Engineer in Newark, DE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits \r\nCourtesy services\r\nNice work environment \r\nCurrently able to work remotely", "cons": "Unfair pay practices\r\nCommute\r\nSenior management has a difficult time establishing set guidelines without constantly changing them."}], [{"review_title": "Great Work Life Balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "26 May 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Mount Laurel, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.
