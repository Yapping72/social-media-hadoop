If you have the drive and ambition, there are a ton of ways in which you can grow into a leader if that's what you want to be. I took advantage of the continued education benefit and am finishing my masters degree now... I also joined a couple of the employee resource groups which offer seminars and networking events that support your professional profile. Listen, I'm not a total nerd. The point of my post is that this isn't a company you join and just stay stale within. They encourage your growth, but it's up to you to make it happen. Not only this - it's pretty exciting. We're busy and we have big jobs to do. My salary is in the top percentile for my industry but not only this, I again get the continued education (which is ~$6K/year) plus free cable/internet, top health care benefits and a truly balanced lifestyle - which is rarely the case within the Tech industry.", "cons": "Telling people you work at Comcast triggers 2 typical responses: 1) A big hatred rant on customer service 2) A how do I get my foot in the door? \r\n\r\nThe reputation of the company is difficult, but the style of the company is to stay humble - I've never seen the company defend themselves against the harmful and discrediting news that exists. I personally think they should defend themselves a little more - they are between a rock and a hard place in many instances of service. I personally experienced visiting someone's home where the issues they were having with their connection was due to a tree root growing into the cable lines which had been their for over 20 years. Things like that cannot be diagnosed over a phone call. It's hard work in the field for sure. Being a part of the corporate side sometimes we're too disconnected from what's happening on the frontline.

This is such a slap in the face as most employees were unhappy with the office situation in the first place. There are also an incredible amount of fully remote employees on the same teams as those who are forced to be hybrid, so this decision is arbitrary and unfair. Now if I have a cold or an injury, but am otherwise capable of WFH, I have to not work and take PTO which is obviously limited.

Numbers does not always mean someone will be a good supervisor. The supervisors I\u2019ve dealt with were disrespectful, sexist, racist, always said things that were out of line involving my business or others. I remember a supervisor started speaking in a asian tone as to mock asians during a meeting. No one laughed. There were allegedly a group of people trying to form a union. The supervisors threatened all the employees that they would be fired, so the members all left the union group afraid to lose their jobs. You can\u2019t fire someone for attempting to create a union since its illegal, but hey! But supervisors who dont even own the company were so involved lol, like they would be losing out. Some of them said things a supervisor should not say trying to threaten employees. They DO NOT PROPERLY LEAD GENERATE. I looked at leads from my fellow employees and the ones sent to me, they got sales from their leads and i didnt. I brought this up many times, but there was always an excuse and that i had to work harder. I had leads taken from me because a supervisor was upset that I would not call a customer back that cursed at me. Same supervisor talked down on employees, cut them off, harrassed, snd even made racist comments. Not that it matters since we\u2019re not in office, the men prey on the women. I had an experience where a guy was too close on purpose standing behind me liek I didn\u2019t notice what he did brushing by. Disgusting man! Supervisors forming personal relationships with staff and promotions, what a joke. The management team has a women who is horrible. She doesn\u2019t take initiative for your concerns. She speaks with sarcasm. Just know if you\u2019re not meeting your numbers, your value as a person is diminished. I could go on and on about the mental tole this company has caused me. In fact, I want to gather a group of employees and take a stand against this oppressive company. Only about 20 percent hits numbers, while the rest of the employees who dont are treated like trash. If you\u2019re a single mother with kids, they are quick to throw in your face about why you need to hit those numbers, your kids. An employee told me many stories about how she was talked down to about not meeting numbers and how her children were always brought into the equation. For my knowledge, they didnt send her good leads and she saw how they gave good leads to other employees. Think twice. This job has become way harder because of how they changed their lead generation. The system was easier in 2020 with better management, but now they altered it to weed out employees they want to they want to let go of. The staff there only care about themselves and the money you will make them. Again, you lose value once you dont hit goal. I was on a good team and entire management a while ago. That\u2019s when comcast messed up, putting me with caddy women. One a supervisor, the other a manager. It\u2019s sad! I\u2019ve dealt with racism from my own people assuming things about me because I am black. Comments made that should have not been said.

For no apparent or good reason that can be explained to Frontline, this happens to a large portion of our customer, and if we get that \"Can't be completed instore\" then we do not get credit for the sale and can't assist the customer.

Essentially taking away my earned merit raises for my time and outstanding reviews. Found out a brand new hire who lives in the same state as me just an hour away was offered $2 more than me. I just wanted to keep my pay, and they said no, but gave $2 extra to some unvetted new person. I've been told the geocode is the reason. Sounds like excuses to disvalue employees. Comcast would have you believe you are valued, you are not. YOu are a number. They are going through even more cut backs and downsizing again just 6 months after I was cut for the same reasons. Cable is suffering from streaming services and they cant keep up, so they just cut people. Doesnt matter if you have 5 years or 45 years, you are not safe here. YOu are not valued here. They claim to be fighting inequality in the work place and working to close the gap in pay inequality. I'm not sure giving me (a displaced rehire who just got financially set back years in this mess)$2 less than a brand new hire man is satisfying those goals Comcast. They expect the employee to do whats right, they do not follow that example. Its hard to grow with a company when you'r'e constantly getting set back and slapped down. This is the 2nd waive of cut backs i've bene caught in so they can save some money. The first time was the warehouse closings. They outsourced good community jobs in favor of cheap temp labor. They brag that 3rd party testing facility offers more jobs! They hire 1000 people! Mostly all temp jobs, no insurance, no bene's and low pay.

The Comcast call centers are the corporate version of game of thrones. I am convinced they use some type of Landmark brainwashing to condition people to be obvious to abuse. I feel like I was mentally molested by creeps. Over half of the incoming calls are NOT inbound sales calls. Comcast gets fined by the government if customers are on hold for an extended length of time. Therefore once a customer has held for Customer Service or Tech Support and hits the threshold--the calls are diverted to inbound sales BECAUSE SALES ALWAYS ANSWERS. I was misled and the job was not what I agreed to when I accepted it. Impossible sales goals made the job an albatross around my neck. Every call counts against the sales agent and to compound the grief half the calls are to troubleshoot a modem or cancel all services. I brought the issue up frequently and managers and supervisors denied the truth. After a while a coworker (someone I trained with) called me to say that her manager confirmed what I maintained was correct. Not only that, Comcast was losing business because of their heavy reliance on third party companies they outsourced to service calls. So Comcast ended a lot of those overseas (Philippines) contracts and literally brought in a massive amount of new \"sales hires\" as a substitute. We were so used. I brought this up with my supervisor and was terminated soon thereafter. Ghetto environment, poor no mentorship and poor leadership. Supervisors play favorites and bully sales agents with fluctuating quotas THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET unless adjustments are made to an individual's call flow (filtering out the non-sales/overflow calls). Yes I said that--supervisors decide whether a sales agent's phone receives mostly sales calls or mostly overflow calls from other departments. That should be illegal--that's NOT EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. My employment was terminated because I spent four nights in the hospital with a life threatening emergency (\"at will employment.\") It gets worse. To add insult to injury, I had been a customer for about 20 years before working there and paid promotional rates of. about $80/month for cable and internet. While I was an employee I received a deep discount on cable and internet. After termination I was sent a bill for almost $400 for my \"monthly service\" and called to ask for a promotion. I was shocked to learn former employees pay \"every day price $$$\" and are ineligible for promotions. That's CRAZY. I was an inbound sales agent and I KNOW what my bill should be and I know how the promotions work. That was insult to injury. Again, that was the WORST JOB EVER. During onboarding and training I was TOLD my income would be a minimum of $24/hr if I made a sale on each call. I was lucky to average out at $15/hr because most calls were un-sellable by nature. The Human Resources department is HUGE and unprofessional. Random hr people show up in Teams meetings and shame sales agents. I was admonished for not mentioning the ACP credit on each call. I immediately spoke up and said go back and listen because I know FOR A FACT I mention it--because I have notes on each call and write it down as I mention it. The supervisor snarled at me and said he would have a look but was never resolved. Comcast still owes me pay for time on the clock--employees have to do their own timekeeping/troubleshooting it when the app is inaccurate. They use \"KRONOS\" for electronic timekeeping and it's common for the app to glitch. Good luck getting an override on a computer error. COMCAST OWES ME MONEY!!!! THAT'S CRAZY!!!! SLEAZY!!!!! Impossible to get anyone on the phone to help resolve an issues post employment. I have never been so disrespected by an employer in my life. Managers/supervisers play with people for sport and I'm sure at a certain level they make money off of us. There are layers and levels of \"people\" in that rodeo of \"upper management\" and they all play the game to keep their own job. The \"managers and supervisors\" were bigger idiots than the three stooges. I was instructed to respond to emails, update my timekeeping, read through supplemental \"training materials\", and do \"homework\" during UNSCHEDULED HOURS--in other words I was in strutted too work off the clock. My research shows me class action lawsuits are common and I contacted an attorney who told me it wouldn't be worth my time because Comcast would smother me with their high powered corporate attorneys. I felt mentally abused when I work there and I have PTSD. It's been really hard to digest the nightmares I experienced at Comcast and has had a negative impact on my health and wellbeing post employment. This is a bad time to be unemployed. I am a single Mom with three children. Comcast never cared about me as a human being. Comcast never will. If you apply, continue with onboarding and are presented with a compensation package that seems too good to be true--HANG UP AND RUN--DON'T WALK! I have more to say and will save it for another day. I took a lot of screenshots and recorded a lot of conversations/meetings to have evidence that corroborates everything I have written here. And more. I filed a complaint with the EEOC that was ACCEPTED (YAYYYYY!!!!) however I can't mention the \"event\" here for legal reasons.
