The management was not interested in job performance as much as who LIKED who better, who had the filthiest mouth and everything else that makes people feel included and/or part of something. Not to mention there was always some sort of competition going on for the affection or should I say attention from anyone in a leadership position, (smh) that it was difficult to really understand what was expected of you. Another thing is, I started working for this company a week or so after I buried my mother the year before only to lose the job in March due to Covid-19. Went to apply at Residence inn and it just so happened that the front desk manager who was promoted from housekeeping at this hotel knew the supervisor KG (initials) at the Hilton who apparently spoke against me because Residence inn hired me in a face to face interview and told to come the following day to complete the hiring paperwork. However, during my interview I mentioned working with KG and after I left the interview the front desk manager at Residence inn contacted KG about me, not long after leaving the interview I received a call from Residence inn front desk manager stating they had decided to move on with a different candidate. I don't know what KG said to that front desk manager at Residence inn about me, but whatever it was it cost me job. I had no idea that KG had an issue with me. I learned the operating system Opera fairly quickly and I was at Hilton barely 3 months before Covid-19 showed up, then let go. I was under the impression that I did everything I could to show I'm a hard worker, easy to work with and get along with and everything else. I even earned a gift card as a nice gesture from KG, and she didn't have to do this because I actually did not meet the goal that was set. The gift card was given to me while still in training because I showed initiative once being given the opportunity to start working with the guests.
