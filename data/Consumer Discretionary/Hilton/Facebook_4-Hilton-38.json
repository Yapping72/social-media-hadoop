If you are looking for a fun, friendly and open-minded place to work it is not for you.\r\nAll they care about is efficiency and profit, they pretend they care about their 'team members' with an attempt to create a culture that recognises people but they only do this to improve their productivity, if they cared about their workers they would pay them above the minimum wage and would have a work-life balance policy.\r\n\r\nLOW PAY - EXPLOITATION\r\n\r\nThis organisation exploits graduates who have university degrees and give people 'internships' as an excuse to pay them less money and to give people less employment rights, even though these internships are not internships at all; they are full-time jobs. What is even worse, these internships are often PA roles, an example of a lack of transparency.\r\n\r\nHIERARCHY\r\n\r\nThe organisation is very hierarchical and your retention will depend on whether your subordinates like you.

I am skeptical seeing one star reviews, so I wanted to clarify a few pieces of information before I begin my review:\r\n\r\n1. I want to say Hilton as an overall company is absolutely wonderful. My low rating is regarding the Hilton Reservations and Customer Care branch of Hilton in Carrollton, TX. Specifically, the Operations Department. If you see an opportunity that you are interested in at a hotel or at one of the corporate offices, I would highly recommend applying. \r\n\r\n2. I left Hilton because I found a new job, my employment was not terminated and I was not encouraged to find a new job. I have been in my new position for several weeks and I wanted to wait and see if I still felt compelled to write a review. I have decided to do so because I was not given the opportunity to do an exit interview and the feedback I had provided several times to my supervisor and the larger Operations leadership team before I left was not given the attention or serious reflection I felt was necessary. This feedback included my own observations as well as feedback I had received from other people within the Operations department who were not comfortable approaching their supervisors with their concerns because they saw their colleagues who did so get harassed, bullied, and ultimately, forced out of their positions or fired.", "cons": "My reasons for only giving a one-star rating are:\r\n\r\n1. Undocumented/unpublished position expectations/tasks, but employees are held to a standard that is not available for them to review.\r\n\r\n2. Position expectations have been changing over the last year; however, there is a lack of proper training to meet the new/changing position expectations. While I understand some initiative is required to find answers and solutions to tasks, it is not appropriate to expect training for the largest chunks of a position\u2019s responsibility to be entirely informal, ad hoc research.\r\n\r\n3. For lack of a better phrase, there is a \u201cmean girl\u201d mentality - there is no opportunity for formal development/training and Operations leadership decides who is or isn\u2019t performing well based on unpublished expectations and personal bias/opinions.\r\n\r\n4. Lack of respect of employee time and other life priorities. Unrealistic deadlines, lack of leadership, and accountability from the Operations leadership team are needed so that as ad hoc requests come in, priorities/tasks are recalibrated. Many of my personal tasks/responsibilities and those of the other members of my team were told that all tasks on our plates were still top priority if an urgent ad hoc request came in. This lack of focus and unwillingness to prioritize department responsibilities contribute to a chaotic and poorly managed department. Additionally, many employees felt burned out and worked long hours to try and finish all top priority tasks within the deadlines they were given so as to stay in line with what their individual manager defined as meeting deadlines.\r\n\r\n5. Unprofessional behavior and favoritism from leadership team. I personally witnessed on several occasions Operations leaders screaming at their employees, using abusive language that demeaned and embarrassed their direct reports. Employees who did bring their concerns forward to HR were put on performance plans by the Operations leaders and were eventually forced to quit. Additionally, other members of the Operations leadership team showed blatant favoritism and also displayed unprofessional behavior when managing their own teams as well as when interacting with employees on other teams within the Operations department. One example, one of the Operations leaders was discussing personal performance details of several of their direct reports with employees from other teams who were not members of the Operations leadership team. These performance details and the feedback they heard from the employees they were speaking with regarded other team members who that leader had run into issues with in the past.\r\n\r\n6. Inconsistent/unfair expectations and standards within teams - especially when it comes to job perks like working remotely. People on the same team/who have the same position title are not held to the same standards. The confluence of position expectations not being available to employees, favoritism, low employee morale due to poor team culture, and the unwillingness of Operations leadership to challenge themselves to create a team environment and culture that supports remote employees, have all led to a confusing, seemingly subjective decision-making process to decide who gets to continue working remotely vs who must now start coming back onsite. Employees who have met or exceeded their performance goals in recent reviews have been forced to come back onsite while other employees who are on the same team or who hold the same exact position title and who also met or exceeded performance goals in recent reviews are allowed to continue working remotely.\r\n\r\n7. Lack of leadership/vision from Operations leadership. To me, this is the core problem. The lack of leadership and vision has created a vacuum that has allowed for employees who are still developing as leaders to take control and drastically change the team culture and working environment. The leadership team uses bullying, harassment, and fear-based management and leadership tactics to try and control their teams. Employees fear going to HR because of the backlash they expect to receive from their supervisor once HR speaks with the supervisor about the feedback they received. They have seen multiple employees who did go to HR be forced out of Hilton entirely. Additionally, input received from employees is not taken seriously. There is a staggering lack of accountability within the leadership team, and while the overall Hilton Reservations and Customer Care branch is undergoing a period of big change, the Operations leadership contributes any negative feedback received to \u201cchange being difficult\u201d. For me, this is indicative of the problem. Operations employees do not feel respected, and while change can be hard, chalking up widespread feelings of disrespect to change being difficult is both ignorant and arrogant. Employees want to be heard and have their concerns addressed, but when the Operations leadership is not even willing to reflect on how they are creating/contributing to an environment that breeds disrespect, it is extraordinarily difficult to make meaningful changes so that employees feel respected and heard. Employees should not fear providing feedback directly to their supervisor or even go anonymously to HR in case their supervisor is able to pinpoint the individual who discussed their concerns."}, {"review_title": "A fantastic company with fantastic opportunities", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "28 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Assistant Director of Finance in Berlin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The chance to work in multiple locations worldwide.\r\nExcellent employee benefits.\r\nA variety of courses and schemes to help you progress down your chosen path", "cons": "Month end reporting has to be carried out to tight deadlines so weekend work required if necessary."}, {"review_title": "Hilton was my first hotel employer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Heavy focus on training & mentoring as compared to other hotel chains, ample opportunity for advancement, good benefits and respect for life-work balance", "cons": "impersonal, monolitic and purely number-driven corporate overlords.  most advancement opportunities require relocation."}, {"review_title": "Good hotel terrible senior management especially General manager", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Apr 2011", "job_title": " in Charlotte, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great  location , good reputation, many dedicated staff members", "cons": "General manager micro manages every detail of the operation.

Who made it and who stayed made absolutely no sense as some seriously talented people (were laid off) and WERE NOT assisted in finding new roles internally. In fact, in some cases they hired new candidates with next to no experience over the ones that were being cut during the layoff.  Now, that should speak volumes, either low incoming pay or horrid decision makers with no loyalty in leadership (mix of both.) Even hiring new employees only to lay them off a few months later.  I can't tell you how many times a younger face with NO REAL experience has been promoted to a (rarely available) senior position over another longer term or more experienced employee. No wonder morale is still so incredibly low. This new antiquated structure basically made the eCommerce offices relegated to call center support reps  (who are treated like pariahs). All that talent wasted on being reactive only. The other division - the newly developed Destinations career track is the current hot commodity - but that leadership is also completely unqualified for success. Seven months in with still no market plans? No wonder our biggest competitor, Marriott, blows us out of the water. If I were a hotel I'd find a way out of my contract just to get out of the dismal support offered by this new structure.  It really shows how well  Senior Management understands eCommerce if they think that individual hotels have the time & know-how to properly \"self-service\" their own hotel pages and online presence.  You WILL NOT get good foundational Ecommerce knowledge here, no matter what that recruiter promises you. If you value you hard earned education and your hard earned talent - it will be a wasted effort to spend your time at Hilton eCommerce.  Zero growth opportunities, even to other departments. And don't expect support from senior management, the only times they come out of their ivory towers is for self-aggrandizing speeches they drop in and deliver to the hub offices - but can't be bothered to converse with the plebians.

Doing this recon I found several checks that had been cashed were voided and checks where the funds were returned but the check had not been cashed. Sometimes a check had been cashed more than once. This account was neglected for almost a year a management thought it could be fixed in a month.I was also involved in the daily funding process. The funding was supposed to be submitted to treasury by 12 but quite often it was never ready by that time. The 12 deadline meant nothing to the people preparing the funding. One time we had a second funding request to do and it had to be submitted by 4 and the deadline was missed. The approvers for the funding request did not consider getting the funding request approved a top priority. One time I emailed the person approving the funding that day I would be sending it shortly and she disappeared without telling, another approver would often forget to approve it or email the wrong person when approving it. The team I was on would often analyze accounts and offer solutions. The problem was is the people we made the recommendations to would often not act on our suggestions and my managers were incapable of telling the person they reported too they were not getting cooperation to fix the issue.
