Their success is really what makes us go-go-go! \r\n\r\nCompensation is OK. They know that they're one of the only places in town with international brand recognition in a highly visible consumer industry, so they know they don't have to overpay to get good talent. \r\n\r\nImpressive gender diversity in senior leadership. It's really inspiring to see other women hold truly prominent positions of leadership.  \r\n\r\nGood diversity in rank and file.\r\n\r\nNice facilities (though always cramped - most floors are open layout and seemed to get smaller and smaller over time as they squished us into nicer looking but more cramped spaces over time) and a well maintained physical working environment (at least, in a pre-pandemic world).", "cons": "As great as some of the leadership is, leadership at the top levels are usually very political (par for the course in big orgs), and some are breathtakingly poor leaders. \r\n\r\nAt this point, most don't have to read \"Good to Great\" to know that leadership is critical to strong organizations. Hilton has marginal leadership training and very little \"culture\" around building strong leaders. It's as if the focus is on marketing about how great the culture is vs. the hard work of actually training and holding people accountable to building a great culture. If you're a decent individual contributor and you're around long enough, you'll probably get the ability to manage others, even if you're incompetent at managing, and you'll pretty much get to do what you want. If you're lucky, you report to someone who has some innate leadership skill. If you're not, well...\r\n\r\nEven when senior leaders are widely known to be poor, the organization tends to let them flounder and damage morale for a while before doing something about it (assuming that they do decide to act). That may or may not have to do with the mediocre Human Resources team, who can be expected to basically only do what HR teams at most average places do - protect the company from lawsuits at all costs. When it comes to anything beyond that wheelhouse, they are poorly equipped (just ask a few people about the mass confusion in process from pandemic-related layoffs). \r\n\r\nAlmost no ethnic diversity

Previous team has now been split up into multiple teams. Although some of it does make sense, it wasn't well thought out or communicated well to current employees. Most had to reapply for jobs in the new structure despite leadership leading us to believe that wouldn't be the case causing mass panic. The people who were automatically given roles has made no sense to anyone and appears to be random or based on favoritism. One instance is a manager and SR manager flipping roles on the same team. \r\n\r\nThere hasn't been much growth opportunities in the past partially because nobody leaves the team. It's very likely that's about to change in the new structure as the previous roles have become more of a centralized call center. Probably going to be a lot of burnout and turnover especially early on in new structure. \r\n\r\nIt really is a shame because leadership took something which was clearly working (overall and with revenue numbers) and decided to do something else. One of the reasons given was because our setup isn't been industry standard. I'm highly skeptical the culture will return to the way it was with so many good and talented people working on the team.

Hilton helped me pay my way through grad school as I worked full time in NYC.

Lucky me!!\r\n\r\nHilton has been so good to me and has helped me shape my career. After some time in South Florida, Hilton recognized my hard work with a promotion to work in Dallas at the corporate office. Since working here, I have had the best time.  I've learned SO much, made lifelong friends, enjoyed some amazing benefits, and I actually love waking up and going to work every day.  You can't beat that.\r\n\r\nI'm able to work from home frequently, travel to Hilton hotels at a great discounted rate, and enjoy 25 vacation days each year (plus holidays!).  I also feel lucky because when it's time to start a family, I know Hilton will be so supportive and will offer ample paid time off with my family.\r\n\r\nI hope that one day all of my friends and family will have an opportunity to work at a place they truly love.
