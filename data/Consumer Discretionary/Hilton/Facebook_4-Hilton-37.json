They lie about schedules, they lie about time off, they lie about wages, and worst of all, they lie about job duties.  They tell you it's customer service, which is about the furthest thing from the truth.  It's sales.  Commissioned sales.  And if you don't reach their sales goals, they take away your preferred schedule.  Which means, if you have children or other responsibilities, they will come in second.  They also ask you to not tell the guests calling to make a reservation that you are not on property.  Another lie, albeit of omission.  They don't want folks to know that every call is counted in your metrics.  If you don't book a room on that call, your metrics start to fall.

Being harassed by management when a customer gets angry for something out of your control - and still being told that it was your fault. But when a manager gets an angry customer though, they act nonchalant and almost encourage the guest to complain - their rear isn't on the line, why should they give a crap? But if an associate gets the exact same thing, holy crap, job in jeopardy. Working with a managerial staff that is so obsessed with profit maximization and bowing to corporate that they care not about true service - instead thinking the definition of customer service is smiling at customers, using their name. At the same time, they rape their clients' checking accounts with dishonest charges and fees - and thinking these little, worthless gestures forgive this horrible business practice. Also a horrid culture of communication, and blame is the name of the game. daily accusations of poor performance. Constant threat of termination, and having hours cut at random with no regard to personal needs. Being forced to partake in shady, shady, shaaady business practices.

Or is it all about hotel profits?\r\n\r\n2) The front desk coordinators and spa attendants deserve MUCH better pay. \r\n\r\nYou can't expect above and beyond performance and customer service---for an international company/corporation known for its hospitality---when you're not even willing to meet your employees halfway. \r\n\r\nThe professional burger flipping guys at In and Out Burger get paid starting $12.50/hour in Prescott, while front desk coordinators at HILTON RESORT IN SEDONA get paid a measly $11.25/hr (and spa attendants less than that); \r\n\r\nYET, front desk coordinators are also expected to do their job (to the fullest) AND spa attendant duties whenever spa attendants are not available for shifts, even during super busy spring break season. \r\n\r\nA couple of club members---very kind and generous older lady and elderly lady---helped clean the women's locker rooms one day because we lacked staff.\r\n\r\n3) The food at the employee, mini cafeteria may be free, but the quality seems to be less than that of any dollar menu at fast food joints. \r\n\r\nI have no doubt that IF some of the typical food pics went viral, Hilton would NOT be proud of them, but rather, embarrassed, and even ashamed.\r\n\r\nSo what's way off about this whole picture?

Everything you say and do is constantly scrutinized and picked apart.  \r\n*Well, it's a call center job.  Like any call center job, you are treated like just a number.

After being there for 10 years, I was rewarded by being forced to move from a decent daytime schedule to working an overnight schedule. Totally ridiculous and impossible to have any sort of life outside of work with that sort of schedule.  \r\n*Team member travel rate is very difficult to find available, even when booking a year in advance.  Good luck finding a date where the rate is available AND you can get PTO approved to actually go.

We would ask the guest at the end of the call if they'd be interested in learning more - if yes, transfer to HGV team, if no, thank them and end the call.  Pump the breaks - hold on! Because I swear, everyone was so nice and patient with us during training, but no lie ...it seems like someone threw a switch on my NHC because he became someone different and not for the better.  Immediately after training - during the \"nesting\" period, and I do mean IMMEDIATELY like a couple of days fresh out of training and a day or two taking calls, we were scheduled to meet with our NHC (New Hire Concierge). During that time, our call/calls were scruntinized, criticized and evaluated. I expected that, BUT NOT AFTER ONLY ONE OR TWO DAYS FRESH OUT OF TRAINING. Are you kidding me? AND...it became painfully clear in the several group/individual meetings immediately following training that the HGV \"soft sell\" was bogus. Your metric numbers and even pay are hinged on your conversion rate - how many callers that are \"lookers\" become \"bookers\" (as they say). I was told that there would be 10 weeks of \"probationary\" work before we were graduated to the virtual sales floor. However, if our metrics and numbers and whatever else wasn't up to par, we'd be booted. We were told we'd be meeting with the NHC 2-3 times/week for discussion and there is some system in place that \"knows\" when we're asking the right questions or not.

The hotel discounts are good but finding an available hotel is very difficult (don't plan on staying anywhere on the weekend cause it wont happen), turnover is high with supervisors and they only care about the big picture which is expecting way too much from agents with each call. They also do not like if you have to take medical leave or maternity leave which resulted in a lot of people not coming back after taking leave. Your experience also depends on who you work under. Some supervisors are great and appreciative of what agents do, others barely give a \"good job\" when you meet all of their ridiculous expectations. Working from home is nice, however their virtual system is constantly having issues, calls get dropped, system freezes and requires you to reboot your entire computer, programs that we use do not work. Even though the issues are on their end they expect you to still be able to work through it, and if it happens enough time they will fire you without warning for having too many issues, even though the issues are on their end. Pay starts low and with yearly raises you would still have to remain with the company for a long time before making a reasonable wage. Full time employees get to bid on a schedule every 6 months but its based on seniority, which means if you've been with the company for less than 3 or 4 years then you'll most likely get a terrible schedule. Work/life balance is also awful and don't even think about getting to spend the holidays with family if they are out of town/state.

It took time to correct however managers and staff were stressed with additional responsibilities with no increase in pay.  Supervisors and first level managers work the hardest with the least pay or recognition.  Lack of respect for the worker is also shown in the poor budgeting for uniforms and supplies. HR departments can only do so much to show the team member's love yet they get the blame.   All departments should be responsible yet they are not accountable.   Now that Unite-HERE is threatening in some cities, the corporate office is putting their emphasis on the team members this year trying to clean up the mess they started with their tight fiscal policies, demand for 50% flow-through etc.  But they underestimate how intelligent their employees are.

Since I am doing housekeeping I have to work with dirty linen and you can catch 3 types of hepatitis from it in rare cases. Although rare it would of been nice to know this but they dont put it in the training videos or even talk about it. The only reason I know that you can get hepatitis is because I saw a small piece of paper hanging on the wall in breakpoint one day advertising free shots if you work at hilton to help prevent this. That if great and all but I only stumbled upon this by chance since I had everything done and just decided to read the wall there. They have a discount on hotels program but almost every hotel is not available even in the slowest months of the year. At this time of year our hotel occupancy is only at 10% when I worked today and still nothing. \r\n\r\nI was my hands there constantly because of all the dirty stuff I touch on a dailuy bases there and my hands are cracking so bad from this, cold weather and chenicals I have to use on a daily bases that I am worried about exposing myself to hep or something. I cant even use gloves because there are no gloves in my size to use. They have these yellow ones but you need to put multiple on a day and there is not even close to enough. I have to dig through the boxes of gloves to be lucky to find 1 pair. Most sizes are in womens because the women are the ones who clean the rooms, I only pick up the linen from them afterwords. The union is also very weak in this company and costs $1.00 a day if you want to join. Not bad but it adds up over the year and when only making $10.00 an hour this is alot of money.Overall it just seems like the company doesnt care about there employees very much and am upset I didnt take the other job opportunity when I had the chance. I figured I could work my way up and it would be nice to have the option to change states since Hilton is state and even worldwide. They are open to tranfsering but I am in the process of looking for a new job already. \r\n\r\nThe job schedule doesnt bother me to much but it may bother some. The other day I worked 7 days in a row before my 2 day weekend. I come back to work for 3 days and than got another 2 days off. I have heard of some people working 10 days in a row and than getting 4 days off in a row afterwords.\r\n\r\nAlso since Hilton is a hotel company you do have to work on holidays which is fine but overtime should be included in this. The company does let you use one of you paid vacations if you choose to for an extra 8 hours on your check but its kind of BS if you ask me. In all I dont feel like Hilton cares about its employees very much or at least the Housekeepers who work there.\r\n\r\nI would definetly not recommend this job to anybody unless you are desperate like I was when trying to find a job. By the way I have only seen the head of housekeeping 1 time and that is when he introduced himself when he got the new job at out location. It would be nice to see him every once in a while because I dont even know what he does really. He is in his office in a completely different building than where our housekeeping office is located.

The schedule isn't under my control. At all. So I just do what's already written for me. If someone else double books me it's apparently now MY fault. Which I can do nothing about. I have no control of anything. The vans are supposed to run every half hour, they don't. \r\n4. Several times I've gotten told to pick up someone at the airport. They don't give me a name of who I'm looking for or a gender. Just that I have a pick up. Several times this has resulted in no one actually being at the air port. \r\n5. Manager seemingly only enforces the dress code with me. Other drivers show up consistently not wearing the assigned uniform. If I show up with my shirt slightly untucked I get in trouble. \r\n6. Manager has been informed repeatedly that I have work restrictions due to a documented disability. Manager gets pissy when I explain to her I cannot do certain tasks (or work overtime) due to physical restrictions. \r\n7. Allows the front desk girls to designate pickup areas outside of the 5 mile radius that is within hotel policy then gets upset with me when I do as I'm told and pick these people up. For example: A woman wanted a ride at least 25 miles away from the hotel (well out of range of the 5 mile policy) front desk girl tells the woman I can take her. When I contest this, I'm told to do it anyway, then later berated for doing what I was told to do. \r\n\r\nThe first supervisor literally had NONE of these problems. At all. I was never double booked. She never assumed I'd be working when I wasn't scheduled. She didn't force me to stay hours after my shift. New manager schedules me for days that I'm not supposed to be on then gets upset when I tell her I can't work those days. Makes snide remarks about \"Why can't you work like a normal person\" even though she also knows I have a disability. As far as I'm aware this specific shift position has had A LOT of walk outs and random quits. If I didn't need the money so bad I would be one of them but as of now there's not much I can do other than suffer."}, {"review_title": "RMCC Americas", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Revenue Specialist in Addison, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company culture, fantastic work life balance and PTO (even compared to non-hospitality companies), Team-Member Travel Program, and an abundance of resources for career development.", "cons": "The compensation is great for hospitality backgrounds, but below national and regional average for Revenue Management/Finance based jobs.

One coworker was hospitalized for pneumonia and a respiratory bacterial infection, which she apparently brought up to our Director that mold may have been the cause. I reminded management about the filthy filters even though I found out that they had known about this issue for a while, and didn\u2019t make it a priority to fix it several months ago. I highly respect and admire many qualities of our management team; however, I wondered if they---especially the owner of this franchise Hilton---truly care about the health and well-being of their staff.\r\n- habitual, passive-aggressive drama from a few employees, which made me question whether or not it was worth working at a place that can often be draining, despite the recurring, fear-based/dense/negative energy coming from a few individuals.\r\n- the front desk coordinators and spa attendants deserve MUCH better pay. You can't expect above and beyond performance and customer service---for an international company/corporation known for its hospitality---when you're not even willing to meet your employees halfway. The professional burger flipping guys at In & Out get paid starting $12.50/hour in Prescott, while front desk coordinators at HILTON IN SEDONA get paid $11.25/hr (and spa attendants less than that). What's way off about that picture? Everything. \r\n- the food at the employee, mini cafeteria may be free, but the quality seems to be less that that of any dollar menu at fast food joints.

It's a shame that, given the ruthless and toxic work environment that clothes itself in the familial and collegiate, they won't last very long.", "cons": "Health benefits are deducted from your paycheck after taxes for your first 90 days, which leaves you with very little take-home pay. The choices of investments offered in the company 401K are very limited, and the T. Rowe Price website is not very user friendly.\r\n\r\nPay is very low, compared to industry standards - about $15,000 to $30,000 less than what you would find elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTraining is lackluster in some areas, and practically non-existent in others. For a company that claims it spends over $10,000 training new hires, it certainly doesn't show. Criteria for evaluations is not applied consistently - there is a constant \"moving of the goal posts,\" where one evaluator will tell you to do something, and then the next evaluator will tell you that what the last one said was completely wrong, and that you should do the exact opposite. It only sets new hires up for failure. It also ensures job security for instructors and evaluators in RM Enablement, at the expense of the new hires' morale and physical/mental/emotional health.\r\n\r\nNew Hire Managers do not truly make themselves available to new hires - they don't check in with anyone, and they force everyone to come to them, which is not very convenient, nor is always a viable option. Their one-on-one meetings with employees are not truly about answering questions or hearing concerns, but about enforcing conformity and eliminating all dissent. Furthermore, anything you say will be reported back to Directors and Assistant Directors (despite the New Hire Managers' claims of confidentiality) for the purposes of being used against you later.\r\n\r\nManagement claims they welcome all feedback and suggestions, but nothing could be further from the truth, especially when it comes to feedback concerning training. RM Enablement - the department responsible for training new hires - does not/cannot tolerate criticism. Those who dare to question or criticize RM Enablement will find themselves being reprimanded or terminated.\r\n\r\nThere is also a systemic pattern of racism, sexism, and ageism in the RMCC, where certain classes of individuals are routinely punished, denied advancement, denied pay raises, given harsher evaluations and feedback, and subjected to a negative and hostile work environment while others are given preferential treatment. For example, one previous incoming class of Revenue Specialists saw one half of the class (being of a particular gender) breeze through mocks with little or no problems, while the other half was practically raked over the coals for every little thing imaginable.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to get into revenue management, I would strongly advise looking elsewhere. Unless you have extensive hospitality experience, the learning curve is just too high. Also, Hilton's training is an absolute joke. You won\u2019t learn anything in their classes, and instructors/evaluators are directed to justify their existence by finding fault with even the littlest of things - when they say \u201cthere will always be feedback,\u201d what they really mean is \u201cnothing you do will ever be enough to satisfy us, because if we can't find anything to criticize off-hand, we will go looking for something/anything.\u201d\r\n\r\nYou will burn out very quickly in that role, and most people don\u2019t last beyond 1-2 years. During that time, this company will stress you out, make you miserable, and generally push you past your breaking point. You will be reduced to a neurotic mess, and that\u2019s if you don\u2019t suffer a nervous breakdown, like I did. (Many people working there are on some type of anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medication - it really is an unhealthy environment)\r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor: Stay far away from Hilton.
