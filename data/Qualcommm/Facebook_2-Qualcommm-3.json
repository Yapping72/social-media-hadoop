Low pay with trivial increase/promotion opportunities compared to the Bay Area, while San Diego's rental home and real estate markets aren't cheap at all, compared to the Bay Area; you save $10,000 per year at maximum in renting a home at San Diego, but your annual salary is at least $30,000 less than your peers in the Bay Area, and every one can do the math;\r\n\r\n3. Workload is heavy all the time, and that is the way how the Project Management wants to hire you. You won't have time for exercising in the gyms;\r\n\r\n4. Benefits will be significantly cut starting from 2016. In the past, $0 out from the pocket; the 2016 deductible plan requires self-pay for the first a few thousand dollars. The company seems to encourage senior people to leave by themselves and discourage employees to take sick leave and see a doctor by announcing this benefit change;\r\n\r\n5. Apart from those good people, there are too many bad people as well. Some guys refuse to collaborate every time, and they just blindly throw issues to other teams and wasting other people's time, even without doing a simple checking by themselves; some guys with Electrical Engineering background are really bad in their coding styles. Those poorly written implementations create a whole lot of traps for other people, and they are creating bugs everyday for their owners too;\r\n\r\n6. A lot of politics. When an issue comes, every team declines their responsibility. A poor guy with a politically powerless leader will usually make the fix and gets blamed at last.\r\n\r\n7. Too complex and unscalable systems with crappy design. Every team stays in their own technical area, and do not know what other teams are doing. This partially contributes to the politics mentioned in (6).\r\n\r\n8. Greedy and unrealistic scheduling with no software engineering methodologies. For instance, to bring up a feature with teams from layer-1, layer-2 and layer-3, and a high layer has functional dependency on a low layer. If the water-fall method can be used, i.e. let layer-1 to start first, and resolve all their issues before delivering things to layer-2 and layer-3, things will be much easier. The reality is that, the Project Management always wants all teams to work in parallel and expect things to get done within a month. It seems like the Scrum method is always the choice at QCT, and in fact every day is a mess with this SW engineering method. In order to have the bring up to happen, every team is making temporary but dirty workarounds, which should be replaced or discarded in the near future. So, why not start earlier and leave more time for the ultimate clean solution? It turns out that, all the efforts for those dirty and temporary solutions get be wasted.\r\n\r\n9. Long hours throughout the year, and promotions takes long for ordinary people. I am not a racist but I did realize that some guys with the same race as those mid-Management guys seems to be favored by the mid-Management, and they can enjoy their days lazily and get promotion even quicker than other employees who work really hard. For ordinary people, it usually takes 5-6 reviews to get a promotion, no matter how hard you work. It's not worth it to work so hard, and sacrifice your health and your family.\r\n\r\n10. A lot of global testing/technical support offices, and they are generating issues at late night or on weekends. All issues are shoot back to San Diego and you are expected to resolve them ASAP. Why can't those offshore teams resolve issues locally? Why can't they wait until business hours in San Diego?\r\n\r\n11. A lot of inefficient weekend support which turns out to be a waste of time. When those leaders tried to resolve an issue during weekends, it takes a long time for engineers to wait for each other. Time for relaxing the body and recovering from tiredness is wasted in such meaningless waiting. An issue that can be resolved in 30 minutes in a business day will take almost a whole day to get resolved on weekends. So why not do the work quickly on Monday? Engineers cannot take a rest on weekends, as a punishment, they won't work efficiently during business hours in the next week. What is gain, what is the benefit for rushing on weekends? Even worse, weekend support is forcing good engineers to leave the company.\r\n\r\n12. No investment to the growing technical areas from the high management. In recent years, QC has been creating trivial feature combos, which Customers do not even pay attention to. Those nasty combos had created millions of bugs, and had exhausted QC's engineering work-force. As in a negative feedback loop, everyone is busy fixing bugs everyday, and won't have time to invent for the future.\r\n\r\n13. Bug fixing is preferred over a clean design. Things happen too quickly, and there is always no time for a good and clean design. There are far too many poor designs were implemented in products, and they simply do not work in reality. Various teams are forced to hack out dirty workarounds that might break something else tomorrow. Test teams are testing the same thing over and over again, before things can work."}], [{"review_title": "Might be a good company to start for semi-conductor, but useless for Software People", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 May 2016", "job_title": "Associate Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1) Decent pay, as per industry standards\r\n2) Good food, available almost all time\r\n3) Ample time for freshers to ramp-up to have stable start in career.\r\n4) Decent work-life balance for some teams.", "cons": "1) Majority of good people are leaving the company\r\n2) Semi-annual appraisal cycle (a major pro of Qualcomm over others), changed to annual.\r\n3) Team allocation of freshers is bogus.

The small perks are going away little by little--many of us watched this happen at previous companies and we know that once cost cutting starts it usually never stops.  Hopefully that won't happen here, but most of us assume it will.  Insurance is still free but starting next year pays out virtually nothing until you hit a (middle range) deductible.  \r\n\r\nOvertime is generally expected.  I sometimes get \"vacation notices\" for people who will be out of town for the weekend.  A lot of people here are in the habit of working at least a little every day, and many of them work an excessive number of hours.  Hard to say if it's expected by management or just a self-imposed drive to keep up with everyone else, but it's way more normal here than at my last company.\r\n\r\nAdding a little bit to address my \"culture\" rating below.  I gave it low marks because the culture of the company as a whole is \"California\".  Everything is CA-centric, and there is little effort put into making the \"satellite\" sites integrate into the corporate whole.  My previous company did a much better job of being a group of sites with similar culture throughout.  Qualcomm is CA all the way, and CA values are often at the extreme of the values of the rest of the country (example, we hear about saving water constantly, when it's really only an issue in CA right now).  The culture in Raleigh is mostly task oriented.  We get along, we work together.  We help each other out.  It could be better but for the most part it's very good."}, {"review_title": "Generally Good, But Watch Your Back", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "29 Apr 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary and benefits, nice working conditions, some very smart people, the company tries to do the right things for employees within the constraints of being a publicly traded company.", "cons": "Backstabbing, politics, a lot of entrenched employees with 20+ years tenure means change is slow.

HR's don't have any voice , if you think Qualcomm has better hr policies then most of the Indian start up s now a days has these kind of policies so this does not make them any different.\r\n- pay wise also its not that great as now a days you will get similar pay in many companies but yes they pay good amount (not bad)\r\n- If you have any problem or concern there is hardly any mechanism where it can be addressed , as i said HR department here is useless they don't do anything .\r\n- Cafeteria food is really bad , Unless you are a bachelor or u have some problem u will never like to eat . even that's worse than college cafeteria. \r\n- Team outing are plagued by budget constraints, there are 3-4 team outings every year  lunch , lunch , half day , full day . half day full day outings are meaningless once you stay more years in company and same thing happens every year . they will take you to a resort but if any sports needs extra payment that cannot be done , So virtually u only goto one place play cricket which normally comes with package and come back. , even no one is interested also  .\r\n- Many managers are with medieval times IT company attitude , they don't see whether work is done or not but they are more interested in keeping you busy . In qualcomm 85% of time u will be busy there will be never a free day , even all the days you have to put more than 10-11 hours for work . but if at all one day you are free if you  leave office on time (Not early) then some managers start giving you junk work just to keep you busy .\r\n- no proper documentation in work you do, so you have to learn all by yourself.\r\n- Slowly they have made the company like a school with lot of tracking , they are increasing manpower who will track but really less engineers who work below , So its becoming like a reverse pyramid .\r\n- Ratings are 2 times in year so you will get some hike every 6 months  , but ratings does not match with your performance . There are minimum fixed no of cycle after which you will get promotion so its irrelevant if you work word better or bad . if you are top performer also if that takes 2.5 years to goto next level and average performer will make that in same 2.5 years or 3 years in worst case .\r\n- There is a false hope in some employees also HRs try to show during offer letter that there is opportunity to change teams after you are bored in same kind of work or shift to other geographical locations across sites for your career growth based on your interest . This is almost non existent . Once you apply for team change ,your ratings will be affected by current managers , there are few good managers who will be encouraging you to change teams but that's very less .Opportunity across geographical locations are almost NIL, Don't be fooled by the hollow statements . Now with all checks  in India office its almost impossible . Upper management in India has made such process that no one cannot even think to apply across sites ,\r\n- most of the  Indian managers don't have any voice , they are always running the rat race to prove some non existent things . Simple formula is u work on same thing as ur US counterpart is working , then tell Indian upper management that you did it yourself .\r\n- There are no recreational options with in office , No Foosball table even . There was one Foosball table earlier but as people were playing much it was removed on pretext of productivity , Such is the attitude of managers here .\r\n- Occasionally there are few activities by HRs like CSR activity , dance etc . but due to enormous work pressure employee participation is NIL ,  Even people don't get time to attend few HR sessions where they talk about any changes or policies .even your managers will never encourage you for that , But if there are any meeting conducted by your managers manager then your manager will pull you to the meetings to increase the crowd .\r\n- There are 20+12 leaves per year but most of the times managers start cribbing if you take more leaves . this does not happen in US . \r\n- US/Canada offices are better as they have better work , better culture and managers are not like Indian IT managers .\r\n\r\nBottom line is its a good company but a not a best company as believed to be . There are lot of Indian companies now a days who pay similar and also has better work culture and policies . US offices are far better . So if you are looking for job in  Indian office join only if you don't have any options ."}, {"review_title": "Staff Engineer (Software)", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Staff Software Engineer in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Competitive pay\r\n- I got promoted quickly but that really depends on team, I have alot of friends who are very capable but get mired in performance review politics, really hit or miss.", "cons": "- Quality of people who have been here 12-15+ years ago not up to par - probably joined when Qualcomm was growing quickly, makes you wonder how are these guys engineers\r\n- Sweatshop mentality last 3 years+ in QCT (the chip making business).

You will work on modifying legacy spaghetti code to add small new features. You will sit in front of a computer all day, answering never-ending emails and instant messages, in which people can't even properly write, saying things like \"qq R U in\".  Your mind will turn to mush as you quote Q-acronyms all day, and multi-task endlessly. You will click many buttons with your mouse. Is this how you want to spend 9-10 hours per day, 5 days per week?\r\n\r\nTalent is not a prerequisite to work here, despite the propaganda stating otherwise. I believe this to be true for most \"tech companies\", particularly the large ones. You will be trained on Qualcomm's in-house tools and processes, and this will be the primary focus of your job. Anyone could work here.\r\n\r\nQualcomm claims to be an American company but hires very few Americans. Easily >95% of the engineers there are H1B visa holders. Most of the Americans they do hire are contract employees who receive no benefits at all; no vacation, no health insurance, no sick leave, etc. Qualcomm benefits from the American corpitocracy , which is funded by American tax payers, yet provides very little in return to American in terms of jobs. Well, perhaps they indirectly provide more service industry jobs. Also, Qualcomm hides billions of dollars overseas so as to not pay American taxes. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, an IEEE study (and other studies) show that there are plenty of American engineers, meaning very few H1B visas are needed. So, as American colleges spit out more \"STEM\" professionals, with massive amounts of debt, fewer of them will be able to find jobs because of companies like Qualcomm. Who benefits from all of this? The financial sector does. \r\n\r\nKnow that if you work here, you are contributing to the worsening state of things in the world. You are contributing to the increasing wealth gap between the 1% and everyone else. For example, while bonuses for engineers decreased every review cycle I worked there (despite increasing review ratings), executive pay skyrocketed. \r\n\r\nLet's think about what these large corporations like Qualcomm do. They take priceless \"commodities\" (at least in the corporate mind) of human lives and natural resources (plants, animals, minerals), and convert them into pointless gadgets in exchange for worthless currency. This currency has value only because people agree it does. Additionally, corporations exist only because people agree they do. We spend our lives working for a fictitious entity that makes the world a worse place, in exchange for fictitious currency. It is silly. Don't do it. \r\n\r\nIf you don't mind doing tedious mind-numbing work (updating XML and spreadsheets, spending <10% of your time writing code), because you get \"fat\" paycheck, then work here. If you don't mind knowing that you are trading your life away in order to make the rich richer, then you will like it here. I\r\n\r\nAnd, now Qualcomm is laying off 15% of its workforce, and bringing hedge fund members onto the Board. Is this really where you want to work? \r\n\r\nHow about instead, you live an authentic life. Let's quit believing in imagined realities: the corporate people, the fiat currency. Instead, live locally and for each other. Our society worships corporations (imagined constructs) above what is real. Quit doing it, and make the world a better place.

If Qualcomm can't meet their deadlines with people working normal hours, then that's a management issue, not employees not working hard enough.

This company has also done a phenomenal job of convincing the city of San Diego that it is a caring, benevolent, and giving place.

The benefit to employees is that they are able to share some of this limelight, just by working for the company.

Qualcomm credits itself for being like a giant startup, able to nimbly adapt to customer roadmap changes, and this is good, but it makes for an environment that is extremely difficult to penetrate if you were not born at the company. \r\n\r\nQualcomm is like a jungle, and your ability to wield a machete should be at the top of your tool kit. It is a cut throat, back stabbing place where everyone is trying to get credit for things they may or may not actually be responsible for achieving in order to get promoted to the next level. There is very little respect for employees as they are viewed as work horses that need to be and often are, publicly whipped in order to get the last ounce of productivity out of. Qualcomm simply does not care about your work-life balance in spite of the presence of the basketball courts and cafeteria, both designed to keep you on site as long as possible.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest surprises to me, is how atypical the program management role is when compared to the rest of the industry. Program management in Qualcomm is not a position of authority. This job is in the process of changing from a role of assistant to engineering, ie. setting meetings, taking notes, arranging food for lunch, but always remember that it is engineering that calls the shots in this company and that's the way it will probably always be. Senior (director & VP level) program management leadership is nothing short of weak and something of a joke to the other VPs, easily swatted aside, opinions not considered, and in their frustration, often turn around and pass the same treatment along to their reports.\r\n\r\nIn closing, if you are thinking of joining us as a program manager, think again - don't bother, find somewhere else to work, that's what I'm in the process of doing."}, {"review_title": "Great Place to Work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Apr 2010", "job_title": " in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Challenging work, smart and talented co-workers.

IT staff are second class citizens, playing second fiddle to developers and \"real\" engineers.

Since the \"real\" engineers are fairly spoiled, IT is constantly being pulled at their whim with little planning or time to do it right. Highly reactive, which often results in less than optimal IT solutions. Engineers then look down upon IT for providing half-baked solutions, even when we were totally left out of any up-front planning and they need something \"yesterday\". \r\n\r\nCorporate IT is also highly siloed, and people get put in a box and rarely let out. If you are an Exchange administrator, then you have zero insight into storage, virtualization, networking, etc. Or maybe all you do is administer load balancers. Very little cross-discipline training or exposure. This stunts IT skills and IT careers. Everyone has their rice bowls, and getting major tasks accomplished that cross multiple groups is very painful. The helpdesk tries their best, but lacks good training and skilled staff. Extremely high turnover, and not very happy customers. \r\n\r\nBecause the perks and company are good overall, the poor IT performers stay and rarely seem to leave. Getting HR to fire someone is nearly impossible and takes 6-9 months if not more, even if the person clearly is not even remotely performing at their level. HR is highly risk adverse, which causes major pain for staff managers and makes the teams suffer. \r\n\r\nBottom line is if you want to work in IT, don't go to Qualcomm.

Management is terrible in this company. The place is heavily political and hostile. The environment inside the company is dog-eat-dog. For each person who gets a \"good\" performance review, an equal number of people must receive a \"bad\" performance review no matter how well they have done since people performance has to follow a bell curve distribution. This leads to cutthroat internal competition. Backstabbing within the team is encouraged and rewarded. My manager asked me blatantly to spy on my coworkers, find mistakes in their work, and write those things in reports behind my coworkers back since I am popular and respected among my peers. When I refused to do so, he threatened me that he will lower my performance and I will miss a promotion. I tried to look for another group to switch to within the company but failed. Switching groups via IOS is extremely difficult and almost impossible without the help of your manager, so if things aren\u2019t so good between both of you then forget it, you better find job at a different company. \r\n\r\nHR folks are useless and liars, don\u2019t ever think of going to them with a complaint. They will almost always give you the wrong advice and will contact your manager behind your back and tell him that you came to them with a complaint even if they promised it will be confidential. HR department is just there to protect the company from any possible lawsuits; they don\u2019t give a damn about employees. HR is a useless department completely.  \r\n\r\nIf you don't want to get chewed up and spit out - and that can happen at any time - don't work there. The pay, which is below average, and benefits aren't worth the stress; it can make you physically ill. If you want to be a \u201cgood\u201d performer by their standards, you are constantly stressing about being visible, not upsetting the wrong people and trying to stay ahead of your peers by any means, and if you have ethics, generally you don't do well. I know people who have done some truly unbelievable things to get ahead. If you aren\u2019t cool enough then you will be singled out and targeted even by people you don\u2019t work directly with. Be careful; don\u2019t let yourself to be an escape goat for their failure.  People advance in this company by backstabbing and connection with corrupt middle/upper management. You have to be your manager\u2019s favorite pet to get a promotion. A bad manager can really prevent your career growth no matter how well you performed or what other people think of you.\r\n\r\nThe performance review process at Qualcomm is entirely flawed and completely subjective. Managers have the right to veto and override all 3rd-party feedbacks on an employee. They use this to create phony PIPs to eliminate anyone who dares to question their practices. \r\n\r\nThey hire a lot of fresh college grads with PhDs to do menial bench test work and treat them like indentured servants because most of them are foreigners and they need visa sponsorship to stay in the country. Qualcomm likes to hire PhDs straight out of college to make sure that they don\u2019t have previous work experience so they don\u2019t know that the workplace could be better elsewhere, and work them 24/7 in a killing environment. What they say in the interview is completely different from what the actual job is, a lot of sugar coating. The work is boring, repetitive, requires basic programming skills or not at all, copying and pasting. Basically the positions are low level engineering job that a technician with an associate degree can perform, however the internal policy requires that the job is filled with recent grads holding advanced degree. Utilizing your knowledge is frowned upon because that threatens your lead/manager\u2019s image and makes him look weak. Most likely your work will be stolen by your lead.  Managers are unappreciative, insulting and downright rude. If you have a PhD don\u2019t waste your hard gained education or time here.\r\n \r\nForeign nationals in the company from India and China alone constitute more than 90% of the work force (diversity?!!). Those foreigners gang together, speak their own language in meeting rooms, labs, and hallways, and, shamelessly, hire and give promotions to their own kind. They hide work related information and keep the information within. They also gossip and share departments\u2019 internal matters with their buddies in India and China. That creates a hostile environment for people who aren\u2019t racially/ethnically related to the group members or not from the same region/village.\r\n\r\n Mid-level and upper-level management are insecure and totally useless and clueless, they are there just to collect status from the engineers who do the actual work. Those managers create a lot of useless meetings, wasting the engineers\u2019 precious time, while spending the majority of their day resting and vesting.\r\n\r\nThe list goes on and on. That caused a few people to commit suicide by jumping from the 11th floor balcony in San Diego campus. That just shows how horrible the environment is for foreigners to kill themselves in a company that claims to be one of the best 50 companies to work for in the world!

Sounds great in theory, but in practice, this just means you got to do the hard work to convince more people, or one week later, you are sitting through another meeting talking about the same thing.  I rarely see meetings produce to-do list and action items. Most meeting last 30 mins or an hour, even though they really could be shortened.  I\u2019ve seen level 3 engineers\u2019 days being fully booked with meetings, and sometimes double booked, so they better do work during nights and weekends.  But really, the worst part of meetings is mud slinging shouting matches that occur when some features break.  One time we had frequent crash in a handset; it was traced to a watchdog condition.  One of the conditions that might trigger it was a full heap.  So we reasonably asked if the responsible parties could check memory leaks.  I could swear someone was getting bloody murdered by the loud shouting and responsibility deflecting.  Waste of time all around.  \r\n\r\nStodgy, antiquated, monotonous software strategy!  I worked in QIS (Qualcomm Internet Services), a purportedly web services division of the company.  But there was much attitude against integrating emerging practices and technology.  We even had a meeting back in 2013 from legal telling us not to participate in open source forums (not code contribution, but just Q/A forums), not to sign an 3rd party agreements (which effectively means not to download Android SDK, iOS SDK) without informing the legal department first.  Of course, the bigger disappointment is that even when I was leaving, I hardly saw modern practices like continuous delivery, continuous integration, DevOps, continuous testing, etc, etc.  Each handset software release takes weeks in straight waterfall (dev -> test -> integration -> release).  Even with a lengthy schedule, software often ship with major undiscovered bugs.  I used to snigger at the term \u201cfeature complete release;\u201d because it might as well mean crash after 5 minutes.  I feel senior employees at Qualcomm San Diego can really benefit a lot by taking an externship at lean startups and actually learn something about efficiency and process automation.  \r\n\r\nDuplication of efforts.  Where do I begin on this one\u2026  There are often multiple internally developed or internally available tools for you to do the same thing, but good luck to you if you need help setting it up.  To give you an example, I needed to do some integration testing with some QC partner corporations.  One of the tasks is automated dialing and torture testing.  Supposedly there were 3 tools available for me to use.  One was developed by a separate QC division; and it was obviously meant to do some serious heavy lifting.  I couldn\u2019t use it because our liaison couldn\u2019t get the help, and the customization effort to get it to use look into LTE protocol instead of CDMA was high.  Another tool was developed by an outside consulting firm; we couldn\u2019t use it because it didn\u2019t have the right driver.  Yet another internally developed tool was not used for a reason or another I couldn\u2019t remember.   So I had to write a script to do automated dialing.  Just to think, 3 separate groups got credit for developing their tools (and got credit), then moved on, and never thought about supporting them again.  Apparently my experience was not unique.  \r\n\r\nSlow pace of advancement.  As a lot of people have mentioned before, doing hard work for long period of time often don\u2019t get you the advancement.  Fixing software bugs and pushing out new releases from 9AM to 9PM day after day will maybe get you to the next level after 5 years.  Majority of Qualcomm departments are not growing, so your advancement opportunity is limited.  Much of the employees at Qualcomm are pretty young, so advancement through attrition is really not an option.  When I was quitting, I was offered advancement to stay.  This really doesn\u2019t inspire loyalty."}, {"review_title": "Sr. Dir.

The reason why H1B work extremely long hours because Q threatens to not petition for H1B their green card unless they work extremely long hours so Q can get much greater investment return, and therefore there is no reason why they want to hire American workers even at the same price.
