And make you feel like a slave in addition to the hostile environment they provide to you). If you want to join in this company, you better have an experience of 2-3 years and take their senior engineer role. Don't ever take their 'Engineer' or 'Assosciate Engineer' designation\r\n\r\nNow, If you think I am writing this only because of my poor academic profile or having one bad experience in the company. Remove that from your mind. I cracked JEE with a rank below 500(gen. category), and I am one of the topper in my batch during my stay in IIT. And in Qualcomm, I worked in one of the best team (which is a emerging). I have been a crucial cog for some time as well.", "cons": "Caution(freshers -don't join): Don't sway away by their no. 1 position in the processor market\r\n\"From 'making freshers feel hostile or not fit for the role given' to 'giving lots of work on a single day expecting to be like a senior'\" - They do all these to a fresher.\r\n\r\nNow, I am writing this only to caution freshers. They have zero tolerance to you, and once they feel you are lagging in some topic, they have this culture to not assign the work that you are lagging(they don't make you learn. Instead, they expect you to not lag every day, even if you are sick. And you need to fake if you want to be successful). Once they feel that you are bound to move out of the company, even-though it's after an year(u r thinking to move), they stop giving you work and make you feel stupid to be in the company. \r\n\r\nThey will treat freshers with no respect. They will make freshers work like a slave (just like the ancient feudal system, here leads and managers are feudal lords and their juniors are their workers, who are bound to work for their lords). \r\n\r\nFreshers don't stay in this company for more than 2 years. They will get zero knowledge about the industry, if managers feel the fresher is bound to leave in such a manner(Managers will somehow make sure of this by not exposing you to the state-of-the-art). You need to be a fake of yourself to survive in this place (ironically, HRs want employees to be themselves and not a fake). You need to make your manager believe that you will stay in this company for your life-time(literally, lifetime). You need to fake in every meeting that you have understood the presenter's theory. If you question them, if he is your senior, then he will get angry and not give you work. Upper manager don't take you or your work or your ideas seriously. They make you feel you deserve a low-grade work and will take your confidence away.\r\n\r\nI have experienced everything from being a worthless cog to becoming a crucial cog and again becoming a wortheless cog in the team after a while due to some personal reasons. But, one thing I can say is that I faked every minute, every day in this company, and faking in this company is taken as a success trait (for all the employees). As a fresher, my ideas were questioned in an illogical way by my seniors. Though after a while, they implemented the idea, my lead took the credit for implementing it (such an inhumane political act. The culture in this company itself is more political than hardwork. \r\n\r\nCompany lives on hard-workjng people, but gives credit to political people ( from money to power). They will say they are crediting the management, because they are the one's who manages you. And you need to fake that you are in a complete agreement with this view.\r\n\r\nI once again urge freshers(especially IITians) to not join this company. Along with your overall confidence and self-respect, you will also lose your health and will be prone to some life-style diseases (Such a hostile culture for an immature fresher)."}], [{"review_title": "Work Environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Folks who are technically sound and who can challenge you to grow and learn more", "cons": "Politicking here and there that you experience."}, {"review_title": "Qualcomm", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Feb 2021", "job_title": "IT Engineer Lead in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everything is good, work, technology, people , learning", "cons": "Work hours, mostly one has to stretch long hours"}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Systems Test Engineer in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There's good work / life balance.", "cons": "There is one annual review."}, {"review_title": "PDCAD Engineer", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Feb 2021", "job_title": "PDCAD Engineer in Cork", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, rewards, stock program.", "cons": "Poor work-life balance.\r\nWorking with time-zone differences is challenging."}, {"review_title": "Good company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Senior Lead Software Engineer in Chennai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good work-life balance and great opportunities", "cons": "No qualms with the company"}, {"review_title": "Lots of opportunity to make a difference and engage in exciting projects", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "26 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Director, Business Development in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good, smart people.

Instead of adjusting their business model to prevent even further regulatory damages (QC has been slapped with major fines by Korea, China, and the EU to name a few), they insist on continuing with their controversial business model and instead choose layoff thousands of employees once more.
