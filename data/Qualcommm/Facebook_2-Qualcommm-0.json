The number of program managers in Qualcomm could put many startups to shame in terms of headcount. Due to large number of teams & number of software/hardware variants for each product Qualcomm is heavily dependent on program managers for coordination activity. Just too many PMs. Qualcomm has very well defined framework for process, program planning/execution/delivery and it is a matter of time new person becomes familiar with it. Strangely at QC program manager role is technology agnostic and anybody can work on any domain as the focus is mainly on coordination, tools, reports rather than technology & strategy. Mobile business unit is primary and then there are smaller adjacent BUs (auto, compute, IOT) You stop learning after 2-3 years and merely continue doing same work again & again. You need to beat your own drum loudly for every small thing you do to get noticed (you are one amongst many). The whole rewarding scheme within PM org is laughable (you can get awarded for creating a report in xls or onboarding someone). Promotions are managed & not really based on performance (fixed cycle for each grade in most cases) It's all work all the time with aggressive timelines & personal life will be compromised most of the time.
