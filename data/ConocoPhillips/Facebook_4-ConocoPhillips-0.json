The norm for a team is to have an abundance of team members which many get used to being able to take 1.5 hour lunches and leave work before 5pm.

While you may think that I am bitter at CoP for for the loss of my employment, I would have given this same review while employed if I had known about these glassdoor reviews.\r\n\r\nThere is WAY to much focus on playing the game rather than running a business. Employees and more specifically managers are too involved in furthering their career than making good business decisions. From my experience, managers spend more effort building their fiefdom, climbing upward of around than \"managing\" their teams, or actually being a leader.  The CEO Ryan Lance and other exec's want the company to be a nimble aggressive quick mover.  Unfortunately, the system is clogged with managers who are trained in the big company political system, or are bottle necked by another layer of management who just doesn't understand how this new quick to learn and change fast paced industry.\r\n\r\nI know it is a big company and we all hear that every big company is this bureaucratic and this way. But who is saying this?  Have they ever actually worked at another company.  It is an excuse not to try to become better.  The company has lots of potential that is is failing to achieve. I know it will never be perfect and isn't as good as it could be. \r\n\r\nMany employees are not actually good at what they are employed to do.  It surprised in every group I was in how many people didn't actually know how to do their job. These employees have been around for years and never been fired. It is astounding.  And the employees of which I noticed who were good at their job were continuously frustrated. Frustrated by working with these incompetent co-workers or in a system of incompetence. Strangely enough, these skilled workers got frustrated and quit, gave up, or were even laid off.  All while the lesser skilled employees remained.  Many cases it was because it was more beneficial for the said employee to \"play the game\" politically rather than develop their technical skills. This ConocoPhillips culture creates a workforce that rewards the self promoting, deceptive and unskilled, rather than a collaborative, honest, and skilled workforce. \r\n\r\nI know I would still be employed if I had focused not on making better business and technical personal technical improvements, but rather to have spent more time kissing up to my managers, with constant private conversations, taking managers out for lunch and drinks with them, and playing the political game.

ConocoPhillips has too many employees that do not perform well or care about their jobs or their co-workers (they're \"mailing it in\" to get the paycheck) and managers don't deal well with these performance issues.  ConocoPhillips does not always treat people equally and many decisions regarding performance and bonuses are based on the managers discretion.  ConocoPhillips has a lot of bad lower level managers.  ConocoPhillips Canada is to ConocoPhillips USA what western Canada is to Ontario; at election time our votes don't really count.  ConocoPhillips requires that you take global assignments to progress within the company.  It is very difficult to move up in ConocoPhillips and they almost always under value employees in their pay grades and in salary increases.  Many people will leave the company to increase their work station because they can not do this within the company."}, {"review_title": "A recent personal experience of COP, Aberdeen, from the perspective of a young professional.....", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Nov 2012", "job_title": " in Aberdeen, Scotland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunities for further study  \r\n\r\nMost colleagues were friendly and pleasant enough people to work in a team with. \r\n\r\nStrong focus on health and safety \r\n\r\nRegular business updates provided to all staff through large Town Hall meetings \r\n\r\nYearly corporate health challenge which helped to improve morale and team spirit around the office. \r\n\r\nNice office location / surroundings - an area in which those who were keen on keeping fit could walk / jog at lunchtimes\r\n\r\nSome good perks for all employees i.e. free lunches and access to on-site gym facilities and exercise classes.", "cons": "Very poor initial training / handover and induction process on commencing employment with the company. One of the main reasons why I left the company I was employed by prior to starting with ConocoPhillips was that I felt I was not receiving enough guidance, training and development as a new employee and recent graduate. I made this very clear throughout the interview process and was advised that this was nothing to worry about at COP. However, on commencing employment at the company I discovered this to be worse than my previous company had provided and considered myself to be very much thrown in at the deep end and left to my own devices. Further down the line in the role, during a one to one discussion with my supervisor (who had already admitted to a more senior member of my team that the quality of handover and training I had recieved was particularly poor) advised me that they had expected me to \"change\" and \"improve\" more about the role than I had done already. \r\n\r\nPoor and insensitive feedback process following an internal job interview - after being interviewed by management and subsequently failing to be appointed to an internal vacancy against an external candidate, no automatic feedback was provided to me following the interview process. I recieved an email advising me that I had been unsuccessful, which included a link to the corporate external career website. I then had to ask a total of three times via email for interview feedback before this was eventually provided to me - an entire month after the interview. On receipt of the feedback, there was no suggestions or guidance provided on how to improve my interview performance in the future. Furthermore, there was no mention or explanation of the time lapse between the interview and the feedback meeting. I was only advised of the reason why the external candidate was appointed over myself, which was that the candidate could \"inject fresh ideas\" into their department and \"was from a line of work which the department had regular contact with\". \r\n\r\nIt soon became apparent that I had been given false hope / promises at the onboarding stage regarding my future to make the role with the company more attractive. For example, at the inital interview stage with the company I was advised that there was a very strong chance that a new graduate scheme in my line of work which involved some travel to the USA was in the pipeline and was likely to be started within one year of myself accepting an offer with the company. However, the scheme never materialised and I did not recieve any update regarding the progress of the scheme during my two plus years in the role. \r\n\r\nNegative staff morale and a relatively tense atmosphere in general. However, morale levels varied between departments and some departments and teams seemed to have a more positive and enthusiastic disposition than others. \r\n\r\nI felt that there was a culture which made it very difficult for employees to admit that their workload was too large to cope with or that they were struggling with something in particular for fear of being considered weaker in comparison to others or not committed enough to their jobs. This tended to lead to a number of co-workers having to work through lunch hours on a regular basis, stay later in the evening or go into work at the weekends. \r\n\r\nA large number of the supervisory / leadership team were unapproachable and aloof personalities, many appeared to be miserable in their jobs and lacked effective communication and interpersonal skills. \r\n\r\nGenerally cliquey and uninviting office environment (particularly for a new employee) and could take a good while for someone new to settle in. However, again the severity of this differed between areas of the company and it appeared to be down to the luck as to what type of personalities were in your team or department."}], [{"review_title": "Experience has been ok, nothing special", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Feb 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Bartlesville, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- New CEO Ryan Lance seems like he cares more for his employees than Mulva did.\r\n  (example: he did away with Mulva's joke of a forced rankings system)\r\n  (example: he recently raised the bonus target rate for certain salary grades.)\r\n- Good retirement (although not as good as Devon's) and health benefits/insurance.\r\n- 19/30 days (work an extra 30 minutes each day and get one day off a month & doesn't count against vacation days)\r\n -  Good work/life balance", "cons": "- The leadership in my department once told me that we do not make counteroffers to employees that have received a better offer for another company.
