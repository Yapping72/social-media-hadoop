The majority of the Directors are all connected by bonds of friendships which leads to a company wide mechanism of favoritism. Their skills and abilities do not justify their responsibilities, positions, and salaries (the demonstration is also available in the current share price and performance). The overall environment within the company (Grab Indonesia) is described by the vast majority of the employees as toxic and political. Many of them however (including me) decide to close an eye or look the other way to bring home a good salary. 2. The overall performance and results achieved by employees are not nearly as important as the relationships within the company. There are employees who got one promotion after another (I admit, myself included) just because they were closer/people pleaser) to their manager, while others with probably better performances and skills have lagged behind, often being moved around departments to avoid giving promotions. 3. The big lie on layoff avoidance. Whenever the company decides to fire people (regardless whether it is one or multiple individuals at the same time), in order to avoid paying this employee's severance package, they engage in unethical behaviors aimed at damaging the employee\u2019s self esteem and team relationships, which often ends with a resignation. Many competitors engaged in \"mass layoffs\" in 2022, which they mentioned in quarterly reports and was also reported on in general news. Grab did not, in fact it is one of the few players which seemingly did not engage in layoffs. The mantra on the newspaper that Grab uses is always on these lines \u201cNo layoffs despite weaker market\u201d. In reality, Grab\u2019s directors engage in unethical, hazing behaviors to force mass resignations."}], [{"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Marketing Assistant Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They offer a lot of support and collaboration throughout your career with great benefits", "cons": "Could be difficult to adjust to the culture and process"}, {"review_title": "Grab Influencing all to have a hunger culture, and great place for growing for Milenial Generation", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Business Operation Lead in Jakarta", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- The most growing place who facilitate anyone who likes to explore new ideas and create something new - Peers and colleagues are open minded, willing to discuss or having brainstorming to make sure all the work run well - Modern millennial vibes, the culture makes us comfortable and feeling young", "cons": "- high speed of innovation update, sometimes need extra milestones to keep on track - Sometimes grabbers need to do some multi-tasking job such as responding to some issues while we had a meeting etc. Also seems like we have no time boundaries for work - life balance"}, {"review_title": "Great culture!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Market Analyst in Jakarta", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture & employee benefits", "cons": "None so far during my time there"}, {"review_title": "Great Work Quality, WLB, Avg Pay", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Work Quality, Work Life Balance", "cons": "Avg Pay.
