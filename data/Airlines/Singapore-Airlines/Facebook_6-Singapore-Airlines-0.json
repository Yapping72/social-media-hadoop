We are losing many good and capable people because the salary structure simply isn't competitive to what the marketplace is offering. This is worsened in the very high inflation environment we are seeing. It is much more costly to hire replacements, train them well, only to lose them after one or two years because we don't compensate them well enough. Its a great pity. We seriously need to up the compensation structure to attract and retain talent. Further, career progression tends to be slow. Another major bugbear is the relatively ulu and run down location of its offices. The main HQ at airline house is old and very run down. It is in desperate need of major renovations. The offices are spacious but old and drab. The other major offices at STC and TechSQ are slightly better, but not by much more. Location in the far east is a major deterrent, especially for staff living in the north or west given the lengthy commute. To mitigate this, management should consider giving more wfh days and increased flexibility in working hours, or allow staff to work in satellite offices closer to central. Doing so will also give us the opportunity to upgrade or renovate the existing buildings. Food options at the canteens are also dire.

It is also subjected to balloting so you might not even get the flight that you want. Company stinges on cost a lot in a discreet way. China brand stationery, no food and drinks in the pantry (depends on your department), and recently the fluoride treatment in dental appointments even got removed. \r\n3. Pay is definitely below market rate. Fresh grad average $3K starting pay (but varies by a few hundred dollars depending on your honours)\r\n4.  Culture is not good (but really depends on your division). In my division, the managers are old (mostly in their 40s-50s) and closed minded and do not like people to voice out disagreements. You are expected to obide by the rules and procedures strictly. Very inflexible and stifling culture. Also, in the more operational departments, there are a lot of aunties/uncles doing admin work while waiting to retire. It does not make for a motivational and inspirational working environment for the younger generation. \r\nNonetheless, there are many changes going on in the company right now.
