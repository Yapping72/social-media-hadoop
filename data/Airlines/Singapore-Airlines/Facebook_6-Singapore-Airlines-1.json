The management are also very concerned about \"covering ass\", to the extent that it is having very detrimental effects. For example, a lot of managers are starting to not make simple decisions and insisting on senior managers, vice presidents and other higher ranking management making the decision. This takes up a lot of time and does not add any value to the project.\r\nThere is also a lot of backstabbing going on.\r\nOne of the biggest problems at Singapore Airlines is that it does not matter how good you are at your job - as long as you are favoured by the management, you can do absolutely nothing and still get promoted. The reverse is also true - once you fall out of favour with the management, you will continually be bullied and bypassed for promotion even if you work 80 hour weeks and make no mistakes.\r\nThe management is very petty and unreceptive to feedback. Criticism, even when constructive, is taken personally. The management has a record of punishing employees who give feedback that is deemed to be critical of them."}, {"review_title": "Not what it seems", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "12 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Flight Stewardess in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Travel & decent hotels.

The brand name still holds some clout. Somehow people's faces still light up when you mention the company name. It is arguably one of Singapore's strongest brand name.\r\n\r\n2. If you get bored easily doing the same old job, SIA has a strong rotation policy where executive and management gets rotated every 2-3 years to different departments or divisions.\r\n\r\n3. One free air ticket per year to any destination, and unlimited discounted tickets for the rest of the year.\r\n\r\n4. Strong training culture means you get to attend 2-3 days personal enrichment courses every year.", "cons": "1. The air travel industry is a sunset industry due to commodisation of airline seats and services. Airlines all buy the same planes and seats from the same manufacturers. There's really no difference travelling SIA or ANA or Emirates now - whichever gets you there the fastest and cheapest gets your business. For shorter distance, LCCs make even more economical sense.\r\n\r\n2. Yes the brand name is strong but do realise that any experience you gain from the airline industry is actually quite specialised due to the nature of the business. If you want to switch jobs in the future you really need to convince your potential employer why you want to crossover. The usual question is \"SIA is such a strong brand name, why do you want to leave?\" a.k.a. \"Is there something wrong with you?\" Also SIA owns SilkAir, Scoot and Tiger - if you quit from SIA you are basically left with smaller airlines to hop to if you want to stay in the same industry.\r\n\r\n3. Rotation policy can be a bane - imagine you are getting good at your job and getting along well with your colleagues and your boss - then you are asked to switch departments. What if you are allocated to somewhere which you don't like or can't get along with your manager? Constant rotating does not instill a sense of security and belonging. Thus there are good people who actually leave after their second or third rotation after a while. Also, as mentioned by some of the contributors, due to the rotation policy it encourages some bad behaviour like people who are too eager to prove themselves as well as not motivated to solve some structural issues because they are only there for a short time.\r\n\r\n4. Due to intensified competition from other airlines and LCCs and high fuel prices, airlines have to cut costs and do more with less resources. You can sense the tension in the air and everyone's afraid of speaking up against management because they are the ones who know best. Gone are the days of 5-6 months bonus, now 1-2 months is the norm. Promotion is slow and it takes an average to above average performer 10 years to reach managerial status from executive.\r\n\r\n5.

Acted like a know-it-all even though she had no clue about US laws. Some co-workers were equally nasty and toxic. Overall environment very hostile and stressful. There is no safety culture, professionalism, training and tact at all; You will be harassed constantly for doing your job correctly/quietly/following federal laws. Other people's sole responsibilities become yours in addition to your responsibilities leaving you constantly overwhelmed (even on your days off you are harassed). Countless times U.S safety guidelines were violated so that the flight can leave on time; don't understand how or why passengers fly on this carrier as safety procedures were constantly violated (ADA especially). One co-worker who opened the JFK station in early 90s was forced to stand on the ramp in the freezing sub-zero temperatures and freezing rain after receiving chemotherapy as a result of being diagnosed with cancer and was eventually fired. SM made fun of other staff because of their weight/appearance (not professional at all). One duty involved monitoring the ramp and the SM would force staff to stand very close in front of the engine (even though there are safety cones there for a reason; she demanded you stand even closer/past the safety cones); if the pilot accidentally started the engine while conducting their tests before boarding, you're finished. One time on a very hot summer day (90 degrees Fahrenheit), the cleaner fainted on the hot plane parked on the tarmac and the SM didn't want to turn on the A/C (other carriers did) to save money. As mentioned above, service partner staff who do so much for the carrier were treated like garbage. There are other countless incidents that happened that make you wonder how this carrier continues to fly here in US despite countless violations (maybe they bribe the FAA as SQ/Singapore, as stingy as they are, are rich and sadly money is all that matters today to these corrupt organizations even if principles/laws are violated). Training is non-existent (the same system used here was learned from working at a true world-class international airline which I left due to being part-time only and very soon regretted leaving to come here; I really learned nothing working here except that this experience was a living hell). Yes, nasty passengers are everywhere but SQ has some of the most disgusting, nastiest passengers you could ever deal with. Even one passenger told me that Qatar is far better (it consistently wins Skytrax airline of the year) than SQ and said that the latter is very cheap (his words, not mine!). Pay is a joke (.07 cents is added to your salary per hour after a year if you're lucky) and flight benefits are equally horrible and useless (can only fly on SQ; no interline agreement at all w/other carriers). Working here is basically indentured servitude or glorified slavery; it destroyed my passion for working in aviation completely and made me leave the industry for good. Worst experience ever; absolute waste of time working here. You will have no self-esteem left after working here.
