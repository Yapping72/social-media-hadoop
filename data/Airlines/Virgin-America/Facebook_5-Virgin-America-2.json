The main things are they hire incompetent people to work for them because they care more about personality and looks than they do about how you can perform the job.  A lot of the people they hire at Virgin have strong personalities which causes a \"too many cooks in the kitchen\" atmosphere with strong opinions going left and right and nothing gets agreed upon or accomplished.  They like to hire inexperienced leadership, people with no experience to lead a team who have no social skills.  They promote egocentric people who get big heads after attaining a position of power.  On top of that the company itself is disorganized and they care more about doing what the passenger wants to be happy than abiding by company policies and procedures to make money.  Policies and procedures are inconsistent among the entire company as rules aren't ever consistently followed.  They aren't doing what they should be to be an airline that will be around for much longer.  Career growth/opportunities are null unless you want to relocate to corporate.  There is no growth for you at any of the airports.  If you want to come here for further career opportunities, think again because there won't be any unless you want to move to expensive San Francisco.  On top of that, compensation is low, benefits are not good like other airlines, senior leadership say they care about each of you, they don't."}, {"review_title": "Good temporary experience", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Jul 2015", "job_title": "In Flight Teammate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Being able to travel anywhere was an amazing benefit, crews were fun and easy going to work with, having good seniority would get you the schedule you want (for the most part).

There was so much grey area that even a supervisor didn't understand the work rules when I would bring up a work rule to their attention over a specific issue. There is very little room for growth. I left the company feeling very unappreciated. The management team always bloats about how Virgin America is the top airline and thanks us for it but doesn't treat their teammates like they're number one, especially in PAY. In the more recent times, there has been very little flexibility in scheduling due to low reserve coverage. If you call out sick, you are required to bring a doctors note, which made me feel like I was in a child in grade school again and it felt as if management did not trust us. They made promises and failed to keep them, especially when the company went public. Also, reserve life for inflight teammates is the worst.

You have zero flexibility here, unless it's a lucky day, and pretty much only at the SFO base. Vacation pay for us is worth 17 hours. We don't even have 4 day trips worth that credit. The only consistency here is inconsistency.

Each and everyday is different and faced with different challenges. Never a dull moment.\r\n\r\nI will give Virgin credit that after much internal criticism they did put together a \u201cWork Rules Advisory Committee.\u201d However, the committee has little confidence among GSTs as it is only advisory and many of the changes were already in the pipeline long before the committee was formed and do not address the core problems with the workplace culture. I will give them credit for trying on the committee but it is basically to tame the inevitable GST unionization.", "cons": "During my time with Virgin America, I tried so hard to like the company and rally around the brand but its breakdown in upper management, the naivet\u00e9 HQ, culture of favoritism, and its cult of personality made it impossible.  \r\n\r\nVirgin has a great reputation externally but internally it is a category five disaster. Besides the below industry pay, lack of career growth, and breathtaking favoritism, Virgin America\u2019s biggest problem is the disconnect between HQ and the stations. Each city runs as its own company with each having its own standards and policies. Those who work in California live in a bubble and it is worse the further you go. \r\n\r\nFor as small as Virgin is it can\u2019t seem to get consistency. The GST Polices and Procedures have really done a big disfavor to the company as they write rules in a very complex and confusing way. Even if the rules are clear they are loosely enforced. HQ is bleeding with inexperienced individuals who truly don\u2019t understand or want to understand the nature of the operation or the roles of others.  Virgin even has a policy that GSTs must get the permission of a manger or supervisor before the call of the police for any reason. This was even after the LAX shooting in our own terminal. My 5-year-old nephew knows to call 911 immediately in an emergency and not ask Mommy or Daddy for permission. \r\n\r\nAt first I thought Virgin was so edgy and innovative but that only lasted so long. It seems as if Virgin is stuck in 2007 and lacks vision to move into the future. In addition, every time you are in a group or in training all you hear is how Virgin is the best and how all our competitors suck. They force the Kool-aid and it turned into somewhat of a bully culture how they praised themselves by constantly bringing others down. Virgin will say how unique and special they are but when convenient they will revert  \u201c this is industry standard\u201d when it comes to cutting health benefits or not raising pay.\r\n\r\nMy best advice is to keep a low profile and avoid stepping in the drama and corruption. After a certain point you may start acting like the child they treat you but still try to lay low. If you find yourself getting a seat at the table and being liked by your local managers, great! You have managed to do what many cannot. You will not be subject to the work rules and will have many exceptions made on your behalf. However, if that is not the case, I would use them like they use you and when a better job comes along\u2026.leave. This is not a career. Please, please don\u2019t fall into the pit many do by holding out for advancement only to find yourself doing the same thing five years later and only having a pin to show for it."}, {"review_title": "Analyst", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Analyst in Burlingame, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people and the environment make Virgin America the best company to work for.

They started with a blank sheet of paper and has pretty much done everything they could do wrong in managing people, and done it in a big way.\r\n\r\n- Favoritism is rampant... snitch on a coworker? Well you just got a promotion!\r\n- Airlines are built on seniority, just like any other blue collar job. At VA, there are many examples in the Pilot and ITM ranks of seniority violations. Without a union, or honest management, there is nothing you can do about it.\r\n- The much vaunted \"open door policy\" that is talked so much about before you come on board or when you are new, is bunk. They don't want to hear your opinion or new idea. You end up being told that you don't understand the complexities and thanks but no thanks.\r\n- Management targets employees, threatens, intimidates, etc. Some of these managers are gone, but we have some new ones that still do the same.\r\n- Company will actually pay you to quit. They talk about building a family, a team. But what team will pay a member a portion of their salary to no longer work there after they are no longer useful to them? ITMs have had opportunities to get \"bought out\" after five years in exchange for resignation. \r\n- Pay is woefully under industry average. Pilots are 15-30% under industry average, ITMs (Flight Attendants) are even less.\r\n- Crew policy manuals are a \"guideline\" that is changed frequently to suit the company's needs.\r\n- Managers are able to apply any kind of punishment they feel necessary. Companies of this type generally have a roadmap, or a chain of events set forth so that all parties can see what can happen given a situation. Not at VA, managers can do whatever they want. If you are a favorite, then great, if not... \r\n- Company says money is tight and that they can't afford to pay standard rates for the industry, yet they spend money like drunken sailors (no offense to any sailors out there). Parties for the favorites are common. Company holds a yearly reprogramming seminar over two days called \"Refresh\". Takes two months, all employees MUST attend. Hotels, food, drinks, vouchers... all provided by the company. What do we do during this session? Let's see, ball room dancing, putting on car tires, assembling food (not cooking) in the theme of Iron Chef or something similar, act in skits, bang on drums.
