The answer is right under their noses but they are not able to take action due to it intertwine to their own fate.\r\n\r\nYour top management are management trainees from Swire who spend their whole like in this rotation programme learning from people beneath them, therefore even when they have become old adults e.g. 40s, their mindset is still like a student, thinking of how to score an A to get a better next rotation. They do so by taking credit of their subordinates' work (who are local based employees) as they do not possess experience and skillsets to actually do real work that contributes to the company. When things go bad, they find a scapegoat, usually someone reporting into them.\r\n\r\nThis does makes you wonder what kind of management training they are getting in this very expensive lifetime programme where one never gets graduated and poor performers are simply dumped in outports (any roles not based in HKG), instead of being managed out. \r\n\r\nTheir accommodation, bills, cars etc are all paid by Swire, which they take for granted like a fully sponsored lifetime holiday. Since they enjoy almost 100% savings of their salary from not having to pay for key things like housing mortgage that a normal person would, they are insensitive to employees needs in times of crisis, such as paycuts, and job security.\r\n\r\nWhile they are a few that are good, majority, especially the ones who have been long breed into this programme have extremely backward management style (e.g. supervising by time in the office instead of deliverables, not open to use of basic technology like ms calendar ), discriminatory towards locals (they have a narrow minded believe that only foreigners are good and can be promoted so top talent locals keeps leaving the organization), and disregard for the law (they still operate like the mindset of emperors in the 18 century and think they have supreme power such that anyone must kowtow to them and any one who disagrees them even if its done professionally and in best interest of the company, is sent for execution). This also why it is so hard for them to innovate and grow..\r\n\r\nThe company says they are trying to be progressive, but alot is lip service and diplomatic answers with no real actions and commitment.
