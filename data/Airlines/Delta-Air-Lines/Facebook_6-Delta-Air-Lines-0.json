As a ready reserve (RR) you do not get raises after your first year, you receive no medical or dental insurance, and no paid benefit time such as sick, vacation, or holiday. You are mandated to work no more than 1400 hours a year on a fixed schedule, which changes every 6 months. My station mandates that all RR agents work that 1400 hours a year so finding a FT job to work around the twice a year changing schedule is nearly impossible. Also, if flights are delayed and you work an afternoon shift, you are mandated to stay (sometimes many many hours) until your delayed flight takes off. This will interfere with any secondary job or obligations you have outside of your part time job with Delta. Delayed flights happen daily so YES, it will definitely happen to you and repeatedly.  I have seen FT positions be filled in a way which is not accordIng to policy or seniority. The culture and values that the company says they have are often quite different than what I see happening at my station with management. My station has a high management turnover. In my short 2.5 years of being there, there is not one general manager, nor operating service manager,  that was there when I started.

Many employees are happy to work as many hours as are needed to support the operation & their co-workers, but (manager-dependent) this isn't broadly expected of employees.  In most areas (again, manager-dependent), employees are frequently reminded that family & personal life come first.  The politics are sometimes difficult to fully ascertain and navigate (as with any company), but with proper coaching & mentoring it is navigable; coaching and mentoring is relatively easy to come by given how friendly & caring most employees are.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are overall very good.  Health insurance c. 2020 is relatively affordable and definitely provides comprehensive coverage options (including life, dental, eye, etc.).  Flight benefits are nice to have, but have limitations as the company continues to optimize load factor; however, HR has finally started to realign base salaries higher to reflect the flight benefits' decrease in value over time.  The 401k program includes a 6% match & 2% additional DL contribution (so you contribute 6% from your check and your account receives 14% total), as well as provides financial advising/planning opportunities, and many other benefits focused on the overall wellbeing of employees.", "cons": "Delta's core operation is very much a 24/7 in-person operation (pilots, FAs, mtc, ops control, etc.).  Therefore, most of the divisions supporting Delta's operation do not look kindly upon remote work.  Most operations divisions only allow remote work when the employee cannot come into the office for a specified reason (illness, snow, etc.), and those days are few and far between, and must be arranged day-by-day with your manager.  IT is by far the most flexible with allowing ongoing work-from-home opportunities, but still only allows employees to work from home 2 days per week (these policies are as of March 2020, and before COVID-19 isolation mandated WFH for all nonessential employees).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the bureaucracy surrounding any changes (especially technology-related) is highly burdensome (as with any very large company).  Some technology-related processes which should be smooth, automated, and/or quick (e.g. login requests, new hire laptop requests, etc.) take a very long time (when I first started with Delta as an analyst, i.e. needed a computer to do my job, I didn't have a laptop for the first 2 weeks, this was in 2010).\r\n\r\nAgain, as with any large company, middle/low management is a big problem in some divisions.  executive expectations are very high (as they should be); in some divisions, directors & managers absorb the stress well and direct their teams in a less stress-inducing way, but this is not the norm by-and-large.  Typically directors & managers directly pass the stress onto individual contributors (who don't have sufficient power or influence to fully solve the problems) without sufficiently helping/coaching them on what they can specifically do to help achieve a broader goal up to executive expectations.  This is compounded when divisional goals are not aligned; this is especially problematic with IT focused on project funding & system uptime whereas the rest of the operation is focused on sustainability, reliability, innovation & customer experience.\r\n\r\nWhile the Delta family is great, the way Delta handles the releasing of contractors is abhorrent (in relation to how much we brag about the greatness of the \"Delta family\").  I have been a full time employee for my entire tenure, but have experienced many contractors who were great but may have needed coaching on one small thing who were unceremoniously fired (some over the phone, some just by notifying the contracting company that the person was no longer welcome at Delta, etc.) and escorted off campus immediately (with no advance warning and no opportunities to work on any performance issues they may have had).  This has also been demonstrated by (unfortunately necessary) the immediate laying off of *all* contractors not essential to the operation (about half of the IT division) in the wake of COVID-19 revenue impact.  Understand the need to cut, but I would think Delta would care a little bit more about the health & wellbeing of these people long-term (given that many of their contracting companies do not), especially given that some of these contractors are highly-productive, highly-contributing, members of our workforce, and many of them are SMEs for the work they do."}, {"review_title": "Customer service agent Dtw", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The ability to travel the world which I'm grateful for because my family is in the us.

If you are aiming for a full time Delta career, then working as a ready reserve will start you down the path to full time.  But be aware- it could take YEARS (10 plus, at my station).  If you are willing to relocate, it might take less time.  Delta is good to their full time employees.  They get decent benefits, pay and vacations - time off to enjoy their flight benefits.  Unfortunately, much of the full time benefits are paid for by denying a huge part of the workforce any benefits at all.", "cons": "Ready reserves, Delta's part time un-benefited workers, are the Cinderella's of Delta.  They work more days a year than the full time employees who have all the benefits.  They get 1 week of unpaid vacation a year, while full time employees get paid vacations starting at 2 weeks, after 1 year of employment, 3 weeks after 5 years, etc,....  A ready reserve with 15 years of service still only gets 1 week of un- paid vacation.  It is almost impossible to use the benefits.  Trading shifts is allowed, but it's difficult to cobble enough time to travel very far and stand-by flights are risky.  You have to be able to get back in time for work.  Planning a family vacation is impossible, because trading is only approved 30 days in advance at most, so you can't pay for a cruise, co-ordinate family members vacations, get a deal on a resort, because you won't know if you will get the time off until 30, or usually less days, before.  Full time employees don't have this problem.  Their generous paid vacation weeks allow them to plan up to a year in advance.  Ready reserves work the same schedule as full time 40 hours a week employees.  Their shifts are shorter.  But they work 5 days a week, with no flexibility.  Ready reserves used work 3 or 4 days a week and have some flexibility, which is why workers stayed with the job.  The flexibility made up for the lack of benefits and allowed people to have a second job or time for school or family.  Now that is impossible and most quit within the first year.  Delta has a very low retention rate for ready reserves, which is a disservice to the customers, because there are constantly high numbers of inexperienced employees training.  If you want a part time job and plan to use the flight benefits, go to Southwest or American.  You will get some benefits and be be treated more fairly.   For those wondering why I am still currently employed at Delta;  all airlines are seniority based, for scheduling shift times, etc...   I kept hoping things would get better, but the opposite has happened, except for a  pay scale change.   I have 8 years with Delta and don't want to start all over at the bottom again.

No, they don't have showers, no they don't have beds,(what call center does???) YES we slept on chairs pushed together, floors, and I even saw someone on the treadmill sleeping. I was stuck there for 3 days because Atlanta didn't have snowplows or salt trucks! My son was a yr old I think and still nursing. It was rough on all of us. They got a few(yes a FEW) HOTEL ROOMS NEARBY BUT EVERYONE COULDN'T GO OF COURSE Delta's a 24 hr company. Oh and we got unlimited candybars and chips along with 2 meals a day(breakfast sandwiches from McDonald's across the street and pizza at night) I don't eat pork at all so of course I ate popcorn,and candy for those days.

Some of those days I couldn't talk and other days I was so out of it from the meds that my fianc\u00e9 would take the phone and finish the calls for me. I've been physically assaulted while working there, verbally abused and threatened by passengers on the phones and the whole time I had to try and \"smile through my voice\" Crazy right? the last couple of years, a lot of great people I know have been fired due to whatever Delta deems \"unethical\" but physical violence and sex in the building gets a pass. Look, I held all this in for a long time so sorry if I'm rambling but glassdoor asked so I gave.

It wasn't until a year  in that I started to see through it all.  \r\n\r\nEmployee morale is at an all time low. You are used and abused every single day. You work 12-14 hour days with no breaks, constant abuse and bullying from passengers, and in horrible disgusting work conditions. When you are reaching the 15 hour duty limit, you are entitled to walking away but most of us were bullied and threatened into staying. Say goodbye to ANY holidays with family at home ever again. Even memorial day, labor day, etc. During the summer you are forced to be constantly away from home as you work 100+ hours. One months this summer, I was home only 5 days, and that was without picking up any extra trips. \r\n\r\nYou are punished for being sick. The company literally says they \"expect\" you to only be sick twice a year. Is this a joke? We work on disgusting, never cleaned airplanes filled with bacteria while passengers are coughing, sneezing, vomiting, all day long. We hardly ever sleep, and when we do, it is often interrupted by phone calls from crew scheduling. The long days, lack of sleep deprivation, and no breaks are incredibly hard on our bodies and unhealthy. But we can never get sick?? Oh and good luck seeing a doctor when you ARE sick, as Delta proudly boasts the worst health insurance in the industry. Every single time I picked up prescriptions, the pharmacists were embarrassed to tell me the cost, or often whispered it to me. They have told me that they never see costs this high, and when they do, it is with someone who doesn't even HAVE insurance.  \r\n\r\nThe passenger behaviour has gotten OUT OF CONTROL. This behaviour and this entitlement was single handedly created by Delta!! I showed up to work every single day on time, in my three years there I  only called out sick four times. I came  to work, I was kind and respectful to passengers , and all I received in return was constant abuse and disrespect from the passengers and company. Passengers would write in making up stories about you that never happened, hoping they'd get some kind of compensation. You'd be called in to talk to your manager about the write up and then you'd be punished for something that never happened!! The company NEVER had your back. Welcome to the \"family\" !!! \r\n\r\nThe company will lie to you day in and day out.  We are \"innovation, expanding, fixing, improving. \" Delta was never doing any of those thing. Its no wonder the staffing problems have gotten out of control, because all of the flight attendants are calling out sick. Why? Some of them are actually sick. Most of them just WANT TO BE HOME and do not want to work because of how horrible the conditions have become! The trips have gotten worse and worse. The duty days are longer and longer, and without a union and contract things will only continue to get worse!!\r\n\r\nI left before I had to stand by and watch the company fall to pieces. You are nothing but a number here. All of us KNOW  what is happening, some are turning a blind eye, too afraid to speak up. If you speak up and ask for respect and fairness, you are punished. Many are finally opening their eyes and waking up to the constant abuse and disrespect from the company.

However, it is based on who you know.  I pursued my master's degree while at Delta and was given a hard time to even get a day off for my graduation in my department.  I was told I go to the university of Delta and my schoolwork comes second.  This was by a lead agent no less.  Once complaining to the manager,  nothing was resolved.  Lower management is very resentful over those who get advanced degrees and then leave Delta to pursue  a real career.  The pay is awful and they claim it's industry standard.  It is not. Southwest workers make more and Jet blue workers top out faster.  It will take you ten years to go from 12 dollars to 20 dollars as a csa.  Also,  holidays are hit or miss.  Either you get lucky and your bid coincides with the day off or you will not be seeing your family on the holidays until you accumulate 3 to 4 years seniority more years for closed departments.  All in all, Delta was what I needed to get through college. I loved Delta but the same was not reciprocated with the management they place in charge.  Don't get stuck as a csa for life,  move around a lot or use the position as a way to get through college and your advanced degree.  Also,  the CEO is on a board for united Healthcare.

Many of these issues negatively affected our work performance. Sadly, management simply never put in much effort to fix many of the issues. Some issues were addressed and fixed but not very many. Trying to get a hold of managers was almost nearly impossible. On many occasions, if we were lucky, it took a couple weeks to get an email response. Some managers abuse their work authority, are unprofessional, and often harassed employees. A few were actually caring and helpful....even were experiencing the same issues as us gate agents because their managers were disorganized and unreliable. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I put in my 4 weeks notice to pursue a full-time career elsewhere. About a week before I was scheduled to leave, a manager asked if there was any chance I could maybe stay at Delta as a ready reserve once I was settled into my new job. I ended up being placed on a company leave of absence with Delta, so this way I could easily come back to work part-time once I was comfortable with my new job. Well....Delta did not keep their word. MSP management ended up saying I was never put on a leave of absence, and that I was not allowed to return unless I reapplied. \r\n\r\nThis right here is a great example of how Delta can be unreliable and disorganized."}, {"review_title": "Would have liked it better if they treat employees better.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Oct 2011", "job_title": "Sales", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great workplace, great benefits, incentives are very good, time of, plenty of over time.

I was hired in the middle of the merger and had to train for northwest AND delta policies.  By the time I was put on the ramp Northwest policies were out.  Had they used my training time to learn Delta things I would have been more trained for the position but because I wasn't I was scolded if I did not know how to do something.  \r\n\r\nAlso, when I was hired I was told my life partner would be able to use my domestic partner benefits since I was gay.  BUT as soon as I left for a little vacation they changed it and then I HAD to pay them back for the plane ticket of hers which came out of my LAST check but not before then.  NOT friendly with benefits there.\r\n\r\nBack to when I started.  When I started there were around 20 other employees.  A month or so into it they kept hiring and hiring because of this my hours went from 40 a week to 7.  How can I pay for gas in my car to get to work, to work?  They only allowed 4 full time slots to which went to who had more senority.  \r\n\r\nWhen I began my employment I had some severe health issues which I brought to my managers attention.  I was told that as long as I gave them notice of my appointments it would be approved and not marked as an unexcused absence.  About 3 months into my employment I found out I had Lymphoma.  I informed my manager that I would be under going surgery in a matter of weeks and needed to take it easy as the doctor had ordered(Which I had a note saying so)  They (my manager AND a regional manager) told me that I could not work light duty at the ticket counter.  Even though there were numerous times when someone hurt their back they would allow them to do light duty at the counter until they felt better which sometimes was weeks.  So my options were to either resign and POSSIBLY get my job back after surgery or suck it up and risk my life to work for them.  Obviously I chose my life for me and my son over their selfish needs.  What really makes me mad about this, is when I went and had surgery I was told I was a very close call.  I was on the verge of having Stage 3 Lymphoma which would put me in the survival rate of 55%.  75% if surgery was successful and if Chemo worked.  \r\n\r\nI was treated so horribly I would spit in their face if I saw them again.
