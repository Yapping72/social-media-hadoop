Local talents are in abundance and they still try to hire foreign talent during this pandemic. The previous batch sees 0 hires after spending millions, and here we are with the second batch and a third batch looming large. WHAT's THE POINT? Employees questioned this project and suggestions and complains fell to deaf ears. The whole of HR kept quiet but majority, if not all, disagree with this project \r\n\r\n2) HR being treated like slaves and admins, although our works are essential and important, we can only take orders from business as they are making money for the company, and we have to serve them, fulfill their needs, accommodate to their request, because if we dont, the head of business will complain to the big boss, and we end up getting lectured, for free. (EG: Recruitment spent God-Knows-How-Much-Money on a new recruitment platform, striving to go digital with recruitment processes. But still recruitment team are sending CVs offline, via email, all under the request of business) so my question is, why bother on-boarding a new technology when you cant leverage on it?\r\n\r\n3) You have a great idea, a good suggestion, a brilliant thought, and all goes down the drain. Your idea wont be accepted if you are not close to the senior leadership team. Period.\r\n\r\n4) Those who are close to the leadership team (not all of them) , are extremely cocky. They scold employees, creating a toxic environment, all because of the fact that they reports directly to the big boss. Especially those who are with the big boss for a LONG PERIOD of TIME. They will ignore your message, purposely ignoring your calls and refuse to extend assistance, will not respond to you even though you greet them physically, and most importantly, they BACK-STABBED you. (I want to clarify that there are still a lot of hardworking, young and respectful kind souls who are also close to the BIG BOSS. )"}, {"review_title": "good company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Store Officer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "all good , great place to work", "cons": "nothing more all good to work"}, {"review_title": "Great place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great for personal and career growth, good colleagues", "cons": "Sometimes management give last minute announcement.
