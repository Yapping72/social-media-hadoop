This lasts about a month and is M-F. On the job training follows for about another month where you gain exposure to all the shifts you may work. \n\nSchedule is immensely flexible once you are released from training. You can trade with coworkers and double shifts to get more time off. Shifts are 6am-2pm, 2pm-10pm and 10pm-6am. Schedule is seniority based, meaning the longer you are here, the more likely you are to get your desired shifts. \n\nTime off good. Basically 3 weeks of paid time off with an option to purchase another week. Time off is also seniority based. Expect to work holidays for a while after getting hired. \n\nCoworkers and management are mostly helpful when you have questions or concerns. \n\nThis is a stepping stone to other departments at United. Keep that in mind when you read the cons. \n\nNot a con but something you need to be aware of. You are locked in to this department for one year. If you choose to move up to Coordinator, that year resets. If you don\u2019t want this ensure you get it in writing from HR. But good luck with that.", "cons": "A lot of duties and responsibilities are left out of the job description. For instance, once released from training, you are expected to train other new schedulers. Not sure why the company thinks this is a good idea. The amount of workload is generally high enough to keep a new scheduler busy let alone having to also worry about training somebody. Even if you are uncomfortable with training, they appear to not care. Very bad look when you are doing your first on the job training shift and your trainee says \u201cI don\u2019t like training.\u201d Mind you, there are plenty of schedulers who like to train. Perhaps the company can work with those schedulers instead of forcing new schedulers to train. \n\nSecondly, there are a copious amount of operational issues that are left alone simply because \u201cthat is how it is done\u201d. I won\u2019t get into details but know that these issues make this job more difficult. \n\nThird, as an employee, it is not my job to ensure the company pays me properly for the shifts I work. Yes, you read that right. I have to take time out of my day to ensure I get paid correctly. If you work a PM or MID shift, or any overtime, you have to ensure it is loaded into one of the many cumbersome systems that some pencil pusher though was a one size fits all solution. Mind you, all of our shifts are loaded into a scheduling platform (RosterApps). One would think that the information in RosterApps could just feed to payroll. But apparently that makes too much sense. They choose to pull managers out of the operation to audit this system. Yep. Good business decision. Oh, and even if it is completely right, they will still manage to over or underpay you. \n\nFourth, be prepared for about four different answers when you ask a question. I had an operational issue recently that several people insisted was ok, yet no one could provide me an answer as to why it was ok. Even our scheduling software seemed to agree with my analysis of the issue. \n\nFifth, upper management does not care about retention or employee morale. During the pandemic United moved most of its operations personnel to a work from home model. Over two and a half years, and seemingly no disruption (in fact the company CEO even touted the employees for record setting performance) the company is terminating its work from home option for operational staff. After multiple meetings where we expressed our disappointment with the decision we were told \u201cwell its always been the plan to return, so thats what we are doing\u201d. What a sorry excuse. Especially given how flexible you have to be for the company. \n\nThe technology is subpar to say the least. Its typical antiquated airline computer software. Lots of manual typing of commands and very quirky. Its amazing the airline  runs on it. To be fair, they are updating it to a more modern system, but that will be a 5+ year endeavor."}, {"review_title": "Fliexible hours and good lifestyle for travel lovers", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "28 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Flight Attendant in Tung Chung", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "schedule is flexible, you can trade and drop, pick up your trips.", "cons": "the HK base is no longer exsisted."}, {"review_title": "Year one pay rate", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Flight Attendant in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "$28.88 per flight hour (hours on plane after door is closed until it parks back at the gate) $2/hour additional for each flight hour when you are a \u201cReserve\u201d $2/hour for all hours when you are away from your base", "cons": "Need new flight attendant contract since ours expired at the end of 2021"}, {"review_title": "Flight attendants", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Flight Attendant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can wait to visit new places and meet new people", "cons": "Just won\u2019t have time and I\u2019m going to miss my family"}], [{"review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Ramp Service Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free flights, room to grow in career and friendly work environment.

From the beginning of training trainers, supervisors, and management use scare tactics, fear mongering, and lies as apart of your introduction to United Airlines. You are constantly reminded that you are disposable, that if you make a mistake you will be terminated, and that if you are hurt during your probationary period (180 days or 6 months) you will be terminated. Employees are asked to screenshot or take photos of daily assignments as a matter of precaution to be able to \"verify what you are saying is the truth should there be a discrepancy or an error on managements part*. Management prohibits trainers from having any sort of positive or healthy working relationship with the employees that are being trained. The expectations, risk of bodily injury, and liability of an employee in this position are not at all proportionate to compensation. For newer employees to earn a livable wage requires them to spend as much time working as possible. There is no work-life balance with this position if you need to earn a livable wage. The culture on the ramp is outdated, racist, misogynistic, and homophobic. The level of gross negligence warrants outside intervention; On Saturday October 1st 2022 at Ohare international airport a recently hired ramp agent being directed by a tenured lead ramp agent transferred human remains from an aircraft with passenger bags to a claim belt. Human remains then made its way to a claim area accompanied by passenger bags accessible to the public. Ramp agents were then forced to to retrieve the human remains from the claim area and return them to the ramp. With any position there is a level of \"advertising\" from recruiters. Below is a list of promises made by recruiters vs reality. 1. You will be able to create your own schedule and you will have every weekend off. For the first 6 months you are on United's schedule, wether you are part time or full time you will work 5 days a week. you have no control over your schedule until after your 6 month probation is over. You do not get every weekend off, during your training (approximately 8 weeks) you get weekends off, after training you get 2 weekends off every other month. Additionally, while you can technically create your own schedule by picking up or giving up hours, other people have to take your shifts, ultimately everything comes down to a bidding process where the more tenure you posses the more likely you are to have a schedule you desire. 2. After your 6 month probation has ended you are eligible to apply to any position within United, wether ranging from becoming a flight attendant to working in their corporate office. Granted you must also qualify for the position. The period is not 6 months it is 12 months. 3. United is flexible and willing to work with your schedule. For the first 6 months you are on United's schedule, and there are very few exceptions. Employees have been barred from making early exits from their shifts in the case of family emergencies. 4. The culture of United is that of a family. (see initial statement) In conclusion this is by far the worst orginzation I have been employed with over the course of my adult life."}], [{"review_title": "Toxic environment", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Ramp Agent in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flight benefits Schedule Flexibility Nothing else", "cons": "Toxic environment Supervisors favoritism (Nepotism) Overwork Extreme weather conditions"}, {"review_title": "low morale-too stressful", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "9 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work/life balance if you can get people to trade with you.
