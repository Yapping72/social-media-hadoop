However, you won't get a promotion unless someone in the \"in crowd\" really favors you or you put in long years.  It's a good ole boy company and isn't changing.\r\n\r\nSouthwest is a great place to start if you aren't pursuing higher education. Many leaders only have a high school education and few with bachelor degrees.  I believe the reason for that is many of the leaders started years ago and the good ole boy system worked for them. I believe Southwest tends to promote those without degrees so that they can keep salaries lower for their leaders that never attended college and their leaders stay with the company for long periods of time because no other company will want them without the degree.  This keeps Southwest Airlines costs lower and keeps turn-over down as well.  Southwest does however have a very good 401K match.", "cons": "The leadership lacks higher education so don't expect them to value your higher education. The lack of educated leaders is the most frustrating part about working at Southwest. I expect my boss to understand concepts and data that I present to them. I actually expect my boss to not only understand the difficult concepts, I expect them to be able to teach me something I don't already know. Every leader I have come in contact with has difficulty with advanced concepts, but they also do not possess degrees beyond high school education. Why be innovative if the leaders can't either comprehend or entertain your ideas? As a result, I never felt challenged. \r\n\r\nThe pay was quite a bit lower than the nation-wide average for my job. Recently, I was offered positions at three other companies that paid between $20,000-$25,000 a year more than what I was making. I started off as a intern at Southwest and was offered a job with them. I stayed for three years and wanted to stay longer, but the company was underpaying me and couldn't challenge me. In fact, my Manager accidentally left a piece of paper in my cube with the salaries of everyone in my department. Some of the worst performers were making ridiculously good money and some of the best performers were making terrible money. The employees making the best money had been with the company 15 plus years and those making terrible money were newer employees. Talent and hard work was not rewarded.\r\n\r\nWhen I turned in my two weeks notice, all of the leaders and fellow employees that were singing my praises turned ice cold. I realized that I had been accepted into the \"in crowd\" at some point and was possibly being groomed for a promotion years down the road. Once I turned in my notice, I felt how it was to no longer be in that crowd.  Rumors started up about me, leaders and co-workers became icy or gave me the silent treatment. Leaders who once praised my stellar work started to act like it was shoddy.  I lost a lot of people who I assumed were \"friends\". Turnover is really low at Southwest and it's considered almost offensive if you leave. \r\n\r\nThe last complaint I have with the company is headquarters disconnect with employees out in the field. I worked at headquarters and it was easy for me to see. The department I worked in should have been dispersed out into the field, but instead it was headquartered.  This department lived in their own world and had little to no insight on the day-to-day happenings at the stations, yet it created all the rules the stations needed to follow. I truly believe in 5-7 years Southwest will go through bankruptcy due to several factors.  I think they are putting band-aids on some issues that need desperate repair. The quarterly earnings might be doing good now, but the band-aids won't hold things together forever.   I believe Southwest is headed for bankruptcy mostly because of the disconnect between management and the union, the isolation of headquarters, the lack of good quality leaders, and talent that continuously leaves because of reasons mentioned above.

Definitely an old boys club, and they have each other's back, even when they know that they are wrong....maybe if there were more women/people of color at the Manager/director level, this is a problem that wouldn't happen.  There is no diversity in professional services departments, at any level (from analyst to senior Director), and no affinity groups to act as a support system. SWA just really isn't great at developing talent in general, especially talent under 30, SWA leaders (at the manger director level) are more focussed on their own careers than developing a pipeline of leaders.  This could be a larger People Department issue, not necessarily just departmental issues at SWA. There is a Diversity and Inclusion department that's more focussed on making sure everyone gets along and tolerates each other (everybody sing kumbaya! this is somewhat important, i'll admit), when they should, in my opinion be more focused on recruiting, retaining and developing top minority (I'm including women in this conversation) talent (this is much more important, i think). Should probably start looking into, \"I wonder why latina woman X started the same day as man Y and has had stellar reviews but can't seem to push past the XXX level when man Y has with east\" That's when they're really doing the work that moves diversity forward. Women are definitely much more impacted by the lack of diversity at the top than underrepresented minorities (So few URMs at SWA you can't really even measure how much they're missing out on opportunities, kinda unfortunate)There is a reason why there are no underrepresented minorities in leadership (outside of the operation) at SWA and it could be related to a lack of opportunity available, potentially generated by leadership's bias in views of performance, or just a general non-preference if I had to guess. The talent is/was there, and they/we are flourishing at companies with similar caliber brands (American Airlines, Microsoft, Google, top tier consulting firms etc. -- most of which have affinity groups) .

Most certainly not a way of life for the long term for most.  \r\nSeverely antiquated technology and processes.  Company does not adequately budget for technology development and is playing catch-up with improvements that are slow to materialize.\r\nSeverely underpaid on virtually all levels of non-unionized workforce.  Company relies on brand name and company culture to excite applicants, but uses antiquated pay scale system for compensation.  Money is without a doubt a taboo topic and pay raises are bare minimum (2-3% for most non-union employees.)\r\nUltra limited advancement opportunities.  Simply put, there are no jobs to move up to!

Most definitely an expert in trying to 'reinvent the wheel,' often to its own detriment that adds to inefficiencies and wasteful spending.  For instance, when company took delivery of 737-800 aircraft, it redesigned galleys that make zero sense, added mini carts that are of course not used now due to impracticality for single-aisle aircraft, and in 2016 will be redesigned because they did not work from the get-go.  Operationally-speaking, company has been attempting to transition from point-to-point to a hybrid of hub-and-spoke and point-to-point.  Sometimes, it feels like company tries to fit a round peg into a square hole.

I have moved back seniority wise the last 5 years, which reflects in the shift you can hold, therefore the quality of life you have with your family. Unions have and always will keep the people you want to see get fired...from being fired.

Having worked for other corporations the medical insurance with Southwest is very reasonably priced. \r\nI would say flight benefits....but it seems that every time you want to fly the flights fill up, If you like living out of a carry-on, can be flexible enough to change your travel plans and never really PLAN anything then the free flights are right up your alley. If you're like most folks who would at least like to reserve a hotel room in the city to which you are trying to fly.......prepare yourself to fly in the \"off season\". In that case be prepared for typhoons, hurricanes, and snow storms. \r\nI do however like the ability to fly non-revenue on other airlines, and at reduced rates internationally. There is something to be said for flying round trip from the USA to China for under $300. \r\nThe pay - while the highest of the industry (so reported???) is still very dependant upon job and classification. I think they would do better to pay their lower and middle management a more competitive wage. The entry level pay seems low, but after a short time it increases rapidly.\r\nIf dressing up for holidays (and halloween) is your thing, you will love this company. They do like to get into the season...whatever the season may be. \r\nMost of the people you work with will become lifelong friends, there is an environment that fosters care for each other. You will need to work together to meet or exceed goals.", "cons": "I have seen way to many people get promoted to positions that FAR exceed thier skills and/or abilities. This is one of my biggest problems with Southwest & AirTran. Its all in who you know. It seems hard work and dedication is often overlooked, to get promoted you need to be a drinking buddy or college frat brother. Southwest is an analog airline in a digital age. I worked for Airtran until we were purchased by Southwest. Airtran was a much more \"advanced\" company from an IT/computer standpoint. Southwest is still handing out pencils and sharpners to its supervisors. Its a very \"mother-may-I\" system. Exceptional work ethic will only get you more hours to \"prove\" yourself worthy, while you watch slackers get away with fraud and get promoted before you because of my previous statement. If you every want to move up past the supervisor level, you will need to move to Dallas. Thats the part they dont tell you. If moving from where you currently live is not an option for you, plan on being a career supervisor.\r\nThe touchy - feely positive employee atmosphere they talk about hides a very dark secret. Its only that way as long as you follow the plan (even if its wrong), as soon as you begin to think outside the box, or suggest ideas that actually make sense and work well in the industry and other large corporations you get treated very poorly, and all that warm and fuzzy goes away. You MUST drink the cool-aid to stay in good graces with upper management or face becoming an outsider. \r\nThe unions - of which there are 11, while they may have thier place, be prepared to see people who make $20+ an hour and will not lift a finger to help thier co-workers, always get away with something and should have been fired years ago, every company has a few employees like this, but it seems Southwest breeds them! They are like a cancer on the organization. As such so much time is spent AND WASTED on issues that should be a non-issue for a company that has been in business for 40 years and now sits atop of the industry. \r\nOvertime....while we all like to work a little and make some extra cash, at some point it gets ludicris to force your staff to work mandatory overtime because of staffing and call-out issues. Everyone knows there is a problem but upper management will not force change to correct it. Its actually hard to get fired...unless you just dont come to work. Then if that happens, just call your shop steward and we'll see you back at work in a week. \r\nInstead of empowering the workforce to cross-train, and cross utilize, or even assist with mundane tasks they will hire someone to do one thing and only one thing. Example = if your job is to push this red button, dont touch the green one. Even if your ar qualified and have 20 years of experience pushing the green one, dont touch it. We will hire someone else to do it. From a supervisor standpoint, they create far to much \"busy work\". Instead of being able to actually supervise you will spend most of your day completeing mundane and meaningless \"audits\" with a pencil, remember its an analog airline in a digital age. They do not allow you to think, or trust you to think for yourself. You have to fill out an audit just to make sure there is nothing askew with certian area of the operation. Because you are not adept enough to correct the issues, you have to report it and have someone fly in from Dallas to tell you how to do it \"the Southwest way\"."}, {"review_title": "Loved working for this company!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Mar 2014", "job_title": "Flight Attendant in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits were amazing.

Finally, a company I could work for that had a reputation for treating it's employees great. When I went in for my interview I let them know my greatest asset was my positive attitude and that I would work very hard for them if hired. Everything leading up to training in Dallas was perfect. They flew us to a People department and overwhelmed us with love, letting us know how fortunate we were to work for such a great company while explaining our benefits. Amidst the glow, individual contracts were set out in front of us, with the base pay and the union who had negotiated it. I couldn't have felt more proud of myself for landing this job. I then returned to the station where I trained for about a month with someone, after which I went to the training headquarters in Dallas for three weeks of paid training. All the moments I spent there were wonderful. There was free coffee everywhere, and they put us up in a nice hotel and gave us food cards. It was heaven, and again I felt lucky and so proud to work for Southwest Airlines. I cannot express how great the Corporate culture is. The benefits you receive, as well as the welcome you get, are the main and only highlights of this job. However, once you return from Dallas, the reality sets in: something is not as it seems. This really is too good to be true.", "cons": "A week after I returned from Dallas, I had completed my training and finally began a probationary period of 6 months. During this time you begin your union contract and bid for a shift. Per the contract: Southwest employees cannot decline mandatory overtime, call in sick, or come to work late. If you do, you receive an occurrence. Three occurrences and you are terminated. During this time it became perfectly clear that I was an employee number. Nothing more. 60 hour weeks were commonplace.\r\nImagine: Your shift is Wednesday through Sunday 3pm - 11:30pm. On Wednesday you work your regular shift, but clock out late due to delays: 3pm - 1:30am (10 hours). However, you are assigned mandatory overtime (remember you cannot decline this without being fired) for 2 hours after you get off at 3:45am - 11:45am. You then work from 3pm - 11:30pm the same day. Imagine that this happens 2 times a week, every week. That is the reality of Southwest Airlines. Throughout my probationary period this was VERY common, and again happened at least 2 times a week. The most I had to work was 81 hours in one week, four 16 hour shifts back to back, and then a regular 8 hour shift on one of my days off. It's not the type of work that is the problem, it is the amount of work.\r\nUpon asking union leaders and management, their responses were, and I quote VERBATIM: If you don't like it, maybe this job isn't for you. Once completing your probationary period, which is rare as people literally fall asleep on the job and are fired, or break down from the mental stress of staying awake for 2 days straight, you can decline the overtime. Even then, 16 hour days are a common occurrence, as is mandatory overtime. The IAM union contract states that for every refusal of mandatory overtime, you accrue half a point (.5). If you accrue 9 points, you are subject to termination. In the single month after my probation I accrued 5 points by simply declining overtime. Per the contract, it takes 3 months for just 2 points to drop from your record, during which time you cannot be late, call in sick without a doctors note, or decline ANY overtime. As it stands, my weeks are never less than 50 hours. NEVER.\r\nThis amount of work results in huge employee burnout. I recently spoke with someone at Headquarters in Dallas who said, \"Right now we have a high turnover rate for customer service and we are trying to figure out why.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot in good conscious recommend this job to anyone that values their sanity."}], [{"review_title": "Top company to work for in the US.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Sept 2008", "job_title": "Flight Attendant in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company.
