Brand new design system that was never built with or consulted by potential design system users; incredibly difficult to install, implement, and utilize. Little to no ability to update, change, or enhance design system and no staff to the project to assist with impending deadlines. My team specifically has been without a direct manager for over 4 months, and the interim manager they put in place has terrible leadership qualities.

Some of the turn over is due to some burned out Leads who make the work environment very toxic. As a newbie it's hard to know who to go to when certain things happen, but know that even if you turn in the people who are making things toxic, nothing will get done/fixed. They record every single call and that means they can and do go back and listen to what happened between you and that other co-worker, but again, even when they tell you that they listened and they are \"sorry\" this happened blah blah blah, it doesn't change anything. Fact, you are just another warm body to answer calls and they know you won't stay because most don't and shouldn't!

Their Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives are on the right track, professed company value of safety before all else, high value on service (to customer) and some relative flexibility in how to handle many situations as an agent", "cons": "Low pay, grueling hours, split shifts (especially if working part-time) impossible to live off of, high premium and high deductible health insurance (especially for part-time), everything is seniority-based, including scheduling and vacation bidding. The professed culture of safety is not always adhered to, and neither is the culture of service in favor of on time performance and efficiency: working more flights, faster, at a lower standard of safety and service. High focus on profit for the company (so paying workers low wages) at the expense of retention. This means lots of turnover and the company seems to be fine constantly investing in hiring more people and training them to replace employees leaving than in paying existing employees enough and making their work conditions better so that they stay. Company culture in application often lacks the actual inclusivity and open-mindedness that they profess to value, coming off of as the too-proper business uncle who crashed the party that Virgin America was having for their employees and passengers. Training is not very thorough and support from supervisors is thin, and often non-existent. Though there is an emphasis on reporting for safety and customer service events, often the company will side with the customer and put the blame on the employee if something negative happens, even though the employee is usually subject to conflicting expectations, policies, and procedures. If you are broke (or exhausted) from working this job, you won't be able to use the flight benefits you have to make the job worth it, because you aren't paid a living wage that would allow you to leave your house on off-days, let alone travel domestically or internationally. It's also difficult to get days off sometimes, depending on your workgroup, location, and seniority. If no one wants to take your shift, you can't drop it and you are stuck working that shift, even if it isn't what you want. As an agent, you can only trade away 50% or fewer of your shifts for the month. It is additionally hard to get unpaid leave, except during the height of covid. You have to report any other job you have to the company. Therefore, with inflexible hours and having to report outside employment, they make it exceedingly hard to try to get ahead by working another job in your off time so that you don't rely on this low pay to survive. DEI is mostly talk and all the people at the top of the corporation are still white men except one is a white woman. There is still explicit and implicit microaggressions in the uniform code against POC and LGBTQIA+ people, and the uniform code itself is, once again: very conservative and limiting, dictating the number of piercings you can have in each ear (it's 2) and where in the ear they can be, what type of and how much jewelry you can wear, lots of details for the shoes, and bizarrely specific rules about which uniform piece can be worn with which other uniform pieces and which uniform pieces are not allowed to be worn alone- including in which locations and at what time. Supervisors or even coworkers will report these uniform violations and you can get written up and even fired for them. Additionally, there is an absolutely draconian attendance policy which considers sick calls \"points\" against you that can get you fired when you are still on Probation. You can get points for being late as well- often the same for 1 minute as for 30 min. This policy disincentives people from calling in sick until they have worked there for long enough to pass probation, and so they are coming into work sick or else getting fired. Even once past probation, the attendance policy is so specific and intense that it doesn't account for people being human."}, {"review_title": "good place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "20 Dec 2022", "job_title": "CSA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "free tickets health insurance paid training", "cons": "pay is not that good"}, {"review_title": "Pros &Cons", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "10 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Finance", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great travel perks for employees and family", "cons": "The pay could be better Provide Work from home option"}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "14 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Systems Engineer in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flight Benefits are great to have", "cons": "Health benefits out of pocket is a bit high"}, {"review_title": "Nice company to work for", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Airline Customer Service Agent", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They work with you to learn the job.", "cons": "Be sure to study hard for your evaluation"}, {"review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Guest Service Team Member", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Enjoyed the team culture and flexibility in schedule", "cons": "I do not think that there were any"}, {"review_title": "Good experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A great adventure, met great people and saw many wonderful places", "cons": "Difficult to commute to base"}, {"review_title": "Good for stay at home moms or people who don\u2019t value work/life balance", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Reservations Agent", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Somewhat decent travel benefits.

I believed that the stellar performance I'd had in the role in a single year would be rewarded. I drove significant revenues for the company.

I have had a lot of jobs in my relatively short 23 years of life and never have I experienced such agony and dread going into work than I did working in the reservations department of Alaska Airlines. The job is incredibly complex computer-wise with multiple programs that you learn over an excruciatingly long period of 3 weeks. These classes are taught at a snail's pace and anybody that excels at the work is either made fun of or told to slow down by classmates and the trainers.\r\n\r\nAs for when the work begins, the frustrations literally never end. The Seattle call center was absolutely disgusting when my class of about 30 people arrived which meant overflowing trash cans, a 40 year old \"break room\" with broken vending machines and moldy floors and toilets that were constantly out of toilet paper and smelled endlessly of urine. Beyond the actual dreariness of the call center and their lack of nice desks, chairs or computers, the work is miserable.\r\n\r\nYou literally sit at a desk for minimum 8 hours and talk to mostly angry, rude and disrespectful customers all day long. Meanwhile, every single move you make on the computer is being closely watched by corporate supervisors and any call can be monitored and strictly critiqued by your \"team leaders\". If you have to use the bathroom or take a personal phone call for more than 8 minutes within your shift, you'll get in trouble and may not pass probation. If you tell them you cannot work an additional 3 hours of \"mandatory\" overtime at the end of your shift because your baby is sick, you may not pass probation. If you have to leave work because you're throwing up with morning sickness, you may not pass probation. Corporate (aka the non union supervisors that are paid a heck of a lot more than the measly $11.56 you make) constantly hold over your head the fact that if you \"misbehave\" AT ALL, you may not pass probation.\r\n\r\nI also had a schedule called \"relief\" which means that I would never know my schedule until 5 days before it started and it only lasted for 5 days and then it would switch to something else. Not only my schedule but also my days off changed every 5 days. I finally quit after I received my 3 am - 11 am shift and was asked for probably the 10th time since I had started working on the actual phones 2 months before to work another 3 hours after my shift was over at 11am. I told them no. That the company did not take care of me, that if they didn't respect my time in the slightest, that I didn't respect them at all.\r\n\r\nTo wrap up, I just want to explain to someone that while the entire Alaska company is not necessarily awful, the reservations call center feels like it should honestly be happening in a country you typically expect call centers to be in, because that's the conditions and pay that we received. I now work for Nordstrom and have never been more happier however so I guess all things happen for a reason."}], [{"review_title": "Terrible Company", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Oct 2017", "job_title": "Customer Service Agent", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "We got to keep our jobs after the merger.", "cons": "Where do i begin with this one.\r\nThey took an amazing airline known as Virgin America out of an airport and replaced it with Alaska.

I should have researched the nature of this work more thoroughly before I started training. There were a few red flags along the way that I figured I would share for anybody researching this company and job before they sign the paperwork. They boast that they are growing very rapidly as a company and they on a hiring spree, but my training class has 30+ people, and they had a new class start one week after mine did. Prior to my start date, they had a class just finishing up with the same number of new hires. 90 new employees within the span of a month... Growth or high turnover? My bet is on the latter now that I know what this job entails. My guess is that people make it 6-12 months into this job before they jump ship due to the hours, management, and strict nature of the work. The work from home option is temping for people for various reasons, but trust me, working from home will be precisely the same as coming to the call center (aside from the commute). They monitor you at your home via drop in listening and webcam (skype). They time your breaks and lunch at home the same way they time you in the call center. It's difficult to feel like you're being watched the entire time you're at work and it's exhausting. I feel mentally drained most days I come home from work. Oddly enough, sitting in front of a computer fatigues me after eight hours. \r\n\r\nMy advice to you, job seeker, is to find another way to make money.
