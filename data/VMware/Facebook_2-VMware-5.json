There is no concept of customizing something special for the customer. Features gets added to the base product itself.\r\n\t-- Everyone codes, fresher to top level manager. Ultra flat organizational structure.\r\n\t-- New products and features are always in request. You really get to create stuff.\r\n\t-- Many a time, you get to work with programming veterans.

There is collective thought.\r\n\r\nMy share of rant:\r\n\t-- If you are not passionate about programming, air-watch R/D is not the right place to be. One need to be ready to read, try out code to strengthen one's understanding. If your priority is not software development in work hours, look for a a services organization elsewhere.\r\n\t-- Bad code puts a team in jeopardy - poor souls need to maintain the crappy software resulting from point above.\r\n\t-- you need not be a rocket scientist at all - All that is needed is solid basics in computing and a strong desire to learn more.", "cons": "-- Yes, Yes, more salary will make me more happy!"}, {"review_title": "Join only if you are in college", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You are just out of college, you get to learn new technologies.

The end goal and indicator of the success of our products will ultimately manifest itself in the elimination of the people who have implemented it.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately what was a great place to work has become an entity which has lost its way.  There are sufficient pockets of mercenary cronyism that exist that taint the entire corporate culture.

In the Diane Greene days, management lines were clear and direct but since her departure there have been stacks and stacks of middle managers. The company has grown to be diamond-shaped: A few C-level guys on top, lots and lots and lots senior directors, directors, group managers, senior managers, and managers in the middle, and almost nobody at the bottom to execute. The people at the bottom are completely overworked and underpaid, while important decisions can't be made because of CYA middle managers who don't want to take any responsibility. \r\n\r\nThere has been a \"hiring freeze\" for the past 3 quarters, yet they have been stacking VPs and senior directors left and right. People who have left are not replaced, so guess what that does? Yup, more work for everyone else. And what happens to those people? They eventually leave too.\r\n\r\nEgos and incompetency run wild with most middle and upper management. The fact is engineering and product development are the most important teams because they generate the products that make VMware great. Very few middle managers realize this and continue to push for useless programs with poorly developed infrastructure that ends up costing tons of money in the long run because of poor implementation and complete lack of vision. \r\n\r\nLines of communication are as clear as mud. Despite the glass offices and conference rooms (that Diane wanted as a symbol of transparency), it is very difficult to get information from one team to another because of lack of processes and workflow. \r\n\r\nFinally, I am surprised at the lack of IT budget (for instance, the View virtual desktops are painfully slow because they don't have the adequate server infrastructure) and cheapness of the hardware - we're all running POS Dell laptops that suffer hardware failures after 6 months. Can't we afford IBM? Also, I couldn't believe that there is no protection on these laptops. A laptop was stolen from me with some sensitive data on it, and the IT guy said to me \"don't worry, nobody can break into your computer since they don't know your password.\" Uh, I'm sure most 13 year old whiz kids can hack a Win XP password with no problems."}], [{"review_title": "Love Working at VMware", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jun 2010", "job_title": "Senior Recruiter", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Innovation, energy and excitement about building revolutionary products.

He also couldn't be bothered with running a company and hired others to do it.  In 2012 VMware spent $1.25B on Nicira, in effect buying back some of the people that left in or before 2011.

This 2011 bleed likely contributed to vSphere 5.1 being the \"Windows Vista\" of virtualization releases, and it's likely to contribute to the next release being the equivalent of \"Windows 8\".  The \"Principle Engineers\" that remain are less ambitious and don't seem to do much (and certainly don't set a good example or tone for the rest of R&D).  The company has taken various surveys to find out how unhappy people are but never took any steps to determine the underlying reasons why or address them.

Being underpaid was fine (as I was out to soak in skills) , but when your work isn't valued around by the business, you lose motivation quickly. \r\n\r\nThere are lots of faults in every layer of management, but if executive management doesn't shift their current culture, the information security department will cease to exist.

The company is making short/medium-term decisions in order increase the revenue, without realizing that the competition is getting better and better. The partnership with AWS won\u2019t save VMware in the long term, IMHO (but I hope I'm wrong). The company needs to implement a *much* better (faster, robust, scalable) management infrastructure. If I had to develop a service based on virtualization today, probably I won\u2019t choose the VMware stack. Sadly, the core virtualization code is still probably the best in the world, but that's not enough anymore today. Now, the problem lies in layers above it and the competition is already offering solutions which scale much better.\r\n\r\nAnother problem caused by this whole situation is that good engineers are leaving every day, choosing other companies because they're offering them more interesting jobs. As a result of that, the company pays more and more the current employees in order to keep them and often makes way too much compromises when hiring new people. This causes a downward spiral: bad hires hire even worse hires, at all levels.

There is clear separation between what teams do and there is rarely any overlap between their responsibilities. The company is very innovation driven. While VMware is very focused on providing virtualization software and cloud solutions, it is not afraid to explore other opportunities where a business solution can expand into a leading product.\r\n\r\nWhat matters to me is that VMware takes its employees seriously. The voice of every employee matters. Opinions are evaluated and acted upon. In my team, I have voiced my concerns several times and every member of my team has collaborated together to address the issues I brought up. This gives rooms for contributions not only inside the team, but also in work itself. Good work is rewarded and mangers show their gratitude and support for employees who have helped make important progress. This makes it possible to steadily grow professionally.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the company is concerned in making sure employees work in a productive environment. It attempts to mitigate the stress most employees feel by organizing social events, activities, retreats, etc.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I enjoy at the company is the atmosphere. Colleagues are kind, friendly and helpful. This facilitates easy communication and allows work to be accomplished quickly and effectively.", "cons": "The only negative aspect is that VMware tends to hire people who have only recently started their education. This leads to a big skill gap between them and other junior employees. That causes slow work progress in certain cases in the first several months of their employment.

Thankfully, VMware is a great company so you get the trifecta!  Everyone gets to do their own calculus when evaluating potential employers, but I suggest focusing first on the work you'll be doing, second on the person who will be your manager and third on the values of the company that pays you.\r\n\r\nMy team is majority male but our female employees are some of our best, many of them getting well-deserved promotions (and, I think, resulting in our most senior team members being mostly women).  My team celebrates EVERYONE's birthday, everyone's work anniversaries, everyone's promotions.  Our team's email group receives sometimes 25 questions a day from our own team members, yet I've never seen one of them go unanswered.  That's the culture of my team (fostered by my manager) and it's a direct result of the culture of the company.\r\n\r\nAnyone who's concerned about the future of the company (in the face of competition from the public cloud) should take time to familiarize themselves with VMware's strategy.

There is a constant tug of war for resources and project prioritazation between and among PMs and managers and the different R&D groups. Communications between groups are very poor, as a result there are grudges held between managers, a lot of back and forth dealings so that the focus shifts from what's best/right for the company to individual agendas. It's very sad to watch this when VMware has such a great potential of engineering talents to carry out the projects.\r\n\r\nCareer advancement process is also confusing and not communicated well to engineers. There isn't a consistency on the set of objectives each engineer should meet in order to advance to the next level. Often times it seems to rely more on how far the individual's manager is willing to push for it, rather than the merit. No one knows what it really takes to be promoted. It got to be very demoralizing.\r\n\r\nThere are some good managers in the company, but they seem to be the exception rather than the rule.
