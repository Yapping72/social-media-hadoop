They have a few extra days off for COVID, but so do many other IT organisations\r\nOnboarding was a relatively seamless experience. However, don\u2019t expect any support from management.

The Talent Acquisition team does not even call back unsuccessful internal hires and completely ignores referrals. They are a group of stuck up airheads who are more interested in kissing up to sales managers who are equally superficial.\r\nMany senior people are high on their flatulence, trying to act like the most intelligent person in the room. Not because they are competent or experienced, but more so because everyone is constantly on guard looking over their shoulders, trying not to get stabbed in the back.\r\nCompany EPIC2 principles are a total sham and are there for bragging rights only. In other global offices, leaders are noticeably more sincere and do have a high level of integrity. But the Australian managers are probably the worst of any company I have ever worked for. They act like narcissists who will only do charitable work if they can showboat it to invite accolades internally and on LinkedIn.\r\nThe result is a high turnover of staff, especially in the Melbourne office. Talented people are constantly leaving for better-run organisations like Microsoft, Salesforces, Splunk, Google and AWS. \r\nAlmost NO diversity in Australia.
