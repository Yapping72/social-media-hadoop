VMware and Dell have struggled mightily to get employees, partners, customers, and investors to believe this. This round of layoffs was not a typical January house cleaning; those that were let go were tenured and respected team members, which is very alarming.

Pretty incredible.", "cons": "Unfortunately despite all of the Pros I listed, the cons outweigh them for me, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nI'll be leaving within the month.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell there is a HUGE management problem at VMware. I've only started in the past 6 months so I came in with what I like to think is a fresh perspective. If you can, scroll through the past Glassdoor reviews and look for one titled \u201cLooking back, VMware has some major problems\u201d from November, 2014. It turned out to be very, very prescient for me. I remember reading it before I started and thinking, \"well, that's interesting.\" It hits the nail so squarely on the head it's a bit eery. \r\n\r\nTo summarize and add my own color to that review: There is a huge disconnect between the various levels of management at VMware and what you get from one high-level VP, may not match what the Director says, which may not match what your manager says. \r\n\r\nVery regularly I will have a Sr Director or VP bypass my own leader (a Director) and give me completely different priorities and instructions. You end up in a situation where you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. And, just like in the movie Office Space, you find yourself telling the same thing to 3 different managers who are asking you to fill out your TPS reports correctly. I'm an engineering manager, my job is mostly spent sorting out politics and not leading a team of capable engineers.\r\n\r\nUltimately the problem really affects the individual contributors, the folks that really make it happen, who are left to sort out the mess. Not surprisingly, folks get and frustrated and leave. The turn-over rate, at least in my group, is depressing. \r\n\r\nIt's impossible to retain the top talent that VMware desperately needs to stay relevant as the technology they've built the whole business on is quickly changing (containers, Amazon, etc). There are two main camps (maybe three) of folks who seem to stick it out:\r\n\r\n(A) Those who are afraid to go outside of VMware because this is all they've become jaded and complacent. This has become all they know. The tell tale sign is you see them shopping online all day, reading facebook, etc.\r\n\r\n(B) Those on visas or something similar from India/China/etc who don't have an easy path to moving to somewhere else or are only aware of this sort of big company culture. \r\n\r\n(C) The third camp of folks is the highest level executives, who are quite polished as you'd expect, they stick it out because they're not really exposed to what's going on at the lower levels and are likely oblivious, or don't really care. This is just a notch in their belt before they move on to their next executive position.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day you're left with people who feel stuck (and are driven like rented mules to make up for the lack of quality engineers, eg working harder versus smarter) as they watch brief gusts of fresh air come by (new, smart, intelligent engineers) that quickly evacuate as soon as they get a hold of how things operate. \r\n\r\nIt's a shame really. :-( I was so excited to be at VMware but it's time to go after only 6 months."}, {"review_title": "Inside Partner Business Manager", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for.

I was there 5 years and felt valued and supported.  I never had a bad annual review and by most measures was going above and beyond.  Our team was periodically recognized as doing excellent work and our skills were absolutely unique in the company.  I would have given a Glassdoor review similar to others you see indicating \"no negatives I can think of at this time\" \u2026but then I fell victim to January layoffs.  I waited a full year from being laid off to do this review so I would do it for the right reasons.  \r\nThere was no reason given other than \"restructuring\" as others have indicated in their reviews.  My guess is that VMware thinks of its employees as all living in the Bay Area where jobs are plentiful.  It took me 7 months to find another good job and it was very hurtful to my financial situation.  Any goodwill I had for VMware was obviously damaged and I would warn others who are considering VMware that you are at risk of being layed-off as a matter of course rather than based on your performance.  \r\nI feel I also should point out that VMware uses stock as a part of its compensation to retain talent and after going through a layoff,  there is little doubt in my. mind that one of the major goals of the January layoffs is to recuperate your stock (for many of us six-figure + amounts of stock).  It is no coincidence that layoffs happen at a time that immediately precedes the vesting date of stock.  As an example, I would have started vesting less than 30 days after my stated last day of work and every person I talked to affected by the January \u201crestructuring\u201d were in the same boat.  \r\nAnother important thing to understand is when you are let go by VMware, you are told that the company will give you resources to hopefully get rehired - which they do.  However, I can tell you I wasted a lot of time applying for jobs internally at VMware and based on the behavior of the hiring managers, I am convinced the burden of my stock was a consideration and put me to the bottom of the queue rather than feeling like my extensive knowledge of VMware and my solid track record wold be a plus.  People I was friendly with wouldn't even give me the time of day and I was nothing but discouraged by people when I would reach out.  I certainly bear fault for not looking outside the company more those first couple of months but I would not recommend spending significant time on those efforts if you find yourself in a similar situation.\r\n\r\nI would be particularly careful about joining VMware's bloated corporate marketing team."}, {"review_title": "Great technology.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Aug 2008", "job_title": " Member of Technical Staff  in Palo Alto, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great technology and interesting things to work on.", "cons": "Lots of people don't know what they're doing.

Additionally, the change has moved the company out of start-up mode, so instead of product-product-product, there is a shift going on towards quality that benefits employee well being.", "cons": "The Management: The company leadership at the AirWatch level is still driven by a sales-first principle that keeps R&D from ever getting to work towards product quality. Pushing to change from the start-up 'land grab' thought process where market share is everything to a more established company's concern for providing quality to its customers will make employees, investors, and customers happy. We've got the market share, now lets make the product work right.\r\n\r\nSupport Organization Training: R&D is directly involved in day-to-day support, because the PSO/Support organization does not receive adequate training in the product prior to being thrown to the wolves. QA and Development resources are dedicated to what is essentially tier 4 support for entire product release cycles (which damages the quality of new code going out the door due to resource squeeze) on a per team basis, and there is a real sense that the R&D team is the end-all, be-all of where the buck stops for any issue. Given the nature of this belief in the company, support team members are not incentive to do any critical thinking or problem solving, as the solution to most customer issues is to push a ticket to the R&D team for support, after which they can offload responsibility for the issue. Better training for the support team would prevent the issue with R&D resource allocation (making the product better, making support less time consuming, etc.), and help provide better support to the customer.\r\n\r\nHiring Policies: Internally, there appears to be a feeling that quality can be driven by adding additional BA/PM team members to a scrum/product group, while having a sometimes 3:1 or 4:1 developer to QA ratio. QA is asked to certify releases with little to no real time to test the product fully, which results in quality loss (and employee frustration). Instead of trying to drive quality through development/PM, try to build teams with a more reasonable ratio (2:1 Dev to QA?), so that real quality can be a focus instead of a pipe-dream."}, {"review_title": "VMWare", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Member of Technical Staff III in Colorado Springs, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Vmware was one of those dream jobs and for the most part lived up to that dream.

It is 100% sales. How often will you need to give a sales pitch as a member of the R&D team? It would make a lot more sense if they tailored the training to one day of overall AW history, then Console basics, than finally your department. \r\n\r\nAt Airwatch if you accept an offer for QA you do not decide where you will be placed. \r\n\r\nFor example, If you have worked for Apple for 3 years and have a lot of experience debugging iOS applications, you will be placed on a windows mobile team. You are placed where you are needed not based on your strengths. Be prepared to move a lot too, after working on your first team, you will be relocated to another when half of their team decides they have had enough. \r\n\r\nYou will be lucky however if you get one of the two actual competent managers for QA. \r\nThose two are active within their team and actually work, while the others sit around \"handing out tasks\" and try to come up with processes that will just make your life harder. \r\n\r\nIn all honestly the R&D team is a tornado of 10 people actually working while the rest complain about how young their team is and that they are bored.  If you happen to be one of the people that work then you will not get any rewards or compensation aside from maybe a thank you from your customers support ticket . Their QA is about as flat as it gets. If you want to move up someone needs to leave and I can bet the person looking for the promotion will be the one to leave. \r\n\r\nThat brings me to their attrition rate. ~50% of the people at AW have been with the company for less than a year. This is not because \"Our employees are learning so much that they move on.\" It is because the management and amount of work are ridiculous for the \"compensation\" you will be getting. Turnover is high for a reason, and it is not a positive one. \r\n\r\nWorkload is insane and unrealistic as many people on here have said. There is always some customer issue and YOU WILL be pulled away from your current task to work on it. That being said, you will be split across 1000 things to do and nobody will take that into account. You will have PMs jumping down your throat while your \"Lead\" will be giving you some made up task to validate their position. No one understands that you are being pulled in six different directions which causes you to have to stay late almost everyday.  It is not uncommon to have a 10+ hour day or to work on weekends while in QA. This would be fine if management put in the same amount of work.\r\n\r\nYou will be splitting work with the India team, but don't expect your lead to treat them like equals. For the Atlanta team, India is there to take blame when something isn't completed. They are not valued like they should be, much like most of the company.  \r\n\r\nHuge lack of professionalism, you CAN NOT come gossip about how someone just had an awful interview and was \"a complete waste of my time, and a total idiot.\" \r\n\r\nManagement is the absolute worst part about this company. All they want to do is put their hands in as many cookie-jars as they can just so they can say \"I had a part in this.\"  Office politics are at an all time high.  Most will not listen to their team for new processes or more efficient ways to do things. \r\n\r\nYou will learn a lot don't get me wrong but here is the most likely scenario. \r\n\r\nYou will probably work here for about a year, realize just how awful it is and then leave."}, {"review_title": "VMware - From the Field!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Strategic Account Manager in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People at VMware are just plain NICE!
