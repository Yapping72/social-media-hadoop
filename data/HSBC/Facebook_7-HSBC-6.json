Leaving my prior job for HSBC was a massive career mistake. 90% of the leadership (GB3+) isn't technical, lacks creativity and has no vision. \r\n\r\n-From getting the official offer, onboarding to day-to-day it was the most disorganized, to the point of being unprofessional, company I've ever worked for or with. \r\n\r\n-After a year I found myself making less money after a massive cut to my bonus - with no explanation, with less control, with fewer resources, and in a less progressive business culture than prior roles. \r\n\r\n-My manager cared more about political land grabs and PR than building legitimate machine learning programs. Their focus is on not making waves, looking like they are building something despite being clueless, and or avoiding owning any decision at all cost. Standing out, even for good things, was a bad thing.\r\n\r\n-There is nothing you can get at HSBC that you couldn't another F100 while making more money and being in a more professional environment.\r\n\r\n-Everything was undisciplined, reactionary, and disorganized. Basic things like paying vendors , or decisions in general,  are typically 6-12 months overdue months late because of incompetence.\r\n\r\n-Do not trust what they say about resources in the interview - there is no real  process. Budgets  are 100% dictated by \"ExCos,\" who hear and repeat buzz terms like \"agile,\" \"transformation\", \"cloud\" or \"AI\" understand none of it and allocate at random. \r\n\r\n- For the ambitious or innovative there are no professional development or mentoring opportunities. There is no reason to stay past 18-24 months. 100% of people with modern skills were miserable and looking to leave within six months shocked by how low the bar is. \r\n\r\n-Most executives are either ex MBB consultants or IM's that have been there or are going to be there 10-20 years. No one in between. I thought most of the IMs were solid - much more so than the consultants who were given leadership roles. It felt like they cared. But if you aren't one of the two, I can't recall upward mobility past GB3.  \r\n\r\n-Never saw a person promoted for skill or originality, but executing, often I'll thought out, plans and not questioning the powers at be. Mind HSBC's stock and profits didn't drop 55% and 35% percent over the last two years because of good decision-making.
