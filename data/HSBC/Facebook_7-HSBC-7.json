First, mismanagement. Across different cohorts graduates have been told at the very last minute of \u201csudden business changes\u201d which required re-assignments from value-adding placements to basic call centre roles, and in at least two instances even a mandatory extension of at least six months to the 18-months programme graduates signed on to. What graduates signed on to was an 18-month national mobility situation, not what inevitability transpired as described. It was widely felt that there was complete disregard for any personal circumstances, where everyone was expected to accept this out-of-contract, unforeseen arrangement without protest (for any protest received admonishments for graduates being \u201cungrateful\u201d and \u201centitled\u201d and \u201chaving bad attitudes\u201d), uproot themselves and resolve any logistical or financial issues at last-minute notice, with minimum to no support. \r\n\r\nSecond, under-qualified graduate managers. While the above described could be explained as top-down instructions outside of the graduate team\u2019s control being poorly executed by the graduate managers, the managers\u2019 lack of CMB knowledge and lack of initiative to remedy that after years of being in the role was inexcusable. This was particularly problematic was because graduate placements were allocated by graduate managers, who screened placement applications. Graduates were told to write their applications in laymen terms, because if graduates included \u201ctechnical banking terms\u201d, the graduate managers would not be able to understand the application and would disregard those parts as irrelevant. This greatly affected the chances of graduates being placed in teams that best fit their skills and desired career paths. \r\n\r\nNumerous other issues could be raised with ample examples which would result in this review being unreadably long. I hope, however, that the detailed examples given in this review could give some context as to how the CMB graduate scheme was run. \r\n\r\nI could confirm here, however, that as stated in the 29 June 2020 review, favouritism and preferential treatments were existent, and that the high dropout rate of graduates particularly in the past year, as well as graduates taking time off due to the graduate programme compromising graduates\u2019 mental health were true."}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Product Controller in Krak\u00f3w", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good money, work life balance", "cons": "All time doing the same things"}, {"review_title": "manager", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Manager in Hong Kong", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good package to work here", "cons": "not much to work here"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Experience at working in big teams", "cons": "Depends mostly on which team you are in.

The training group I joined were all herded on the telephones as quickly as possibly with abject and minimal training (3 days out of the 20 days training was spent covering a topic which is not relevant to the role). \r\n\r\nThe training provided was by a third-party company and not HSBC, therefore, information that was being provided in training was out-of-date and not in line with current policy and procedure.\r\n\r\nMyself and others had first-hand experiences of harassment and bullying from selective colleagues and managers. One particular incident I remember is a \u2018senior\u2019 manager trying to make an example of me in front of the office floor of 15/20 people. I cannot give the specific example because it will probably identify who I am , and I\u2019m confident the managers will have a good-laugh about how they tried to belittle me . This example is just one of many within the Swansea \u2018call-centre\u2019 of management being pedantic about trivial issues instead of managing staff properly and providing a high level of customer service. \r\n\r\nAfter this particular incident I lost all respect for management within the \u2018call-centre\u2019 and immediately started looking for alternative employment. \r\n\r\nConflicting information from employee to employee! Because the organisation is so large, it\u2019s hard to have consistent messages communicated. I found that i\u2019d come in one morning and one senior is telling you one thing and another manager another, which in a customer service role can lead to very irate and annoyed customers if you\u2019re not providing accurate information.\r\n\r\nFinally, I found the job to be repetitive and soul- destroying as you deal with 40/50 calls a day, the large majority of these customers are already irate before you speak to them because they\u2019ve been waiting in a queue for 40-50 minutes (on a good day). \r\n\r\nThis job could be for some people but not for myself, the \u2018call-centre\u2019 environment has a low \u2018ceiling\u2019 when it comes to progression and pay, the mortgage department was littered with employees who had been in the job for 10-15 years and were still earning \u00a317,500, for people with ambition I would say the \u2018call-centre\u2019 is not for you."}, {"review_title": "Great place to learn and grow vertically", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent learning potential, supportive colleagues, international collaboration", "cons": "Work life balance, high street banks pay more"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work if you need slow paced environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Mar 2021", "job_title": "AVP-Finance in Hooghly", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great people; great managers and great culture", "cons": "Not competitive bonus; less work"}, {"review_title": "Worlds local bank", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Project Manager in Krak\u00f3w", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company for an international career with a lot of opportunities", "cons": "sometimes difficult to navigate in huge organization"}, {"review_title": ".......", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "14 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Project Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good exposure and wider international experience", "cons": "no work life balance, Bit lilttle too micro management"}, {"review_title": "bad", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Mar 2021", "job_title": "PBC in Melbourne", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "very asian style work place", "cons": "plz thing about it twice"}, {"review_title": "universal banker", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Universal Banker in Hong Kong", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "you can learn a lot of things", "cons": "very busy and always OT"}], [{"review_title": "Friendly enviroment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Krak\u00f3w", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly enviroment, Professional, helping to feel comfortable", "cons": "Problem with work life balance"}, {"review_title": "Good company to work with", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Trainee Software Engineer in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good worklife balance.
