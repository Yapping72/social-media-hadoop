Upper management talk about mental health & how much they do, but it's empty words. They try to show how diverse & inclusive they are but its superficial & concerns aren't taken seriously. You're made to feel like it's your fault for interpreting it 'incorrectly'. Staff outside of BTB speak to BTB as if they are dirt beneath their shoes. You'r expected to do ABCDEF but given no support & very little guidance. They will not train you no matter how much you ask, always making up excuses as to why you cannot be trained on more lines. Keeping in mind, that if you are trained on all lines, you can move up a grade level. They have also recently gotten rid of this accreditation meaning you're stuck at the lowest level. Software & procedures are out of date, slow & difficult to use. You are not a bank worker so are expected to work bank holidays. Shifts are badly designed so at times you can be the only person from your management group on the phone. Referrals for customer questions are painful - half the time there is nobody available to answer so you're waiting 5 minutes +. Other half of the time, depending on who answers, you'll have a different solution.
