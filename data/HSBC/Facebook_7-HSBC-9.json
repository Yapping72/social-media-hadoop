Another negative is there is a global standards assessment all employees must now take and pass with an 80% grade to impress regulators and integrity monitor. This assessment is to be taken on an annual basis. Unfortunately, the wording of the test is flawed. It's a multiple choice/true false subjective test that his resulted in massive failures. These \"global standards\" often contradict the procedures employees are given by their line managers resulting in massive chaos. In many respects this bank does not know what its doing. HSBC claims they have a \"culture of transformation\" to correct the mistakes of the past. That was true under CEO Irene Donner.
