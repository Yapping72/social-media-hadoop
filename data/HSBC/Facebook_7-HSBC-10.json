Many companies claim to be global by nature of having offices everywhere. But at HSBC there is far more global collaboration than what I've experienced elsewhere. If you serve your time, there are opportunities to move internationally as well. The majority of people I work with are not from Canada even though we all work out of the same office now.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, corporate values are fairly open. Right now for example, HSBC is sponsoring a few events for World Pride. Internally there are posters encouraging employees to participate in Pride events as well. World Cup 2014 is currently in full swing in Brazil and many employees are taking full advantage of excellent TV coverage to watch games, participate in pools etc. So there is definitely a light-hearted aspect of HSBC which is embraced.", "cons": "I consider my pay to be low. The time-off policy is not overly restrictive, but it's an oddity to me in that you get x days off (depends on seniority) but if you're sick that counts as time off. So you're not supposed to take 100% of your time off as vacation, but rather leave a day or 2 \"in the bank\" just in case you get sick.\r\n\r\nThe biggest con of HSBC Canada though is that there's no sense of urgency in anything and thus no sense of direction. To me it feels like I'm working with a gigantic blob of Jello. The mass kind of jiggles and moves in a direction that's roughly forward, but it's really slow going. And when you contribute your bit, the mass just kind of jiggles some more without really feeling like there's forward momentum. \r\n\r\nWithout a sense of urgency, everything just slows down as people ease up. So we end up doing stupid things like creating spreadsheets which then need to be manually copied to Powerpoint which then gets emailed out as an update which no one really pays attention to anyway. But hey - we have a deck and somehow that's perceived as being a Good Thing.\r\n\r\nPeople development does not seem to be a priority either. As a new hire I was thrown 20 or so web-based trainings (which taught me nothing new really) and I got to attend a couple of conference call / trainings. Other than that, I find I need to rely on my own initiative to learn how stuff really works at HSBC and who does what. There is essentially no formal training for on boarding a new employee and as far as I can tell, no policy for internal training let alone external third-party training courses. I suppose if I build a case and ask I might be allowed to attend some course somewhere, but it's up to me and my initiative.

You can work from home whenever you want. Some people basically work from home all the time and only pop in to the office once or maybe twice per week. Other people go to a branch and work from there instead of making the trek in to downtown. Essentially HSBC doesn't care where you work so long as you work. It's an interesting perspective.\r\n\r\n- Good use of technology. Related to above, use of tech in HSBC is high. Laptops all come with soft phones that actually work as well as video conferencing. In the downtown offices, video conferencing is normal and pretty much everyone knows or figures out very quickly how to work the tech on laptops and in the various meeting rooms. The state of tech in meeting rooms is taken pretty seriously and if something is broken, it gets fixed very quickly.\r\n\r\n- Opportunities for international placement are incredible. HSBC is perhaps, the most international of the global financial companies. They really do operate basically everywhere. Moving from one geography to another is actively encouraged if that's what you want. When you do move, there's a well-oiled machine to take care of you. Movers will come and move your stuff; they actually pack and unpack everything. A tax expert will take care of your income taxes for a couple of years to ensure that everything transitions properly. A very informative website will help you figure out how to rent a new place at your destination, how to hire household help if applicable, how to find a good school for the kids, what you need to know about getting a driver's licence, where the good restaurants and grocery stores are ...\r\n\r\n- Related to above, working with international colleagues is baked in to the company DNA. You're never in a national silo; it's very normal to work with people around the world and to share ideas effortlessly.", "cons": "- Training at HSBC is nil. You do get the usual web-based training modules but those are all so that HSBC can claim they've trained all employees on ethics, anti-money laundering etc. The training you need to be successful at your actual job simply doesn't exist. You need to figure it all out on your own and you need to figure it out very quickly.\r\n\r\n- Management politics completely obscure the ability to be truly successful. Middle, and I suspect upper, management spends inordinate amounts of effort and time managing up instead of taking care of the people who report to them. This is not isolated as I both saw and experienced this phenomenon across roles and across different departments. Middle management is mostly concerned about presenting a good story as opposed to managing the issues. Real business problems and correspondingly, real business opportunities go unresolved because it's more important to spin a good tale than to actually move things forward.\r\n\r\n- Because of management politics, motion is mistaken for progress. As long as you can show that you're \"busy\" you'll generally be OK. But actually accomplishing things is of relatively minimal importance. \r\n\r\n- Again, because of management politics, coming up with a good tale to make your boss look good is of paramount importance. With an attitude like this, it's really no wonder that HSBC has been plagued by scandals and multi-million and sometimes multi-billion dollar fines from regulators. If you think HSBC is operating above board on everything, you're completely off base. People are working to show that they're adding profit at any cost. So long as the profits roll and so long as no one is caught, that's perfectly OK. \r\n\r\n- Your immediate supervisor will be given wide latitude over your progress at HSBC. If you get a good boss, you're golden. If you get a bad boss, you could end up in a very bad situation. This is made possible because HR is completely non-existent at the employee level. There is little to no local HR support. Calling HR gets you to a call centre in the Philippines where you can \"press 1 for ...\". Once you get to a live agent, you generally get some useless answer.\r\n\r\n- I called HR once for an issue I was trying to deal with. The agent gave me the name of someone I could email. When I looked that person up, it turned out that I was being referred to the Senior VP of HR in my country as opposed to an HR business partner which is what I asked for in the first place. (I did not email the SVP and my HR issue was never resolved.)\r\n\r\n- Management politics (are you seeing a theme yet?) means that senior management tend to treat certain geographies as stepping stones. So they parachute in, do their tour of duty for 3-4 years, then move on to bigger and better things. This leads to a somewhat short-term focus on (the illusion of) results as opposed to tackling real business issues. It's the old focus on quarterly benefits instead of looking to play long-term.\r\n\r\n- The time off policy is bizarre. You get say, 20 days off which sounds great. But if you're sick, that counts as a day. So you really have to manage if you should call in sick or if you should drag yourself in to work just so you can save a day off.\r\n\r\n- HSBC is huge on security. You can't print without swiping your passcard. Everything you do with HSBC equipment is highly monitored. I get it that it's company equipment and the company reserves the right to check up on things. But the degree to which HSBC takes this is, in my opinion, extreme. Certain documents for example, cannot be printed without filling out a security requisition form. Again, in some cases I get it but in many cases the degree of security becomes a barrier to doing your job effectively.\r\n\r\n- As a result of the focus on security, the ability to just talk to your colleagues about various work issues is curtailed. Some projects are code-word only and employees are forced to sign very strict NDAs. Of course, once the project is implemented everyone learns about it. I never did see a project implementation that I felt justified this level of internal security. Certainly there are some things you don't want the competition to find out ahead of time, but internally I think things can be handled differently.\r\n\r\n- There is a high level of entitlement at HSBC. If you've been there x number of years, there's a general attitude that you're due a promotion or some level of benefits. Earning your benefits is secondary to time served.\r\n\r\n- In part because HSBC is such a giant beast, and in part because HR is essentially non-existent at the local level, employees are treated as assets. Which is to say, they are used in the production of various bank services, and they are depreciated over their useful life span. At the end of their life span, they are written off then disposed. In other words, don't expect any corporate thanks just because you may have done a good job."}, {"review_title": "Mid-Corporate Banking Overview", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Nov 2017", "job_title": "Senior Relationship Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "HSBC US has the following attributes:\r\n\r\n-Brand.\r\n-Global Connectivity.\r\n-People/Peers.", "cons": "-Complicated and slow delivery of credit, cash management and other bank products to existing and prospective clients.\r\n-Convoluted Client/Prospect Onboarding Process.\r\n-Management (a lot of managers don't have the understanding, skillset or experience to be in their roles).\r\n-Production Focus  and Framework changes every 3-6 months.\r\n-Antiquated and outdated systems in every aspect.\r\n-Annual Reductions in Workforce, even if you are performing and doing the right thing).\r\n-Compensation (don't expect annual increases and/or bonuses).\r\n-KYC/CDD Nightmares\r\n-Lingering Deferred Prosecution Agreement (The DPA)\r\n-Diversity-other than white women in Sr. Leadership/Management, there are very few people of \"color\" in CMB or Mid-Corporate Banking."}, {"review_title": "Distinctly average - undervalued", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "3 Apr 2018", "job_title": "Digital Business Analyst in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People - amongst the journey men...who are to be expected \n\nThere are some truly amazing people here \nOften undervalued but who genuinely believe and fight for the right things - not just their own careers.
