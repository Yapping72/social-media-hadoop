Some complaints were ignored by the higher management\n6) ZERO allowances on transportation costs, and since the parking isn't completed in TRX tower, you'll have to pay expensive parking fees and take shuttle buses to the building one hour earlier.\n7) HSBC Malaysia gave a lot of promises to staffs, yet it remained as 'promises', nothing more than fake hopes. Ex: They promised the staffs for flood assistance allowance to those affected by severe flood in December 2021 and furniture allowance for those working at home, yet it was nothing more than fake promises.\n8) You were taught to show empathy to your customers, yet as staffs, sometimes you were not given one by the upper management.\n9) You may be offered the same salary as those without a proper Diploma, despite you having few years of experience with a Bachelor Degree or Master. Clearly, HR in HSBC Malaysia is taking advantage against its staffs by prohibiting staffs to share their salaries amongst peers or group members so that the HR could benefit, rip off your worth, efforts and experience by paying you less and saves their costs.\n10) Some loyalists within HSBC might try to change your mind by not leaving the job. In fact, there are hundreds if not thousands of better paying jobs than in HSBC Malaysia. Never get discouraged to find a better one!\n11) High manpower turnover in HSBC Malaysia.

As the Mexican drug war metastasized in the mid-2000s, the bank provided essential U.S. dollar-denominated accounts to narco-gangs needing to clean hundreds of millions of dollars in drug earnings. The cartels designed specially shaped boxes that fit HSBC\u2019s teller windows to deliver the massive amounts of illicit cash pouring in.\r\nIn 2010, the bank was forced to submit to another court order secured by its primary regulator, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The bank promised to boost anti-money-laundering systems and provide compliance officers with more information about its clients \u2014 again.\r\nIn the summer of 2012, the U.S. Senate investigative panel released its 339-page report on the bank\u2019s work with Mexican narco-gangs and its role in terrorist financing. Later that year, the Justice Department and HSBC reached their deferred-prosecution agreement. Critics cast the government\u2019s decision to forgo indictment of the bank or any of its executives as a sign of big banks\u2019 virtual impunity from meaningful consequences for their misdeeds.\r\n\r\nJune 2012\r\nOn June 20, 2012, the same day HSBC\u2019s attorneys were describing the bank\u2019s anti-money-laundering protocols to Senate investigators on Capitol Hill, HSBC\u2019s Hong Kong branch began transmitting funds for a shell company called Trade Leader Corp. Ltd.\r\nBy February 2014, transfers into and out of the shell company\u2019s Hong Kong accounts totaled more than $581 million.\r\nRecords from the FinCEN Files show that, when the bank\u2019s U.S. compliance staff asked for information about who owned the big-dollar account, HSBC\u2019s Hong Kong bankers simply responded that there was \u201cnone available.\u201d\r\nAccording to a review of data collected by an ICIJ media partner, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Trade Leader Corp. Ltd. was a major East Asian node in the \u201cRussian Laundromat,\u201d a sprawling network that moved criminally tainted money from former Soviet states to the West. Incorporated in Hong Kong, Trade Leader lists one company official in its 2015 filing in the Hong Kong corporate registry, a director whose address is an apartment unit in a decaying Soviet-era building in the far-eastern Russian city of Novosibirsk.\r\nIn 2014, Hong Kong\u2019s corporate registry listed Trade Leader\u2019s sole shareholder as a company called INHK Ltd. In an email to ICIJ, Trade Leader\u2019s registration agent, a firm called Intercorp Asia, acknowledged that INHK\u2019s only purpose was to hide Trade Leader\u2019s true owner, known as the \u201cultimate beneficial owner,\u201d or UBO.\r\nINHK does not have \u201cany business activity and [is] used to hide the real UBO information in [the] company registry of HK,\u201d Alex Orso, an Intercorp representative wrote. He declined to share further information about Trade Leader.\r\nTrade Leader was not an isolated case. Though documenting only a tiny fraction of HSBC\u2019s activities during this period, the FinCEN Files reveal a striking tolerance of questionable customers within HSBC\u2019s Hong Kong branch.\r\nICIJ analyzed nearly $1.5 billion in transactions that flowed through shell companies holding commercial accounts with HSBC Hong Kong between 2011 and 2016. In each case, HSBC filed SARs that failed to include fundamental facts about the bank\u2019s own big-dollar customers, including who owned the accounts, what countries the owners lived in, and where the money came from.\r\nThe U.S. Senate\u2019s 2012 report on HSBC highlighted the danger of bank compliance officers remaining in the dark about such basic information.\r\n\u201cInformation sharing was one of the major things HSBC promised they were going to do,\u201d said Elise Bean, lead author of the Senate report and former aide to then-Sen. Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan.\r\nThe FinCEN files show that HSBC broke the pledge repeatedly.\r\n\r\nMid- 2013\r\n\r\nIn mid-2013, a shell company client, Vic Charm Ltd., sent or received more than $80 million through HSBC Hong Kong accounts during the first several months of the bank\u2019s probation. HSBC compliance officers listed virtually nothing about the firm, aside from a series of Hong Kong addresses linked to it and the name of an owner, about whom the officers said they knew nothing, not even the person\u2019s country of residence. In 2015, prosecutors in Malawi alleged that the shell company had received $3.8 million in a scheme to launder money out of the resource-deprived country.\r\nThe case remains pending, according to a statement from the Reserve Bank of Malawi, which is involved in pressing the laundering charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2013-2014. \r\n\r\nFinCEN Files documents show that HSBC knew regulators were investigating its customer, the WCM Ponzi scheme, even as it helped move its money.\r\nA federal class-action lawsuit brought by bilked investors alleged that HSBC Hong Kong was \u201cinstrumental in helping WCM777 to continue its Ponzi scheme.\u201d A federal judge dismissed the suit last month, ruling it had been brought in an improper jurisdiction.\r\nIn an exclusive interview with ICIJ, the Ponzi scheme\u2019s bow-tie-sporting founder, Ming Xu, said HSBC did not contact him to ask about massive money flows WCM was moving through the bank\u2019s Hong Kong accounts.\r\nIn September 2013, not long before financial regulators around the world announced investigations into the business, the leaders of WCM moved the Ponzi scheme\u2019s headquarters from Los Angeles to Hong Kong.\r\nIn October, Colombia\u2019s then-President Juan Manuel Santos announced that the national police would launch an investigation into allegedly illegal activities by the business. Three days later, HSBC compliance officers filed the first of several suspicious activity reports related to WCM accounts, noting that more than $6 million in transactions had moved through a single account over the preceding three months. The SAR said an internet search had revealed \u201cPonzi allegations\u201d against the business.\r\nFour months later, in February 2014, HSBC filed another suspicious activity report on the scheme, saying WCM had received or sent $15 million between 2013 and early 2014 through its HSBC Hong Kong account and company accounts with other banks to which HSBC provided U.S. dollar services. By then, authorities in Peru, Colombia, California and Massachusetts had publicly launched civil or criminal investigations into the company.\r\nYet massive dollar amounts kept flowing into the Hong Kong account.\r\nShane Riedel, a former HSBC compliance executive who now runs a Berlin-based anti-money-laundering consultancy, says a bank in this situation should take action.\r\n\u201cIf a Ponzi scheme is flagged in one country and the accounts are not closed in another, that\u2019s not a mistake,\u201d Riedel said, citing banks\u2019 often inadequate systems for analyzing and sharing compliance information.\r\nIn March 2014, HSBC compliance officers filed yet another suspicious activity report on WCM, whose business continued to hum despite intense law enforcement scrutiny around the globe. Four days after the report was filed, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a restraining order that sought to freeze the company\u2019s bank accounts.\r\nBut even after the SEC order, WCM\u2019s accounts at HSBC remained highly active. According to court documents later filed by attorneys appointed by the SEC to seek restitution for the scheme\u2019s victims, WCM drained more than $7 million from the accounts during the following week, drawing its balance to zero.\r\nHSBC\u2019s 2010 cease-and-desist order stipulated that the bank must examine its handling of subpoenas and law enforcement inquiries. Eleven days after the restraining order, HSBC Hong Kong formally declined to comply with a U.S. court\u2019s subpoena for records.\r\n\u201cOur bank is outside the jurisdiction of U.S. courts,\u201d HSBC Hong Kong\u2019s law firm said in a letter to lawyers seeking money for victims. By February 2015, the bank had not provided account information to the attorneys. As a result, \u201cthe cost of tracing these funds overseas will be very expensive,\u201d the lawyers said in a court filing of the HSBC accounts and an account with UBS bank that had allegedly moved more than $2 million in transfers relating to the scam.\r\nThe SEC alleged that the scheme had used accounts at a variety of banks in addition to HSBC, but little is known about those accounts, including exactly how long they remained active. A summary of the forensic accounting report filed by the SEC-appointed lawyers focused largely on the HSBC Hong Kong accounts.\r\nMeanwhile, WCM executives bought golf courses in Southern California, million-dollar homes and vacant land in Santa Barbara County that the scheme\u2019s zealously religious founder, Ming Xu, told ICIJ was supposed to become a Christian \u201ccommunity of caring and sharing.\u201d\r\nIn early 2014, 29-year-old Elvis Callejas was working toward his dream of building a set of retail stores in Bolivia\u2019s rural northernmost region. But he was forced to lay off the men helping to construct the project when his savings of $10,000 evaporated in WCM\u2019s collapse. \u201cI realized that I had fallen into a trap,\u201d Callejas told ICIJ.\r\nCallejas found himself taking out loans to cover the sudden loss. \u201cThat is a very large amount of money here,\u201d Callejas said.\r\nReynaldo Pacheco, the WCM investor murdered in Napa County, was also not a rich man. According to local law enforcement, he had searched for years for business opportunities and believed that WCM was a legitimate investment. Three people were later convicted for his kidnapping and murder.\r\nMing Xu, denies that WCM was a Ponzi scheme and told ICIJ that the SEC had \u201cplundered\u201d him. When he returned to mainland China in early 2015, he started a new version of WCM there, according to Chinese court documents. In November of that year, Chinese authorities arrested Xu for related financial crimes. He was subsequently convicted and spent three years in prison.\r\nThe Chinese court documents in Xu\u2019s case state that his venture in China had accounts with a list of Chinese banks, along with a single global bank: HSBC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeb 2016\r\n\r\nIn February 2016, well into HSBC\u2019s probation period, bank compliance officers asked the Hong Kong branch about a suspected laundering operation involving a customer called Enjoy Trading Shanghai Co., but had received no response before filing a SAR one month later.\r\n\r\nMay 2016\r\n\r\nIn May of that year, the bank\u2019s compliance staffers filed a report on a former HSBC Hong Kong customer called Alahdin Limited, saying that documents posted to the internet alleged that more than half a trillion dollars in transactions had flowed through the firm. Relying on information received from HSBC\u2019s Hong Kong branch, the report offered almost no information about the company\u2019s ownership, listing Alahdin\u2019s owner with merely a first name and initials \u2014 \u201cSHAHUL H H M\u201d \u2014 along with an email address.\r\n\r\nThe report did not note that Alahdin, a company registered in Hong Kong, had two years prior changed its name to the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company Ltd. Little is known about this company, but it shares its name with one that decades ago created Pakarab Fertilizers Limited, a subsidiary of Pakistan\u2019s Fatima Group, according to the group\u2019s website. In 2012, U.S. military officials accused Fatima\u2019s fertilizer operations of providing chemicals used to make Taliban roadside bombs targeting U.S. and other coalition forces in Afghanistan.\r\nProfit Accounting Company Limited, a firm that Hong Kong registry documents say acted as Alahdin\u2019s corporate secretary, told ICIJ it had no record of ever having worked with the firm. Fatima Group did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\r\n\r\nJuly 2016\r\nIn July 2016, HSBC filed a suspicious activity report on a customer called Cool Distribution Ltd., which had sent or received more than $92 million between 2011 and 2015 through the bank\u2019s accounts. ICIJ\u2019s research found that $19 million of that amount went to a company run by a businessman who had been convicted in a 2015 tax fraud case in Bologna, Italy, involving Italian organized crime.\r\nThe SAR lists three names for Cool Distribution\u2019s owners, but without addresses, country of residence or other basic information. Two of the names have been linked to a Hong Kong financial fraud scandal, another belongs to a Russian intellectual property tycoon who denied to ICIJ knowing anything of Cool Distribution. HSBC\u2019s report listed a Dubai address for the company but searches of corporate registries in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates found no record of the firm.\r\n\r\nMarch 2017\r\nIn March 2017, HSBC filed a report on another suspected money laundering account \u2014 a shell company called Well Fortune HK Ltd., which had moved more than $167 million in transactions through HSBC accounts over more than five years. The bank listed addresses for the company in Russia and Hong Kong, an email address and the name of a purported owner but no other identifying information, including the person\u2019s country of residence.\r\nWell Fortune\u2019s 2014 filing in the Hong Kong corporate registry lists Adrian Matthew Bradley, a resident of Belize, as its sole shareholder. Bradley\u2019s name appears on records of dozens of shell companies around the world, according to leaked documents and public records. ICIJ sent requests for comment to Bradley\u2019s apparent email address, but received no response. Bradley is a \u201cdecoy name\u201d for a Ukrainian oligarch named Serhiy Kurchenko, according to an article published by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. Ukrainian prosecutors have accused Kurchenko of amassing millions of dollars via tax evasion and stealing from bank investors. In March 2014, the EU sanctioned him for his alleged links to state corruption. The following year, the U.S. sanctioned Kurchenko."}, {"review_title": "Good career", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Associate in Z\u00fcrich", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can move around a lot between departments", "cons": "Slow moving, not great pay,"}, {"review_title": "Job environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Financial Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work culture code of conduct", "cons": "There was No worklife balance"}, {"review_title": "merchant services", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great community great community  great community", "cons": "nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing"}], [{"review_title": "one time", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "work and life balance, colleagues are very nice", "cons": "the salary is too low"}, {"review_title": "Head Shared Services", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Head Of Operations in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work ethics\r\nLoads of opportunities\r\nStable Organization", "cons": "Lack of stable leadership direction \r\nTeams work on mostly volatile and short term goals"}, {"review_title": "AM", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Assistant CDD Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Medical benefit, good people to work with", "cons": "Nothing I can think of at this moment"}, {"review_title": "GAC Risk", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Senior Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Chill environment, Helpful people and timings are flexible", "cons": "Not a good pay and don't expect good bonuses please"}, {"review_title": "Poor pay for support positions", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits\r\nFlexible work \r\nSome innovation allowed", "cons": "Profit over values\r\nArchaic management structure\r\nNot easy to advance quickly"}, {"review_title": "great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Project Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "fair and good and i enjoyed it", "cons": "too stressful not enough time in day"}, {"review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "31 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good training, good team work, flexible hours", "cons": "A lot of pressure to get extra sales"}, {"review_title": "Workload is always more than the benefit", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Associate Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The company is a well established bank.", "cons": "Too many politics in the office.

There are way too many chefs in the kitchen and none of them have ever cooked before, but don't want to admit that.\r\n- Completely outdated technology with no motivation or meaningful effort to update\r\n- Nobody cares about the work that they do, so quality and motivation are low. And you can't blame them because of all the hurdles that they have to go through to make any changes, only to have it reverted because someone didn't understand the requirements.\r\n- Highly siloed teams, with no effort from management to encourage collaboration, or enable sharing of knowledge\r\n- Left hand doesn't know what the right one is doing. Upper management has no visibility into what each team is doing, so can't provide any meaningful input on overlapping areas of work.\r\n- Regional isolationism. Specific sites will bunker down on practices and procedures, and out of sure principle, refuse to follow global standards\r\n- Your feedback will not be listened to because nobody feels like it's their responsibility. Lack of ownership of anything due to the highly siloed and distributed teams leads to things getting lost in the churn or just ignored because nobody knows who to report things to.\r\n- Upper Management has mastered the art of using as many words as possible to say nothing. AMAs are completely pointless, you will receive nothing more than business talk and no answers.\r\n- Reporting channels are largely useless, nobody actions any feedback. Because there is no motivation for them to make things better or protect their workers. \r\n- Management annual review is a joke. They elect who gives them feedback.\r\n- Incentive system is insulting. I was recognized by my boss for excellent work over the year and received points to use on an internal store that added up to about 1/5th of what was needed to redeem a HSBC branded t-shirt.\r\n\r\nThis place is a catastrophe.
