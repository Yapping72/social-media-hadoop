That's one of the main reasons behind why I joined Revolut, which is still my main financial product and something I value as a user. Unfortunately, the company behind it is terrible. \r\n\r\nI'm not saying Revolut is a bad choice for everyone, because it's not. \r\n\r\nWhat I am saying is that if you value your personal time, mental health, and psychological safety and want to work in an environment that appreciates you and the art of the craft over office politics, don't fall into the trap of trading the above for a higher pay. Trust me, it's not worth it.\r\n\r\nPlus, don't buy into the allure of the higher pay. In practice, despite paying above average on paper, when you factor in the very common 12-14 hour days that many employees need to work day in and day out, the hourly pay is actually way below average.\r\n\r\nMy story:\r\nWhen joining Revolut, I was sold on the promise of a young startup with a great product, lots of learning and growth opportunities, and which pays well. \r\n\r\nThe reality is I left with a severe case of burnout, depression and anxiety that landed me in therapy, unemployed for a while due to the mental situation it brought me to, and with a massive bill to pay for all of it.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to say I had a full rebound since and I've since joined a company that actually cares about its employees, and which I have a leadership role at now. So if I was able to find a much better alternative company, I'm sure you can too. \r\n\r\nMy experience:\r\n1. Extreme micromanagement, coming from the top - it's very common for the CEO to schedule 2-3 review meetings each week with Product Owners and Designers where he'd publicly criticize their work without having much context\r\n\r\n2. Unrealistic KPIs and targets - these are also often dictated from the top, and they're aggressive to the point that they're just plain unrealistic. However, not meeting them can cost you your job or have an impact on your pay\r\n\r\n3. Hypocritical values - there are tons of examples here, but Think Deeper is the one that first comes to mind. Revolut preaches using logical reasoning for decision making and seeking for the truth in data, yet again the CEO had a mandate to basically ban any form of A/B testing or experimentation. I even know someone that was largely fired because he tried to experiment to understand what users really want, instead of just blinding listening to subjective opinions from senior leadership\r\n\r\n4. Insanely high employee churn - given how many people were constantly leaving, I had to learn how to work with new people so often that it almost became a job in itself. After I left, a lot of my team did so too in the following months\r\n\r\n5. A lot of incompetent leadership - I don't want to generalize too broadly here as my manager was actually someone I respected, but a lot of the senior leadership found its way through office politics and through blindly following directions from the very top, and most of that leadership team was far from being able to do what their roles implied and actually lead people\r\n\r\n6. Disguised employee perks - in my view, perks should act as benefits for the staff. Some of them do, but many are actually just ways for the company to manipulate you into following its toxic practices. For example, is getting a 'free' dinner only if you stay at the office beyond 7 PM or 8 PM an actual perk? Or is it a shady tactic to get you to do unpaid overtime? I'll let you decide\r\n\r\n7. Hard to get the support you need - because the company culture only rewards those that are able to hit targets, that incentivizes everyone to be laser focus on their own area and not help others or collaborate much unless it's to their benefit. Unfortunately, that ends up sometimes affecting even the people that are very helpful by nature, and leads to a deep siloing issue\r\n\r\n8. Lack of psychological safety - there's a narrative that Revolut doesn't tolerate office politics, when in practice it's full of it. If you disagree with the CEO or some senior leadership folks or if you're unable to reach the unreasonable targets often set for you, you're basically at risk of being fired without any notice, and even publicly humiliated in group calls by having the CEO call you incompetent and dismissing your work (true story I was a witness to). Also, there's very little regard for people's situation, even if being let go implies losing their work permit from a country they moved to to join Revolut in the first place\r\n\r\nThere's a lot more to list here, but I'll conclude with the broken promises.\r\n\r\nI was granted a performance bonus for one of the time periods I was at the company for. However, most of that stock options grant got annulled at some point after my departure, despite (1) me leaving because a therapist diagnosed me with work-induced depression and anxiety, and recommended me to quit, and (2) the fact that the performance bonus was for a period during which I was still at the company for and for which I earner it"}, {"review_title": "Toxic work culture", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Global Mobility Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fast paced, use to data and tech in everyday work", "cons": "No human side in doing work. 17-19 hours work daily.

As a result people go crazy about hitting the targets, stay afterhours, burn out and start looking for another employment.

It has been a great learning curve for me and the product is great but unfortunately, I could not support the company culture any longer externally without feeling duplicitous. How Revolut treats its employees is inexcusable - there is a real sense internally that you are disposable and their approach to HR practises and employee relations/experience has been atrocious.  Whilst the appointment of  VP People with actual HR experience is a step in the right direction, it is quite frankly, too late. \r\n\r\nRevolut is an incredibly challenging environment to feel empowered to do your job. You will be micromanaged from day one and the culture is purely KPI driven in their push to be profitable. Don't get me wrong - KPIs are a great way to track performance against goals but here they are obsessed. As a result, individuals care more about meeting their own KPIs and there is less of a focus on collaboration and team work (despite it being a value) They have made some cracking hires but turnover remains high - either through people being managed out via quarterly performance reviews, or leaving because they are unable to do the job they are hired into because their ideas, creativity and experience (ie., what they've been hired for!) end up misaligned with those in senior leadership. \r\n\r\nThe language used at performance reviews here and throughout the company is aggressive and is also damaging to mental health (in addition to the unsustainable workloads and zero work/life balance) I never was made to feel that I was good enough to work at Revolut - you are either an A player (supposedly the top 5% of the company), or you're a B player (defined as Average+ internally) and you will spend the following 3 months until your next quartlery performance review wondering whether they will be your last. The sad thing is, to get anywhere in Revolut you have to promote this way of working and warped ideology that they are the worlds greatest sports team who only hire the best of the very best, and whilst there are some great people in the business, please trust me when I say that they are far from this. \r\n\r\nAs I said, there are some incredible people here that I am sad to no longer work alongside (the best of luck to you) but for my own sanity and feeling of self-worth, I am incredibly glad to have left the business. \r\n\r\nMy advice to candidates - use Revolut as a stepping stone or just ignore the call from Recruiters. There is no guaratee that you will be with the business in 3 / 6 / 9 months time and they are very open about this on their Culture page and admit that they will literally pay you to leave if you're good, but not the best (!!)

Working extra hours is almost a norm (which wasn't a big issue for me). The COO calls out individuals publicly in large meetings and puts them on the spot for even a small change in due-date. In many cases, the individual may not even have committed to that due date and the due-date was just assumed by management. \r\n- Leaders don't have people management skills. They use the term 'crack the whip' to describe some of the work they have to do.\r\n- Engineers are seldom involved in solution design because solution design often happens in meetings with senior leaders where engineers are not invited to. This results in a frustrating process.\r\n- Product Ownership here is a lot about tactical project management that relies on the traditional 'business requirements' concept, rather than discovery-led product management that uses design-thinking to build better products. \r\n- Day-to-day involves putting out operational fires (at least once a week to every other day). This is very distracting from the work you want to do. This is because 'you own the product' and so you own the fire as well. If you don't put out the fires, it'll trigger risk indicators that may lead to you being fired.\r\n- There is an emphasis on quantifying everything, even if it comes at the cost of productivity, morale, or peace of mind. \r\n- Employee turnover is quite high, but never have I heard any senior leaders or execs asking for any feedback on how they could be better or what can be done differently.\r\n- There are a few more but the above are the more important ones I feel."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Customer Specialist in Wroc\u0142aw", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Teamwork communication flexibility in work hours", "cons": "i faced a bit of racism"}, {"review_title": "Not for the faint of heart or lazy", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They issue stock options like they do not have a limited supply\r\nBleeding edge technology with lightning fast development and deployment\r\nRemote work preferred\r\nSmall team where everyone contributes\r\nUnlimited Possibilities", "cons": "Name recognition isn't that of Facebook or Amazon, being a European Borderless Bank, very few people in the US have heard of Revolut.\r\nJob Titles are under the European naming convention so their seniority and scope may be deceiving to the casual passersby.

Many other reviews I see here are just bashful; you have to think how mature are these 'somewhat experienced' people if they're taking time out of their days to bash a company online? Moreover I have been at Revolut for quite a long time, I've learned an immeasurable amount. There was another review which I found useful so I will use a similar structure.\r\n\r\nSelf Learning\r\nRevolut enables us to tackle problems that are entirely unique and consecutively encourages us to seek unique solutions. The majority of my team (+ others) is quite young, meaning we spend a lot of time diving into the data and business without clear guidance. For the thinkers out there, this is ideal. \r\n\r\nLess Hierarchical Politics\r\nHaving worked at larger corporates in the past - I can confidently say there is much less of this at Revolut. It is often the case that you will debate against seniority (e.g the 'experienced' people) - this is the key to success. Seniority often leads to complacency and misplaced ego, you must be willing to question your own assumptions and take criticism from others - how else can you grow? \r\n\r\nData & Logic First\r\nNo decisions are made with a \"because-I-said-so\" attitude. While some may see it as that, they are clearly not understanding the logic behind such decisions. Due to the speed of growth and collective ambition of employees, there is no room for assumptions. Revolut bases all decisions on data where it is available. Many 'experienced' hires are unable to accept this since they're accustomed to common practices. If the vision is to create something new for the world, how could we possibly do this by following in the footsteps of those we're trying to replace?\r\n\r\nCulture\r\nThis may seem odd since the majority of the reviews question our culture. Yes, it is true that we have some internal qualms. Yes, it is true that we don't have many fluffy events and zoo retreats. But what is the marginal utility of these gimmicks? Large technology companies have capital to support such activities and as a result have now skewed the market's perception of culture. To be successful at Revolut, vision should be your culture. A vision for your team, a vision for the product and a vision for the company. It comes with its sacrifices - but what doesn't? Moreover, the Data Science team at Revolut is exceptionally collaborative and friendly with one another. We arrange many of our own activities, share learning resources and constantly discuss new projects we can tackle to improve the product.\r\n\r\nGrowth\r\nIt is quite obvious the several of the brightest people at Revolut will be future founders. There are many ambitious employees who yearn to make an impact and change things.  They work a lot out of a sincere addiction to what they do and subsequently they get rewarded. It is astonishing how young most people are but despite this they are incredibly mature.", "cons": "Lack of Guidance\r\nMany employees prefer to have guidance or experience to learn from. As a result we have a misalignment between employees and the way Revolut operates. It is not wrong to desire guidance - but it is equally important to be confident enough in yourself to know that you can achieve the same status as such 'experienced' people. It obviously would be beneficial to have a few intelligent people with some extra years of knowledge - but finding ones who are willing to adapt and learn is difficult.\r\n\r\nLack of Knowledge of Fundamentals\r\nAlthough Revolut is packed full of intelligent people, this does not mean they are always wise. Some display heavy oversight or a lack of understanding of fundamentals - so they play into the 'buzz' and don't solve problems in the most efficient way. This stretches from Data Science to Engineering. Just as a surgeon goes through an extensive training regime covering a giant stretch of fundamentals - so should a technical hire (irrespective of his/her past work experience or seniority). This is a problem which has been fixed over the past few months in the Data Science team.\r\n\r\nLack of Leadership Amongst Technical Hires\r\nUnfortunately some technical hires jump away from responsibility and display little to no leadership qualities at all. Engineers should grasp the product, vision and business logic of the code they're writing instead of behaving as cogs in a machine. LEADERSHIP is what will drive culture and productivity forward - nobody should be telling you to take on these qualities, it is something you should do own your own."}, {"review_title": "Love it - great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* you can have a real impact at the company\r\n* great opportunities, talented colleagues\r\n* one of the most exciting start ups to be at\r\n* you really see how the company is growing and developing\r\n* high performance culture", "cons": "* long hours sometimes necessary (important to love what you do)\r\n* can encounter more red tape than at most startups"}, {"review_title": "Great Worklife Balance", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Business Development Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You can manage your own time, job based on results and KPIs", "cons": "High pressure job always looking for the best in you"}], [{"review_title": "Not worth it, go somewhere else", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Intelligent and ambitious peers, big opportunity for impact", "cons": "Truly horrible work culture.\nCompensation for some roles is below market.\nYou are just a resource to your manager and to the company, not a human.\nVery little diversity whatsoever."}, {"review_title": "All good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Kyc Specialist in Krak\u00f3w", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "young team and very modern", "cons": "I do not see any bad here so far"}, {"review_title": "Higher salaries than other cx support jobs, but with other cons", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 May 2021", "job_title": "Customer Support Agent in Matosinhos, Oporto", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "+ salary higher by 100-300 euros than other similar jobs;\n+ (before Covid times): plenty of office food and snacks with everything that you could imagine, plus pizza Fridays;\n+ challenging and cool environment;", "cons": "- work exhaustion related to job role;\n- overly polite/rigid office atmosphere at times;\n- diminishing of transparency from top to bottom levels due to complexity and nature of the structure / corporate politics;"}, {"review_title": "Challenging and tense, with its perks and pitfalls", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Operations Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Overall smart colleagues\n- Open mindedness and little politics, so it's easy to get done in two weeks things that in a standard bank would take three months\n- Good scope for career progression if ready to take on ownership\n- Building an awesome product\n- Fair, but not excellent compensation and benefits\n- Good name to have on the cv", "cons": "- Micromanagement from some executives\n- Over emphasis on the KPIs where the underlying reality ceases to exist, to the point of taking some bad business decision just to raise the KPI of few percentage points\n- Service teams change processes different times per quarter, yet expect other teams to comply to botched up processes.

Nothing about travel was mentioned before getting the job. I have a child I need to look after with my wife. Also there was an expectation to soon travel to Poland for a week. I agreed, then the day before the Leeds trip, as nothing had been communicated to me (train tickets, accommodation) I asked my manager what's happening. She said you're no longer going. Great. Thanks for the heads up. I've made childcare plans but fine. \r\n\r\nI never really knew what I was supposed to be doing and what I was doing was pretty boring. Training was pretty much non existent. Also, my 'manager' I found wasn't actually my manager but someone who had their own role who was just looking after the team.

So i had no idea what i needed to do to pass it. Again I asked but no one knew. My 'manager' went AWOL after about 4 weeks of me joining & never returned. Wasn't told why. Team then really rudderless. \r\n\r\nThen lockdown hit. I together with my working wife had to look after our child as nurseries were shut. This massively impacted the amount of work I could do as I was obviously sharing childcare. This meant I couldn't hit whatever the KPIs were. I explained this to my new manager who said yes it must be difficult, but again next week asked why I hadn't hit targets, I explained because of childcare & round in circles we went. Basically Revolut didn't care about that - I needed to hit targets no matter what. \r\n\r\nIn the end they made my who team redundant and said it was nothing to do with Covid. The decision was made before Covid. So why was I hired then because I joined just before Covid hit??? Blatent lie by Revolut who didn't want a bad rep by making people redundant during the crisis. \r\n\r\nOverall, in my experience, this was a company that didn't really know what it was doing and was making it up as it went along.

It currently doesn\u2019t matter if you are a high performing individual who values human decency, be prepared to have your head on the guillotine. Yes. Revolut currently reminds me of medieval Europe, with the CEO  wielding the axe, and you just waiting for when your name will be called up and your head to be on the chopping board in the middle of a pandemic. \r\n\r\nA description as above merits a full explanation and a bit of history. \r\n\r\nAs someone who has been with Revolut almost two years, I think I have a good overview and insights to this whole traumatic debacle of a company. Yes, the horror stories of Revolut you read in the media and the reviews you see here are all true. Being female, I knew that joining Revolut was going to be tough. I didn\u2019t realise it was going to be hell. In late 2018 to early 2019, the culture was already cut throat. If you were female and didn\u2019t break down and cry that month, that was a great month for you. I have had female colleagues who cried every day the first week they joined. Me myself? There were so many times I found myself crying in the office toilets, something I have never done in my career before. I had expletives yelled at me in public. I was told my work was stupid or dumb as ......\r\n\r\nIn Feb 2019, the first Wired article broke out and that hit the company badly. Customers were threatening to cut up their cards and media backlash was spiraling. The CEO realised he had to do something. The people team was expanded, and they tried to put in place better processes and improve culture overall. It was a great effort by those involved but with complete lack of buy-in from the CEO and his right-hand man.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Revolut was still in its hyper-growth mentality. All leads were pressured to hire and grow headcount. Heads of departments were told by the CEO that if they didn\u2019t spend 50% of their time on hiring, they were not doing their jobs. As the second half of the 2019 went by, the company started to become bloated and many of the newer joiners were starting to get more complacent (by complacent, I mean leaving at 5pm-6pm which is a big no-no). \r\n\r\nThen, funding round came. With the IPO failures of both Uber and Wework, investors were now hyper-obsessed with profitability. Gone were the days where success of a startup was by their number of users. Suddenly, Revolut found itself being scrutinised left right center on how they would actually turn a profit. The game was changing. \r\n\r\nBack from vacation in Jan 2020, the CEO decided to crack his whip and get the complacent company in shape. Everyone who was underperforming were fired without warnings. I would call that the first wave of the culling. Performance reviews were changes from every 6 months to every 3. Suddenly, you only had 3 months to hit your KPIs. New joiners were told on their first day they joined that HR\u2019s KPI was to ensure there were no underperformers (ie, you don\u2019t hit your KPIs, you\u2019re fired.)\r\n\r\nThe second culling came after the first quarter, with yet more heads being axed if they were not performing. And then the pandemic got under way. The company was desperate to cut its headcount and so they started targeting people who were performing but were not directly helping the company make money. I would say that hundreds across the company got axed including a huge amount from the London headquarters. Not all made it to the official number of redundancies which was at 60+ because the company was obsessed with trying to downplay it\u2019s official numbers so to look better compared to Monzo and Starling. Many people were forced to resign, or were told they were being let go for \u201cunderperformance.\u201d As in the UK if your tenure is below 2 years, you are not entitled to get due process for your firing for underperformance, the company exploited this legal loophole to fire many people. \r\n\r\nThere were many international employees, many who upended their lives, suddenly finding themselves thrown out on the streets by Revolut without a job, barely anytime left on their visas and virtually no flights back home to their home countries IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. Revolut expected their employees to give their all to the company and demanded that, yet had no qualms deserting these very people they demanded loyalty from during the pandemic. \r\n\r\nThose left in Revolut now suddenly found themselves having to take on the the jobs and KPIs of the people fired along with their crazy amount, and to achieve them or be fired themselves. Heads and team leads, who would rather resign, are so fearful that if they leave, there would be no one to protect their team, are working themselves to death because they are told if their team does not achieve the team KPI, headcount will be cut. The CEO has basically used the pandemic to drive fear within the employees and hold their livelihoods and feed themselves and family at ransom, in exchange for working conditions bordering ghastly human exploitation. \r\n\r\nPlease avoid like plague. Don't leave a cushy secure job now only to join Revolut and then be fired within 2/3 months (without probation not renewed). Their modus operandi for firing you will be giving you the excuse you 'underperformed', and then you're left stranded in the middle of a pandemic with no job.

I must be clear that this is not paid over time, this is working 14 hours for 8 hours pay. This behaviour is encouraged the Team Leaders. \r\n\r\n\"Officially\" This does not happen, \"In Reality\" they say it is your choice, but if you do not do these additional hours, you may not reach the inflexible target KPI's, you will be terminated. As you cannot simply move to another job in Poland you end up working a slave for Revolut. \r\n\r\nThe company has the same kind of ethics as brands such as Nike and Apple, they deliver a seemingly great product on the front end, but the price of human suffering in the back end is huge.\r\n\r\nBeing friendly and outgoing is seen as a weakness and as such you will find that your Polish and Russian speaking colleagues will basically pretend that you do not exist. You can attempt to greet or speak with them, but expect to be dismissed quickly.\r\n\r\nDue to the Hot Desking setup, you will find that particually male Polish agents can be extremely territorial and often exhibit visible signs of frustration and agressive body language when a foreigner sits in what they consider to be their \"Zone\". They also believe that we cannot understand Polish and as such are careless about their conversations in their native language. Many which revealed that sadly the team were happy to work for an international company for the money and benefits, but were pretty vocal about foreigners taking jobs from Poles, foreigners not being able to perform well enough and general comments about immigrants that made me feel sad and unwelcome.\r\n\r\nI was shocked to see that Xenophobic, ationalist type attitudes were openly on display at an apparently forward thinking company. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the unnerving racism other issues included, being paid late as the accountant won't pay for elixir transfer (5PLN) which means people are left without funds and unable to pay bills. Benefits promised suddenly being ripped away without explanation. Taxi service is useless and takes hours to get home after a late shift. Promised language bonus was not delivered without a huge fight.\r\n\r\nI would advise any foreigner to avoid. I decided to apply for another job and got accepted instantly due to my language skill. I am now earning 1750 PLN more each month, work with a really nice team in a company with an excellent culture. Also our target is 30 resolutions a week, which is much more easier and the chats are shorter than Revolut ones.\r\n\r\nSo I say all of the negative press is 100% true, read the reviews here and do not work for this company unless you are a Pole or Ukrainian.

People see customer service employees as if they were less important and that is not fair. The environment is toxic and there is no career path for this. This is exhausting, to be honest. There is no balance between the quality of work and life. I once spoke to my team leader who treated me in a really bad way even screaming at me and a couple of weeks later apologized by saying that she was under a lot of pressure. There are some team leaders who are super arrogant and treat other people as if they were nothing. I have experienced this. Sometimes you message them and they do not even reply to you. I have never had constructive feedback or critics but they are always destructive. Someone should encourage you to get better not to bring you down.

You will work on projects that impact millions of customers. The product is a great product.", "cons": "Each team has progress check ins with the CEO each week. You have a very short period of time to convince the CEO that your idea and designs are the best solution. Most of the time, he already has a solution in mind and if your solution does not match with his exactly, you will be publicly called an \"idiot\" or \"stupid\" and he will threaten to replace you with \"someone who can do this right\" without explaining what you did wrong. The CEO does not have time to fully understand the problem and yet he makes every decision for you, down to button colours in your design. This results in suboptimal decision making and then teams release features that customers do not like or use.\r\n\r\nThere is no customer problem focused decision making. Every decision is made based on how much money we can make as a company. Testing and customer research is actively discouraged and if you run an experiment such as an A/B test, you will be considered \u201cstupid\u201d for not being able to use your own brain to determine the optimal outcome. There is no testing to measure the result of each decision made so it is assumed that each decision made by the CEO was successful.\r\n\r\nProduct leaders in the company do not have adequate product and leadership experience at other companies prior to joining Revolut. They are promoted from within for being loyal and staying at the company for years. The result is that the product leaders do not know how to create company level roadmaps and do not know how to properly prioritise projects and resources. Each team is only aware of their own priorities and only have a limited idea for how it compares to the company goals. Product owners with limited or no product experience have no one to learn from and cannot grow their skills, especially with consistent crazy deadlines to hit. \r\n\r\nSince there are no clear company roadmap and goals, priorities change on a weekly basis. Your own impactful ideas get moved down the backlog and you consistently have 5-10 people asking for different things from you. The \"get it done\" culture expects you to complete everything immediately. This is obviously impossible. The result is that you prioritise the tasks that belong to people who chase you the most. Other people expect you to drop everything you are working on to work on their problem. If you do not prioritise it, they will include you in slack messages with a senior leader from their team who does not understand your other priorities and will force you to complete their specific task. The chase culture here is intense. It is impossible to actually prioritise the most impactful items your team can work on. Every team becomes an execution team and no one has time or opportunity to come up with their own ideas.\r\n\r\nMost people here believe in the product and want Revolut to succeed. The unfortunate reality is that the constant priority shifting, lack of product thinking and threats to replace everyone demoralises all the employees. Most people are not motivated to their best work and people are quitting every week. I understand the frustration that the CEO must be feeling. He expects each team to come up with creative ideas and innovate but each team is so busy with hitting their KPIs that they do not have time to think and do customer research. There are no leaders who are pushing for change since we have realised that questioning the CEO's decisions is not worth losing your job over. As a result, the CEO does not see innovative work from the teams and thinks they are not capable. The team then gets replaced and the whole cycle starts over again."}, {"review_title": "Innovating company but complete wrong management", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Apr 2020", "job_title": "Recruiter in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I joined Revolut when the company had roughly 700 people at this time they were hiring recruiters like crazy! The hyper-growth phase is ultimately was attracted me and many others to the role. When I joined Revolut it saw me move from agency recruitment into internal recruitment for the first time, as it did pretty much with the entire recruitment team (which was 100+ plus). Here is my honest review: \r\n\r\n+ The company are extremely ambitious and they wont let anything to stop them from achieving the set goals (though this can also be seen as a negative, see below)\r\n\r\n+ Truly revolutionary product which constantly adds new features. \r\n\r\n+ You will never be bored or have a lack of work, something is always needed to be done\r\n\r\n+ They give some of the best perks in the market\r\n\r\n+ Fully set up with everything you need as a recruiter. As well as this you will be set up with pretty much any tech equipment you need (though be warned if you dont return anything when you leave you will be invoiced, something they dont tell you at the start)\r\n\r\n+ They have some great people and certain departments have a great culture \r\n\r\n+ Good fun company events and regular hosted events in the HQ\r\n\r\n+ Great company to have on your CV", "cons": "Now for the downside to working for Revolut. I value my experience here as invaluable but a LOT needs to be changed in order for the business to become a global bank. \r\n\r\n- The business is always first NEVER the people \r\n\r\n- No clear career progression. If this is your first inhouse recruitment experience you will pretty much be used a resourcer \r\n\r\n- You'll be given tight deadlines to hire people but it seems nobody ever wants to interview the candidates. This results in employees not turning up to interviews (believe me it happens a lot), interview cancellations last minute and at the worst they will decide they dont want to interview the candidate anymore when they are due to interview the candidate in 5 minutes! \r\n\r\n- Be prepared for certain department to ignore you point blank for days on end even with urgent matters. \r\n\r\n- Be prepared to work long hours. This isnt a 9 to 5 job, you will find yourself working in the office until all hours to achieve your KPIs \r\n\r\n- KPIs are a MUST . If you underperform in one month then it could be the end of your employment \r\n\r\n- The business have pretty much hired with short term vision and not long term vision in mind. \r\n\r\n- The company leaders lack the right management experience. In each area of the business you will have people that are only leading due to having joined the business in the early days. Just because someone has been in the company longest does NOT mean they should be managing or leading.
