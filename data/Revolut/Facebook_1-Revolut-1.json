Very political, super hierarchical. It is not a startup, but huge corporate machine. \r\n- There were few comments below about favoritism, it is true \r\n- if you are a friend of CEO/SVP Revenue/Head of Legal \r\n- you have a chance in this company. If god forbid you tell those guys truth in their face - you can just leave the next day, your life in Revolut will be miserable. \r\n- Revolut is a company of one man, and nobody inside are able to stand up against CEO's opinion or decisions even though when everybody in the room understand he tells BS. \r\n- Culture is a fear driven, people are scared to be fired, and in the most recent environment and lack of job options elsewhere that results in the fact that most folks just conform with the stupidity and nonsense that is going on inside. \r\n\r\nCOMPANY \r\nYou may hear a lot from recruitment teams and hiring managers, but just know one thing - they lie. They are desperate to hit their recruitment KPIs which they are measured on, hence they have full incentive to tell you whatsoever, to make sure you sign the contract. Keeping you in the company is a problem and KPI of HR team, hence Recruitment dont care. \r\n\r\nPeople development is not a company priority, really. Most probably, L&D person will respond to my review and explain everything is different - but trust me, no one cares about your growth in this company. \r\nThis is what you will get in Revolut: \r\n- Nobody cares about your development \r\n- Nobody cares about your wellbeing \r\n- Nobody cares about your health (especially mental because it will be brought to extreme edge) \r\n- Nobody cares about you. \r\n\r\nYou are just a resource for CEO/Revolut to get from point A to point B. Once you hit your own limit (and you will, in many cases not because of your professional limitations but due to unreasonable targets that are being increased every 3 months without and proper logic behind it), you will be considered as redundant and get fired. \r\n\r\n- People are being fired in 1 day. On all levels. You met with your manager yesterday, discussed long term plans and how you will organise the work in the next 2-3 months, and the next thing you know, her/his account is deactivated next morning and unless you exchange phone numbers, you will never hear from this person ever again.\r\n\r\nFUNCTION \r\n- Reading articles on Wired, you may have noticed departure of 2 CFO, 1 deputy CFO and 1 Head of Finance over 1.5 years. Churn in Finance leadership is worse than in customer support organisation. \r\n\r\n- As a result, finance function is one big problem in Revolut, company doesn't even know how much cash they are burning every month. Instead of relying on accounting function and proper reporting tools, in a typical for Revolut manner they diverted group of developers to build another in-house half-baked solution to prepare financial results for the company which are being considered as 100% correct. \r\n\r\n- Accounting team is severely understaffed. My team mates were suffocating with the amount of work load and information to process, working for 14-16 hours a day and in the end either fired or considered as underperforming. I heard CEO saying at the finance function-wide meeting: \"You are just an accountant\". This is the attitude you are going to get if you hold ACCA, multi-years in Big4 and join this company. \r\n\r\nI feel I didnt express enough but I hope this should warn some bright people and prevent them from joining this filthy institution. While I have met some fo the smartest people in the world here, I warn future stars to not choose to work in Revolut. \r\n\r\nI think only this kind of market boycott will make the leadership think about how much they value employees as humans and not human resources."}, {"review_title": "Toxic Culture", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Marketing in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": ".

You need to understand this and count this in when making any decision. Most of the cons and pros described below are coming from fast growth. Because of growth an rapid changes, my review probably should be considered outdated within a year.\r\n\r\nSecond of all, most of the people in the company are incredibly motivated, passionate, smart, polite and pleasant to work with, but relatively young and inexperienced. This is slowly changing as the company matures.\r\n\r\nThird of all, there is indeed very small amount of processes and bureaucracy in the company, which is again is great and frustrating at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhat I consider the main pros here:\r\n- Revolut has a unique and addictive spirit of freedom, being part of something world-changing and understanding of your personal mission within the company. There are many things you can take over and improve. You also have full freedom to act smart and design something in the best way. Often you will have to create something that was never done before ever (this is partially why being smart is sometimes more valued than being experienced here). No one will stop you - there are more things to do then people. If you will demonstrate the ability to improve things, you will be given all resources to grow. \r\n- Exposure to business. Everything is transparent here, and you get to know a lot of people and understand their daily job. Very good for understanding how a growing startup works and a must if you are thinking of making a company in the future.\r\n- Multiple office locations. Sometimes mentioned in the cons, but I like this feeling of globality. Working remotely is not discouraged - after all, Revolut is made for travelers.\r\n- Colleagues. They are nice and smart. I don't notice competitiveness.", "cons": "- Long working hours are often mentioned here among the cons. Even though if no one is forcing you to stay after 6 pm, people indeed often end up working late. There are two main reasons for this: 1) many things are disrupted by growth and are disorganized and 2) working is addictive when it is causing a big impact. Working long hours is respected and valued and is not expected by default. Same relates to working at weekends.\r\n- Rudeness and ignorance. This is entirely not true for the majority of the company, especially engineering. There are some teams with the aggressive and provocative culture which is a must in their daily job, but logical reasoning and common sense are respected and valued universally on all levels. Also, do not confuse rudeness with trader mentality.\r\n- Chaos and frustration. This is somehow true and I believe the reason is rapid growth. The code base is very solid and reliable though. TDD is a must. Generally speaking, things have improved massively over the last years and are on the right path.\r\n- benefits. Compared to Facebook, Google, etc, they are indeed very insignificant. Same with salaries - they are not low, but some companies offer more. Yet still, we have applicants from those companies.\r\n\r\nI would not advise you working for Revolut if you find it easier to work with a pre-defined set of responsibilities. You will be frequently getting out of your comfort zone and doing things you never did before. It is also possible you might burn out - work is addictive and no one will stop you, but neither you will be pushed.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, you have to choose between chaotic but exciting and boring, but established.

I thought this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Now I really hope it is, because I never want to have an experience like this again.\r\n\r\nThere is no training provided here. You get a one week company induction, not related to your role and that's it. You are then expected to start working immediately.\r\n\r\nI had to learn most processes and workflows by myself because most of my probation period was spent working from home during lock down. I improved my own quality score to 100%, which I thought was great, but no. The company does not care about the quality of your work, only quantity. I thought this was fine, as I was clearly overachieving the productivity target anyway.\r\n\r\n2 weeks before the end of my probation, management completely changed our KPIs. This wasn't just a slight tweak, it was a huge overhaul. They changed what counted as productivity without understanding the daily work of the department. This meant I had to relearn how to do the job in order to achieve this ridiculous new target. I wasn't alone, 3/4 of the team could not achieve the new target. despite the challenge, I more than doubled my score, but it wasn't enough. I was released at the end of my probation due to \"under performance\" I don't understand how they could have come to that decision, with all the hard work and dedication I put in prior. I was told \"Sorry, it's the end of your probation and you're not at 100% of the target. Bye\" They waited until my last day to let me know.\r\n\r\nOur team had huge backlogs, with customers waiting 3+ days for assistance. I spent most of my last 2 weeks trying to clear this, but management didn't consider this to be \"productive\" as it didn't contribute to targets, despite customers still being team priority. Going above and beyond your line of duty is not valued or respected here.\r\n\r\nI was so incredibly naive to think that my contribution was valued\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I was left stranded in Poland for 2 months without any source of income. Revolut don't care...\r\n\r\nIt makes me feel so sick when I see Revolut posting about \"valuing\" employes on social media.\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n\r\n- Management does not care if you are good or bad at your job, they just care about quantity of work done.\r\n\r\n- Management do not offer any support or guidance to employees, until the day they want to fire them\r\n\r\n- Being a team player or going above and beyond in any situation is not valued, in fact, they don't care. They only care about productivity.\r\n\r\n- Management will completely change KPIs and expectations with no guidance and they will quickly fire you if you don't achieve them, even if you have to completely relearn how to work to achieve them.\r\n\r\n- Management don't even know about the work that they are setting KPIs for\r\n\r\n- Little to no training provided."}, {"review_title": "Fun place to work at!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Customer Service Specialist in Porto, Oporto", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome benefit pack\r\nExcellent teams with open-minded people\r\nMarvellous facilities", "cons": "Rotating shifts (expected as the company works 24/7)\r\nUnrealistic goals"}, {"review_title": "Not Applicaable", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Operations Analyst in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good to work at this company.", "cons": "No cons . good to work at this company"}, {"review_title": "Great to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Associate in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Smart motivated people across the company", "cons": "Pretty high turnover of people"}, {"review_title": "Better wait 2-3 years for this company to get organized.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Jan 2020", "job_title": "Customer Support in Krak\u00f3w", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Beautiful office\r\n- Smart, youthful, ambitious colleagues\r\n- Really good referral bonus.

I joined Revolut a few months ago and was excited to join a challenging environment. I recently resigned due to a combination of reasons, which is unusual because people are usually terminated here, they don't really get to resign.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n1) You will learn a lot. The learning curve is steep here from the moment you join. I think I had a couple hours introduction and the next day I was submerged in work. I learnt more in the first couple of weeks here than I did in previous jobs.\r\n\r\n2) You will not be bored. I have not come across anyone who just sat around with nothing to do. You are pretty much at full capacity most of the time.\r\n\r\n3) Free healthy snacks. Cheeky perk, but it they have free breakfast, drinks, snacks etc.\r\n\r\n4) Free Deliveroo after 7pm (\u00a315 including delivery cost)\r\n\r\n5) Intelligent people below middle management. I worked predominantly with data people and they were some of the most competent and smart people I have worked with.\r\n\r\n6) The results of your effort are seen. Revolut is output focused, What is good is that they implement a way for you to see how your individual KPI impacts different levels of the company. i.e. Team KPI, Department KPI, Company KPI.", "cons": "To be honest, I actually left because I ended up having mental health problems because of working at Revolut, to the point where I suffered from daily panic attacks and breathing problems, and ended up in hospital. I found that while working there I became more toxic and angry. Even my partner had noticed I was always stressed and severely unhappy. However, I'll try to be fair with the cons and provide explanation.\r\n\r\nIf you want to skip all the details I summarised the 7 points right at the bottom.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n\r\n1) No work-life balance. You will work minimum 9-12 hours a day - I sometimes was in office till midnight or later. That's why they offer the perk of free UBER trips from the office to your house if you are in office past midnight. The perk is there for a reason. I'm not saying this is an objectively bad thing. Some people like this kind of lifestyle and that is fine, for me it wasn't great. In my opinion, this isn't a place you would want to work at if you want to maintain a life outside of work. Again, this is debatable depending on what you want out of life.\r\n\r\n2) The culture is very toxic. Management (middle, senior, execs) view people as resources and not people. They say they are changing, and they will probably reply to this review saying 'They are working on it...', but trust me when I say: this is not a priority for the company. They are output driven, which means they don't care how the results are produced, as long as they are produced; even if that means working 15 hours a day, everyday. \r\n\r\nWhen I was joining, I was assured that they are working on improving their culture and focusing on employees. This was not true, at all. Essentially, they just implemented a room with curtains that you can pull shut, where you could go if you were stressed to relax a bit. But here's the catch - since deadlines don't move and everything is output driven, - the longer you stayed in that room, the longer you had to stay after hours just to meet the demanding deadlines. Bottom line: it wasn't much help and this was Revolut's only solution to mental health problems in the work place, even after the hundreds of review comments via internal surveys and platforms like Glassdoor telling management, that the current work place is not sustainable for most people.\r\n\r\nJust to summarise: you probably won't be seen as an individual unless you get to a level in management. BUT there are a small amount of teams which implement their own culture and phenomenal to work for... I just hope you get into one of these few teams, if not.... god bless you and good luck.\r\n\r\n3) Management are way too inexperienced - most of the managers there aren't people who have experience in their role, but are in exec positions because they were early employees. This leads to certain problems:\r\n\r\n - Young successful people in high positions are trying to prove that they deserve their exec levels, so they implement unreasonable targets and asks which people below have to run around and jump through hoops to meet.\r\n\r\n- Just pure inexperience and lack of leadership and direction - sometimes it honestly feels like they don't know what they are doing and then saying they need something 10 mins before a meeting. There have been instances where management have agreed to implement something by a deadline only to find that they don't even have data to complete the task because management didn't discuss anything with the data people and just guessed if they had information or not. Which again means that people below have to bend over backwards.\r\n\r\n- Just unprofessional - Its not uncommon for people to yell at each other there and management to get at each others throats because there is simply no communication between them (again: inexperience). Sometimes because of no experience management does not understand the weight of the words they write or say. They are senior managers and a lot of people look up them. They can be often inappropriate, and since they are young, they don't quite grasp that some of things they say can cause serious problems... I get that they are a start-up but if you want to be a bank (or just a respectable company), you should probably act with some more professionalism.\r\n\r\nAgain to summarise - young inexperienced people are in really high places here.\r\n\r\n\r\n4) The concept of 'A-Players'. Revolut is obsessed with this term. Essentially they only want the best of the best to work for them. Don't misunderstand: they do not want to train and develop their employees to become A-players and grow. NOPE. They want people to be A-players right when they join. Whats-more, is that this terms has created a divide in the company into the 'GREATS' and the 'COMMONERS'. The greats being the A-players (people who have outstanding performance reviews and are only a small fraction of people in the company). The Peasants being the other 80% or so of the company. This divide is a serious psychological problem where you have to be in the ELITE group otherwise you are worthless in the company. It's so bad that it has come to the point that your feedback on internal surveys to improve Revolut doesn't carry much weight in the company unless you are one of these 'A-Players'. Its like a sad school drama show...\r\n\r\n\r\n5) The general attitude of the company is 'We are amazing and you should be grateful to work for us'... This isn't a bad thing to some degree, it's good that they are proud of themselves, but I think it is blown way out of proportion. From the moment you apply to Revolut the attitude is on the arrogant side - they believe that they only deserve the best of the best - but what they do not understand is that an 'A-player' wants to work in an 'A-Class' company like Google, Microsoft or the other Tech Titans. It's evident from the company reviews and ratings on this platform and many others that the company is not at the level that they can demand just the A-players from around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n6) The compensation is good compared to the market (not by much). What you need to understand is that Revolut is in a league of its own: if you compare the amount of hours you work to the pay they give you, you will understand that you are actually being underpaid.\r\n\r\nFor example if you work at 2 companies ABC, XYZ.\r\n\r\nABC pay you \u00a31000 a week but you work 45 hours a week (standard contract)\r\n\r\nXYZ pay you \u00a31200 a week but you work 60 hours a week (12 hours a day and pay a bit better than market)\r\n\r\nABC are paying you \u00a322.22 an hour while XYZ are paying you \u00a320 an hours.\r\n\r\nOf course it is not always like this, but before you think that they are paying you more than your previous job, weigh up the pay in comparison to the extra level of work you will be doing (not to mention emotional abuse and potential mental health repercussions).\r\n\r\n\r\n7) Line managers are quite poor here. Not everyone, but a lot of them are not qualified to be line managers. In my experience, they offer no support, and are very quick to blame you. My manager didn't even know what my career progression goals were, I was just a expendable resource to them. They are usually too busy for you, which they tend use as an excuse for not performing their line managing duties and proceed to blame you that you didn't 'manage upward enough' which is just another way of them getting out of their line managing duties. Even when you request a new line manager they refuse to let you go and change, because I guess it looks bad on them, so you end up stuck with a line manager that doesn't pay much attention to your growth. \r\n\r\nMy worst experience was when another team wanted me to work for them and I wanted to work for that team, only to be blocked by my current line manager telling me I can't go. Later I was in a meeting with other managers and my line manager, when my manager said:\r\n\"Some managers are bad, line managers shouldn't block someone's internal move to a team they are more suited to because people leave and then apply externally\".\r\n\r\nI just sat in that meeting honestly really upset about the situation since the same manager blocked my internal move and then made themselves seem like a thoughtful leader coming up with this solution, when in reality they were doing the exact thing they were preaching against. That was the final moment before I decided I can no longer work there. That and the series of panic attacks I had while working there, I could name other terrible things that happened but I think this review is long enough... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SUMMARISE\r\n\r\n\r\n1) NO WORK-LIFE BALANCE\r\n2) CULTURE IS TOXIC\r\n3) MANAGEMENT IS YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED\r\n4) CONCEPT OF A-PLAYERS CREATES A CLASS SYSTEM IN THE COMPANY\r\n5) REVOLUT HAS A PRETENTIOUS ATTITUDE\r\n6) PAY IS NOT GOOD WHEN PUT IN PERSPECTIVE WITH THE HOURS WORKED\r\n7) LINE MANAGERS CAN HONESTLY BREAK YOUR EXPERIENCE THERE AND BREAK YOU"}, {"review_title": "Senior Backend Developer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Senior Backend Developer in Moscow, Moskva", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Good salary compensations, benefits and options (I can say above market)\r\n- No bureaucracy (I  mean at all)\r\n- Very flexible schedule (U can agree most things of working time with product owner and team)\r\n- There is quite interesting scope of tasks, despite the fact this is fin-tech startup\r\n- Working with experienced, result oriented team where your decisions matter", "cons": "- Sometimes working on weekends\r\n- Sometimes goals and bonuses not clear setted\r\n- There also many routine tech tasks that u should do (Just my personal opinion)\r\n- Difficult to start if u are newcomer (there is no any written standarts, u learn them through existing code, lack of guidance)"}, {"review_title": "Great opportunities to grow and do ground-breaking work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Legal Counsel in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you're thinking of applying to Revolut, you should try to chat with a few people who work here now and not listen too much to the noise in the press based on a few disgruntled ex-employees.

As the time wears on, some of people whose work's quality was questionable are given pleasant, well-paid tenures for no apparent reason other than that they've just stayed for long enough.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is nothing frown upon at Revolut to be promoted to a new role (having won a tough recruitment) only to see that one's been given an effectively smaller net salary, since the entry roles entail extra pay chances which are closed afterwards as one advances. Needless to say how it may play with one's motivation.\r\n\r\nThe feedback path is deficient when it comes to people perched a step higher up the ladder. It is factually impossible to have an influence against somebody over you in the hierarchy, should you see that person not living up to their duties.\r\n\r\nThere's a feeling of disregard to the level of stress a typical consumer-facing employee is exposed to each day. What is more, instead of soothing the impact, there comes a second, tough stress blow from the line managers focused on the KPIs. One may imagine that although stress is natural and can be beneficial, it can't be cranked up endlessly as straining it doesn't go on par with better results or higher discipline.\r\n\r\nLastly, an unpleasant surprise that one would rather avoid witnessing is the one whereby the in-house recruitment process sees some staffers outpowering the tough competition and being promoted to the new roles, for them only to be told on the eve of being introduced to the new position that their new contracts had been scrapped due to changing objectives. Regardless of the legitimacy of such turbulent decisions (which may be well justified and which I don't dispute) being tossed to and fro in such an aloof fashion is incredibly burdensome to the psyche.

Never work here, you will have only regrets and stress. Company and founders don't understand product, technology and good culture at all. \r\n\r\nYou won't be doing product. It's digital transformation company:\r\n- 100% top-down company, all design, roadmap, etc. decisions are made by Nikolay Storonsky. You will be only in charge of execution/project management. He is reviewing every new screen and epic every week with every team (Revolut has 50+ teams). All middle managers are just proxies, no decisions, no their own opinions and easily blow you in back. \r\n- Not product way of thinking at all, in a year I haven't seen any team made user research and A/B test. All development is done in an absolutely blind way, guided by the supervision of Nikolay. Moreover, all these instruments are prohibited and replace with \"thinking deeper\" value that means just sit and think a lot. Nikolay personally hates these methods and several times told me that it's for idiots.\r\n- The short-sighted, company mostly focused on small improvements that can be done in 1-2 week otherwise it's too much risk and should be cancelled. \r\n- Every two weeks you will have a review with your functional manager who will be checking Jira epics and Figmas to verify that you have enough words there, structure, etc. (no one really cares for product stuff) \r\n- Did you say strategy? These guys don't have any understanding of their client, such as personas, segments, key pain points, etc.\r\n- Never ever question Nik's opinions and decisions! He is always right, otherwise, you are fired immediately. Stronger together!!!\r\n\r\nThat's super sad because there are so many good and shiny managers fooled and hired from cool companies that struggling with topics above and leaving. During interviews, people and recruiters will tell you and even test you on the product skills above but it will last time you will ever use it. \r\n\r\nFrom technology and quality perspective company is messy as well:\r\n- There are no QA engineers and that's could be ok if you have autotests but Revolut mostly doesn't have it. They do have it only for backend and no one care for web and apps. All QA work is on PO shoulders. Yes yes yes, you will be doing here QA and project management but not product work. And as you can imagine PO doesn't have time and nobody QA it at all.\r\n- CTO, Vlad is really obsessed about reviews, reports and can't handle any feedback, the same as Nikolay. Every two weeks you would be measured against 10-15 parameters (most of them are really stupid) and you can't question any decision and situation (such people usually immediately fired). All of this lead to fear of punishment, making mistake - developers producing a lot of small crappy improvements to minimise their risk.\r\n- Most of the codebase written in rush by students, so it's really buggy and re-inventing existing technologies and frameworks messily. As you can understand, it isn't a modern stack and very hard learning curve.\r\n\r\nBased on the information above it's pretty clear that you won't be trusted and company culture is very toxic. They call it A-players or champions. We should hire and retain only them. In practice, Revolut fires everyone who is average or below it - you should be excellent. Last mid review we were told that we doing just feedback sessions. All this information was used to fire people immediately, even with average feedback. \r\n\r\nMost of the senior managers are just kids, doing that they were told.

That results in a massive technical debt and huge security gaps that no-one is trying to resolve.\r\nMost engineers are constantly creating new systems under the immense pressure of tight KPIs. These KPIs are now for every quarter, and failure to perform will always be seen as an individual's fault and never as a structural problem. People are under the constant fear of getting fired, or in the best case just stressed and overworked.\r\n\r\nTechnical recruitment has been made under the terrible assumption that any programmer knows or can learn system design or infrastructure. In reality, only a handful of people are taking care of it, so they spend all their time firefighting instead of improving things, which in turn results to a big turnover.\r\n\r\nThe CTO does not seem to be cut out for the job. He micro-manages individual projects, but completely ignores vast parts of engineering. He takes decisions alone, does not listen, and will never change his mind once set. He will not acknowledge things he does not understand. He is arrogant and patronizing.\r\n\r\nThere is no middle management: just team leads and senior figures. Because of that teams have no coordination, sometimes doing the same work twice or heading into completely different directions, or having mismatched expectations from each other.\r\n\r\nDevelopers don't have the right tools to work with. For instance, the company uses bitbucket and teamcity, which are a daily waste of time because of lack of features and frequent outages. Everyone frequently complains about it, but the issue hasn't even been acknowledged by senior management.\r\n\r\nEven though someone is in charge of inclusion and diversity, and they claim to be against harassment and bullying, it's just for show.

If you want to work like a human being, not a robot, the target is quite unachievable. If you ask the person who set the target to do the exact same thing as the Support Agents should do, for sure they cannot handle it.\r\n\r\nNo time to be up to date. For example, when you have days off for two days in a week, you miss a lot of information, when you get back to work, you must be ready for all the changes and news. So they are expecting you to be updated even if it\u2019s taking your free/leisure/unpaid time to read it. Please keep in mind that the CS Specialist is the lowest position, with the lowest salary, and still they expect people to spend extra time for them. \r\n\r\nChaotic, messy internal information/procedure. When there is a product launch/issue, quite often no one knows what is really happening. Even their knowledge base is quite confusing/messy, not all information is covered. \r\n\r\nThey don\u2019t care if you go the extra mile to investigate the cases thoroughly. Again, most of the time they do not have a procedure settled for something, so you need to create a totally brand new procedure, but it requires a big effort and time. Another thing is when a case is quite complicated, it is taking your time, you want to do your best to solve it, but you are also stressed out cause then you will not meet your target. \r\n\r\nThey don\u2019t care about the quality of your work, they\u2019d rather appreciate careless employees as long as the numbers are high. If you are a diligent person who takes things into consideration, you want to give the best of your work, then avoid this company, they don\u2019t deserve your effort. \r\n\r\nRegarding the way they treat the daily target, basically their logic is like this: Let\u2019s make a tree-climbing competition. The participants would be a monkey and a dolphin. When the dolphin loses, they said to him/her: Well\u2026 Monkey could win, so why are you not able to win? We have done a fair competition here. \r\n\r\nTeam Leaders are not leaders. They are just calculating your performance.weekly. They don\u2019t know how to manage people, they are there to press the staff. Also, their work is not transparent to everybody so no one knows what they exactly do. Most of them don\u2019t even know the product, yet you must consult with them for some decisions, no wonder when you ask them to take a decision, they are mostly scared to take action. Of course, not all of them are bad, but there are only a few good Team Leaders. \r\n\r\nThey always think about money and profit so they want you to be an expert on anything. It is expensive to hire an expert or specialist in its field. There is a topic where they expect you to know everything about that in one hour. Yes you are given the time to read for maximum one hour, and you are already the \u201cspecialist\u201d for it. While if you go to finance major in university, it probably could take one semester the minimum, They don\u2019t want to give you more time for it. But again, why pay more when you could pay less. Time is money. \r\n\r\nThey fired you without warning. And in the meeting they just deactivated your Slack account so you cannot contact anyone else in the company, they gave a limited time to choose which option of the contract. No time to consult with a lawyer, it is a total bully, someone should not be pressed like that, in fact they should have time to think.
