I worked 14 hour days during the pandemic like all my colleagues but it\u2019s all forgotten and without providing rationale or data to support the arguement on return to work, everyone\u2019s mandated 3 days working from the office without advance warning. Did People operations do studies or collect data on what\u2019s best for us before forcing this on us? Did they check productivity before forcibly mandating with no transparency a sudden return to 3 day office work? Worse is how Traveloka is using a big brother approach to \u201csee\u201d who badges in, when, which entry points, & then sends warning letters copying the Manager for not fulfilling 3 days at the office. Why is that necessary? Employees feel so uneasy because we are being watched to the point of feeling paranoid. No regard for mental health either or feedback sessions with People Ops. They go on snooze mode by 5 pm on Slack with no consideration for employees. It\u2019s 2022 but they aren\u2019t embracing the future of work. There is no point securing investments and always sharing nice news and wins about growth and other good opportunities when people operations didn\u2019t even do a survey or ask feedback from employees before forcing, with a stick approach, mandatory 3 day return to office. No regard for working parents either, no flexibility, just strict orders and if you disobey, you\u2019ll be warned with a black mark on your HR file. If they want attrition, they are getting it and people ops is not concerned about retaining talent. They don\u2019t as of today even know the core drivers of employee engagement. Not once in 3 years here have I seen People ops address employee pain points.
