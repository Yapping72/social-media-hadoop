My team and other teams were re-assigned but we had little training and were given few tasks to do; it would take several months to actually get features - fairly small in anyone's definition - shipped. New projects would be planned and talent would not be assigned. It was a huge waste of resources. Meanwhile, our competitors were soldiering ahead.

Not everyone is a team player, and even though the company pushes for \"bridges not silos\", some people are only Take and Take. God help us if they reach Lead/Management levels. Salary is not as high as it should b e for a Dublin role. No cash incentive to set up home office throughout COVID pandemic. Office chairs/old monitors were offered, but these are still company property and once people returned to office, these had to be returned. Internal bonus cash incentives have been massively trimmed/negated. So don't be expecting thanks for going above and beyond for anyone else (not that \"keeping count\" is healthy anyways), it was nice having upwards of a thousand in cash to spend come Christmas for all the extra time put into helping colleagues outside of normal work endeavours. The huge change in leadership and exec rosters in the past 5 years have left many demoralised. And we have never quite recovered after Bill left (TBH).

(e.g. everyone in Ireland) - If you have work ethic, take pride in your work, and love customer service, it begins to get a little frustrating when you see institutionalized fulltimers that don't pull their weight but get paid practically the same amount as you, even though you're working 2x as hard 2x longer. HR doesn't have the guts to cut off the dead weight once they're part of the system so you're stuck with them. - It's essentially run like an American tech company, a very deliberate revolving door sophisticated attrition system in order to keep average salaries low and avoid employees working their until retirement. It works and it isn't going to change. - Salary bumps are minute and don't reflect inflationary pressures, fiscally translating into a pay cut year on year sometimes (as annual inflation is greater than salary increases) - In my experience, the vast majority of SAP clients had a particular disdain for SAP products and services but felt grandfathered in to using them. You'll spend a lot of time commiserating with them and finding creative ways to make them feel better about the slop they believe they're eating.

Time off is negatively affected by high demands, learning advancement hard to get as it is linked to manager\u2019s budget / performance, and the rest is similar to other tech companies. 3) Management / company structure \u2013 different in various parts, however, overall highly hierarchical and focused on German top management. Company rewards qualities that in many cases lead to promoting \u201cbad\u201d managers. Leadership and vision are negatively affected as many in top positions left the company. The current top management is just supervising the operation. 4) Job security \u2013 relatively low if you are outside of EU. German / European employees are unionized and protected by EU law, so any workforce changes only affect those outside of EU. Layoffs often happen behind the scenes. 5) Products / innovation - SAP used to innovate internally, however, for some time the focus has been on just acquiring. The acquisitions had a varying level of success, yet almost none went well. The result is a suite of disjoined products requiring ongoing fixes, corrections and many time re-architecting. Switch to the subscription model shifted the burden of those issues to SAP employees. 6) People - the company has been steadily losing top talent / performers. 6) Other \u2013 financials are heavily influenced by outside investors.
