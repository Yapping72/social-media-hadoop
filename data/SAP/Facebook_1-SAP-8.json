SAP does not do any exit interviews and all the leaving employees are required to complete is one online survey question with a multiple choice response as to why they are leaving. \r\nPeople are recognized for the wrong behavior and are promoted for equally inappropriate reasons.

The team is full of senile technocrats, as reluctant as the dogmatics (they think they are certain that they are right and that everyone else is wrong). The entire downstream leadership can be tagged to the pool of adjectives like visionless, selfishness etc.. An analogy for the choice of the leaders here can be something like - a fish is sitting on a tree and a landlubber is swimming in the sea. Each leader has his own unique spanning tree - restricted to their clan. Like medieval age, each faction is fighting for the driver\u2019s seat. The recent re-org has put the team into a Brownian motion. The past year has been the least productive except the leader\u2019s enhancing their belly size but all know that - fish die belly upward, and rise to the surface. Its their way of falling. The team is moving towards an irremediable state - it\u2019s on the verge of becoming an NP-hard problem. The excellent SAP opportunities are being taken down the drain by the incompetent and visionless downstream superiors. ARIBA\u2019s leadership and their quintessential ideas are being squandered by a handful of senile, self-obsessed local leaders.
