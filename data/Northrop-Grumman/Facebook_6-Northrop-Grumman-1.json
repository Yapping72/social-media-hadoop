Employees who can do their work in a sufficient manner working remotely were required to come into work 5 days a week on my direct team. Most of our work is done using computers sitting in cubicles, yet there was zero flexibility despite senior leadership saying so.

Excessive back-and-forth just to relay the status of work or to confirm a problem. The actual people with technical knowledge are treated extremely poorly.
