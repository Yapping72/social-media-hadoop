There are few young people. Of course, this can be an advantage, depending on your perspective (since a large poriton of the workforce will be retiring within the next 10 years). However, the company needs to compensate for this. They should encourage get togethers for younger employees, plan activities for them, or somehow find a way to live up to the fun and creativity of companies like Google and Yahoo. They need to give young employees praise and positive feedback consistently. The work we do is very difficult, and we are doing it amongst people that know how to do it with their eyes closed, as many have been here for years and years. Management should NOT expect us to pick things up right away and should encourage us to learn and treat us with respect. Perks for new employees would be great. I cant think of many. Most perks are given to senior employees.\r\n\r\nIf you dont show your appreciation for young employees, then we will leave the company.

The company will never evolve. \r\n\r\nAnother downside are the traditional ways of the company. Meetings are long and inefficient. Trainings are awfully boring, far too long, and consist of lectures instead of direct involvement and learning through practice. And wait until you try to state your opinion about it to a coworker or a manager. They will likely just shrug their shoulders and stay away from any new ideas or act like they dont know what you are talking about.  Their idea of training new employees is to either throw them into random training classes that are a complete waste of time, ask them to learn through books, or throwing information at them. People aren't really willing to take the time to sit down and explain things to you if you dont understand something - they either act annoyed or are too busy, or they just don't want to \"overwhelm\" you with critical knowledge that you need. \r\n\r\nI realize that its not like this at every single Northrop Grumman, but this is definitely the case where I work."}, {"review_title": "Overall it is ok, but conditions and educational benefits can be better", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary is one the best in industry from what we can tell in this particular job market and current economy.", "cons": "Employee education and benefits need more attention.

Many of these suppliers are now looking for other markets, simply fed up with the US Navy's attitude and approach to fostering sustainable private business.\r\n\r\nThe US Navy has nobody to blame but themselves for decimating what used to be a thriving private sector business.  Ships are more expensive, yes, but a lot of the reason is requirements driven and the US Govt workers and their beltway bandit buddies (including the Navy Laboratory Mafia) acting as overpaid \"oversight\" parasites and adding little real value in return.\r\n\r\nIt should amaze most people to know the the US Govt/Navy passes muster over the merit pay increases for Northrop Grumman Shipbulding employees, a publicly traded company.

I had to do their job for them and get every piece of information they needed to complete the background check. How hard is it to go to Google and look up the HR number for my previous employers? I should have known it was bad omen. They kept me in the dark about my start date until day before. HR did such a bad job, I didn't have a desk, phone, or computer assigned to me for almost a month!\r\n\r\nThe Northrop Grumman program leadership is more incompetent about doing their job than the HR department. Their heads are stuck in the 60's so they have no clue about how to write good software. Good coding practices, such as design patterns and abstraction, are not only looked down upon, but the people trying to fix the code are yelled at. They are forced to write absolutely unmaintainable code. Highly nested 3,000+ functions are commonplace. Fixing a bug with that kind structure usually breaks 18 other things. The program leadership also looks down upon using tools because in the 60's everyone used Vi or Emacs. Those programs are great for editing files once in a while, but tools are made for a reason: they make programmers more productive and problems can be debugged faster. No wonder most of their projects are over budget and 5 years behind schedule.\r\n\r\nThe corporate leadership is worse than the program leadership because they tolerate the program leadership's abusive behavior. The people doing the real work are typically yelled at for doing exactly what the program leadership tells them to do. I'm sure the corporate leadership notices trends with employees quitting due to abusive leads, yet the corporate leadership does nothing. They allow the program leads to continue abusing the employees and lead their programs into a shark infested waters.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman's work friction does not end with the leadership; there are many road blocks to actually trying to do a good job. The IT department blocks all useful internet content. This is understandable for most companies since they don't want their employees chatting with their Facebook buddies the whole day, but Northrop's IT department is so strict it interferes with work. They block Subversion, CVS, Git, or any configuration management protocol so developers can't look at good code examples. Many development blogs that post solutions to for common problems are completely blocked. Software Engineers are not given administrative rights to their computers so they cannot install the necessary development tools to get the job done. Developers have to put in requests to get anything useful installed, but there is so much red tape within the company that it takes months to get the tools needed to do a good job.\r\n\r\nWith all the bad leadership and pains to get work done, at least the office environment and corporate perks make up for it, right? Northrop didn't get that right either. Employee morale is an absolute afterthought. There are no basics. Water coolers are not provided. Employees have the option of paying $5.00 a month to join a water club when a water cooler should have been provided for free. Horrible Foldgers cofffee is also offered for $0.25 a cup. The El Segundo site is also so old, sometimes saw dead cockroaches are visible in the hallways.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend Northrop Grumman to any software developer. You will throw your skill set away and deal with unnecessary stress. If you're going to do that, you might as well work at coffee shop for minimum wage because at least you'll have a good time interacting with nice people."}, {"review_title": "OK place to work for those who just follow orders", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Mar 2011", "job_title": "Windows Server Administrative in Woodland Hills, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good at providing flexibility for sometimes working from home.

I've personally seen the old processes and sub-par technologies this company develops. It is so far from cutting edge. They speak of Agile and Cloud as if they are the new tomorrow. Agile is 20th century, and Cloud was decades ago. These are not new concepts. But the company narrative is that they are leading the way with these buzzwords.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the logo, I thought, B2 bomber. But now that I think about it some more, it more accurately reflects a revenue graph. Investors, watch out for the suddenly drop.\r\n\r\nContracts:\r\nI've personally been involved programs where the company lost several hundred millions of dollars to these long-term contracts10 years+. When the company wins a large contract, they shift the workforce to retain quality employees that would be otherwise be RIF'ed from these other programs. The company's narrative is we value our employees and will ensure they have jobs when the contract ends. What they don't say is that they only keep ones that have managerial status or seniority.\r\n\r\nLet's be honest, the company is arrogant. They are living off the successes of the past and failed to be competitive for the future. If you value yours, get the experience you need and get out.\r\n\r\nIntegrity:\r\nThis is probably the biggest pain-point for me about this company. They are dishonest, deceptive, and greedy. The company does not value their employees as people. HR needs to be rebranded to reflect their values, drop the Human part because they don't care about people, and only retain the Resource part because they value money. They see people as dollar signs and will lie to get employees to pay out of pocket for education that benefits the company. They also aren't honest on the contract. They only work enough to continue the current one or secure the next one. They don't want to deliver quality, only quality as needed by the contract.\r\n\r\nHere's another story from my personal experience to highlight why you shouldn't work for them. I reported an employee for ongoing sexual conduct which happened continually over the course of three years. The resolution of my report was management swept it under the rug as told me \"accept their behavior because that's how some people just are.\" Those were literally the words given to me. I was in shock that was their view point. Also I've seen too often older employees prey upon new interns and hires. They perpetuate this behavior through selective hiring, employee groups, happy hour socializing, among the many occurrences that I've personally attended.

If someone is gunning for you (this happens frequently) you can be walked out at any time.

VPs seem unbelievably ineffective.  \r\n\r\nHuge problems are appearing in multiple product lines, can be directly traced to year after year of engineering layoffs, all while trying to hire new grads (i.e.: CHEAP labor).

Retaliation happens ALL the time (multiple people who \u2018stuck their head up\u2019, reported something to HR, have been told by HR they should quit, and their lives have been made so difficult that some have quit).  \r\n\r\nThe word ETHICS is rammed down employees throats until we choke on it, but it\u2019s just  a club to beat the employees.  Lots of employees ethics complaints go uninvestigated, unless it is of use to NGC (no visibility into the ethics \u201cprocess\u201d is allowed, so the employees are left wondering).  If there are any ethics complaints against HR, they are investigated by\u2026. HR (I\u2019m SURE HR will have no problem explaining away the ethics of that).  Unqualified minorities are routinely put in positions simply so HR can \u2018check the box\u2019, be prepared to do your job and theirs because SOME people \u201chave to be protected\u201d (direct quote from a staff meeting).\r\n\r\nBe prepared to lose a few civil rights if you work her - NGC rewrote the rules a few years ago and employees CANNOT sue NGC.  You have to go through \u201cmediation\u201d \u2013 guess who picks the mediator?   \r\n\r\nAdvice for new hires:  \r\n\u2022\tIf you must come here, get a VERY high salary coming in (NGC is famous for low-balling \u2013 explains why something like 75% of offers are rejected these days).  \r\n\u2022\tFind out who the \u201cprotected, special people\u201d are and KEEP AWAY from them.  \r\n\u2022\tAvoid HR at all costs.\r\n\u2022\tIt\u2019s more important WHO you work for, than specifically WHAT you are doing.

There is a \"workforce initiative\" which is supposed to mitigate some of the tension related to things like this, but ultimately they do not encourage their work force to use the correct charge numbers for these tasks.  For example, one of their tactics is: your manager will tell you that you get paid for overtime, then (at near future date) reveal that you are not authorized to charge overtime and proceed to tell you X amount of work needs to be completed \"or else.\"  For the particular project I am working on (the postal office's flats sorting project), I had a manager once admit candidly to me that they were told explicitly to use an \"very aggressive software schedule\".  In once instance, after telling a manager it would take 8 days for me to complete something, they told me that I have to do it in 4 and that charging overtime was not allowed.  From talking to other coworkers and my direct bosses openly about the problem, I have gathered that the overtime problem ultimately stems from upper level management (this is good in the sense that the manager directly above you is more often or not \"on your side\", but bad in the sense that the overtime problems are widespread amongst software engineers)."}], [{"review_title": "Love working at NGST", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Oct 2009", "job_title": " in Redondo Beach, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "NGST is a great place to work.

To list a few other more trivial cons; as an engineer the experience you gain will be of no value when you leave because you're engineering nothing, just assembling and testing parts, business travel with extended time away from home, no chance for promotion, engineers with little to no experience are the real managers because the \"managers\" are so weak, people who are called, \"engineers\" but have no engineering degree.  Based on this it's not clear who the boss is.  One manager I dealt with clearly saw us a boy scout troop to be managed in the same way.....\"a leader shall emerge!\".

Been with the company for almost 8 years. Depending where you work, it's like prison. You have to pick a clique to survive here as it's every man/women for themselves. Your co-workers that you thought were your friends at work will not waste anytime to throw you under the bus to make themselves look better. HR seems like they are always on the prowl to get people fired right away. If you don't work for the Aerospace Systems sector, they treat you like the red headed step children. Meanwhile the Aerospace Sector would get bonuses for saving the customer money and give everyone else cake. Don't get me wrong, I'm just lucky to get a paycheck but everyone should be treated equally if they want everyone to go by the motto \"One Site, One Team!\". No matter how hard you work and go out of your way for the company, they will not waste no time at all to point out each and every little mistake you've made. The pay is ok, but could be way better. When I first started with the company it had that family vibe, that is until all the good people left either by retirement or promotion and then  that's when the corporation vibe came in. It went from higher ups knowing you personally by name to now you're just a number. They stress on the importance of people taking these Ethnics training classes annual which is a waste because the company does not follow what they preach. Example, one of the quizzes they give they talk about a gentlemen who's daughter was going to college and wanted to join the company as an intern. Her father happened to know/work with the Manager for the intern spot. They give you multiple choice answers, A). You tell the father that his daughter must apply online like everyone else B). The father gives the Manager his daughters resume and the Manager brings her onboard. Which one is the right way to handle this? Obviously A) was the correct answer however, I have seen instances where apparently the company believes B) is the correct answer on what seems to be on a daily basis. This \"Job\" is just a place holder for me until I add a few more experiences on my resume and will leave. Defiantly not a company you want to put 100% effort in everything you do and not be recognized and then treated like crap.  Lastly, biggest pet peeve with the company; not once I have meet our newest VP's and Vice VP's. Before or best VP and Vice VP left for better things they used to walk around greeting everyone individually, asked how they were doing, and asked if they needed anything. Now we get these newer folks that have not even introduced themselves to anyone; I guess as long as they get there bonus checks every year based off of our hard work there is no need to meet them."}, {"review_title": "Northrop Grumman Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "26 May 2015", "job_title": "Senior Program Manager in Sunnyvale, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent work life balance.

Those without degrees get treated like 2nd to 3rd class citizens, and they will never grow once they reach their capacity.\n\n-The irony of all this is that most of the managers here only have technical degrees with no business experience or education to help them be managers. This leads to a management style and thinking that is only limited to an engineering mindset. This is by far their downside to helping employees grow and feel they are worth something. They believe that management experience is only 20% and technical experience is 80%. If they would only switch these percentages the business and culture would grow tremendously, and their employees would be managed by someone who knows what they were doing. \n\n-If you have a degree you will be treated good, until you hit your capacity, and then they will push you to go get a Masters degree if you want to grow or make more money, regardless of your hard work or experience. \n\nI left the company, which was the best decision I have ever made.

Additionally, this time off is used for both vacation and sick time.  There was previously an option to purchase an additional week of PTO - but this has been phased out for 2010.  So most folks are capped at two weeks of PTO.\r\n\r\nA new change has been made to the PTO time keeping procedures, as well that makes it near impossible to make any money for extra hours worked during any pay period containing a holiday.  So, work on Christmas, get paid your regular hours and the holiday hours are just banked for use later - but holiday pay cannot be carried from year to year - so use it or lose it at the end of the year.  On contracts other than the USPS, half of all PTO has been converted to holiday pay - thus depriving employees of the option of carrying that time over from year to year.\r\n\r\nMost of these changes were not communicated ahead of time - and the lack of communication during the negotiation process left contractors wondering and allowed rumors and poor moral to fester during the run-up to the implementation of these new mandates.\r\n\r\nThe poor handling of the new terms for contractors left the Postal management with a sour taste as well, as they felt that NG balancing their books on the backs of their employees' paychecks was fostering discontent among the contractors - ultimately diminishing the the quality of the \"Product\" being provided by NG."}, {"review_title": "Worst facility I have ever worked in.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Apr 2010", "job_title": "Applications Developer in Grand Prairie, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Colleagues were very friendly and inclusive of new people.

Efficiencies are used to harass employees with unreasonable expectations. First they set the standard to the absolute best time and then they sometimes lower that time for no reason other than some engineer thought it sounded good to reduce time on cables. Also some employees cut sequence steps and complete them in other sequences, further screwing up the efficiencies. If you tell management, lower management is tasked with fixing it, but they don't have any authority to \"change\" anything.\r\n3. Upper management often takes away needed workstations and floor space for their pet projects that never work or just to cram more people in the plant. But employees are expected to perform the same or better with less.\r\n4. Because their efficiencies are messed up and people do different things and sometimes have to work with less, your raise ends up subjectively based; oh and they rank everyone too, so everyone could be great employees, but you could get ranked poorly and have a lesser raise just because.\r\n5. They spent ~$500,000 on a robot that sat the two years I worked there. Never worked and it's never been a \"real\" priority to make it useful. Although management will talk about getting it working. Or the 8 or so tables of floor space taken for a twist machine that took longer to twist than by hand...\r\n6. Overtime. They expect you to work overtime and they usually need it to make up for poor management. If you don't and want some kind of lofe outside work, it'll reflect poorly on raises.\r\n\r\nNow let's consider the location of the plant. It's on an Indian reservation where the price of everything is jacked up (including rent) due to being nowhere and because of all the oil money in the area. So most people commute from Minot which has the best rent prices. So now your ten hour day has about 2 1/2 hours of driving everyday and the company does not care.\r\n\r\nAlso half of the year will be winter and will get below zero for say 2 months of the year.\r\n\r\nWhat else...no HR.
