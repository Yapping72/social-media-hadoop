I was told the position would be more oriented towards lean manufacturing and support. Currently, I run reports and make charts that track how production is progressing rather than actually help production be more efficient. In short, we produce reports, management looks at reports and yells at lower levels to do better. It's abusive and a complete waste of talent. I'm an engineer being paid an ok salary to click buttons.\r\n\r\n-Old and Slow. Business has been slow the past few years and Aerospace Systems continually has been cutting investment. I've never seen a company rely so much on people and machines and then unwillingly invest in them. We literally run machines  24/7 in order to meet schedule, neglect preventative maintenance and when they catastrophically fail, wonder what happened. The same is true of employees.\r\n\r\n-No training, expectation of perfection. I received about an hours worth of training my first day from a co-worker who had been there 30 years and acted as if I was imposing on their time. People are busy, but lacking any formal training or investment in people is egregious. Worse, it's just sad when management fails to give you that training and expects your work to be perfect on the first go. Further, people don't help until their butt is on the line. Otherwise, you tend to be on your own.\r\n\r\n-Huge age gap. Aerospace has been struggling lately and has held onto many tenured employees, while laying off less tenured ones. They then hire in new graduates to back fill a 30+ year employee. I have no problem against older employees, but when you're the only 20 something in a group...you know there's something wrong. To compound that, the company is bleeding younger folks. Most 20 somethings I've met in the company are looking for other jobs outside of Northrop.\r\n\r\n-I feel bad for my managers. Management works about 60+ hours per week, constantly on their blackberry or responding to e-mails. They don't have time to mentor or even meet with employees on a regular basis. Adding to that fact, most of them don't know how to manage. On a regular basis I watch managers berate employees. They ask for turn around times on tasks that are rather impossible and then insult employees when they can't meet those expectations.\r\n\r\n-Raises. I received a 2% raise my first year. This is barely in line with inflation and laughable at best. I've met many folks who've come out of retirement to assist Northrop from \"the glory days\" and they are some of the best and brightest people I've ever met. The company has retired them, cut salaries and recruited cheaper, but less adequate managers whom can't manage and are generally miserable people.\r\n\r\n-Old facilities.

When they catch their employees talking for few seconds, they use that as an excuse to give you more work and less staff support for your team. This is especially apparent for tight-budget programs.\r\n\r\n>>Example 2, some managers make junior engineers to do certain thing in certain method with very short period of time and they announce it to whole program members (without the junior engineer's consent). If it turns out that the methodology is wrong, they blame on the junior engineer for doing it wrong AND out of time. The manager then lies to his functional manager (who is also the junior engineer's functional manager) when he talks with the functional manager in his room. The junior engineer could not blame him, because the manager only directed him/her verbally, not through email (usually takes too long to explain through email anyway). \r\n\r\n>>Example 3, a fellow junior engineer stole another junior, but more senior engineer's effort/work (to make himself look better to the manager) and always criticize more senior engineer in front of his/her manager (again, to make himself look better compared to more senior engineer).\r\n\r\n>>Example 4, a manager tells junior engineer during one-on-one end-of-year performance review that he/she has to work more \"green time\" in order to get highest score on performance review.

Although I had over fifteen years of experience when hired, it was my first experience working for a corporation of that size. Needless to say I had high expectations. To this day I am baffled by the mixture of positives and negatives of my experience there. \r\n\r\nFirst, the positive. Almost everyone I worked with was very friendly from the first day. Professional, courteous, accommodating etc. I was hired part-time on-call yet they gave me 40 hours per week for the entire duration I was there. I was given the software I needed and one of the managers in particular was very helpful in that regard. Most importantly, they also had me working on a very compelling project, the details of which I am unable to discuss here, that enabled me to use my skills in a broad manner. For these things I was grateful.", "cons": "This company apparently has terrible management. One manager (not my direct manager) directly asked me to work for free. He asked me to work on something on my own time since he did not have the budget for it. Being part-time on-call, I felt compelled to oblige him in the hopes that it would lead to permanent employment. \r\n\r\nMy immediate manager appropriated a budget that I was awarded for a project I had conceptualized. This individual took every dime of that budget, such that I could not even pay myself to manage the project. The funding was granted by those in authority high above us, yet there was nothing I could do. I expressed my concern three times to this manager. He actually said, \"I don't mean to cannibalize your budget, but ...\" Yet that is exactly what he was doing. After assuring me that that funding would be based on my needs, he sent me an email, at home, mind you, with a list of everything he had procured, and it consumed the entire budget. \r\n\r\nThe creative director, while always friendly to me, had two large dogs following her around wherever she went. Yes, just like the show The Office, but these were giant poodles. Being part-time on-call, I did not have my own office. I began in a large community cubicle space, and I was then moved into a two-person cube. Problems with noise led me to ask for permission to move into a vacant office nearby. I figured that, given my experience and the fact that I was leading a project, I should have my own office. There was just one problem, however. The office was actually used by the creative director's dogs. Unfortunately for me, I was less important than the poodles.\r\n\r\nThis is actually the point at which I left the company. Perhaps revealing my own naivety, I never imagined such things happening at a company like Northrop Grumman. I considered sticking around, in the hopes of advancing or opening other doors, but in our weekly meetings, on more than one occasion, management made it clear that there was no room for advancement at this particular location.\r\n\r\nIn summary, great people, poor management. I have no evidence that this reality is systemic. The feeling I got was that, in a hiring market, they can choose anyone they want to work there and they will have no problem finding individuals who will tolerate a reality such as I described.

This is incredibly demotivating for employees: they can work hard, meet or exceed all of their goals, and still get a 0% raise.  Years ago the company implemented a policy that disallows brining personal plants to the office - to eliminate using Northrop water for a personal plant.  Benefits costs are skyrocketing as the company tries to eliminate money it spends on employee benefts.  However, Northrop is truly a 1% company.  Executives are treated much differenty than non-management.  VPs and above receive large salary increases, as well as bonuses - while ~50% of the normal people get 0%.  Over years, the company has eliminated many grade levels - making it very difficult to get promoted.  It is a good company to work at for 2 - 3 years, but not for 10 or more."}, {"review_title": "Get in as a higher level engineer (Entry level not advised)", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 Jan 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The 9/80 scheduling is really nice, and you get the last week of the year off.

The quality of food is equivalent to that which is served at senior centers. Mushy and tasteless. And of course the food is over priced.

Depending on what you are looking for Northrop Grumman can provide a person with golden opportunities to grow in one's profession.  As with all other companies of this size there is the usual amount of office politics and throwing the employees under the bus by management to account for their own failures is unfortunately commonplace.  If you are thinking of working for Northrop Grumman chose wisely the section and management you will be working under.  It is possible to reduce your chances of working for a bad manager by asking the right questions.  Talk to one or more employees in the department off the record over the phone during non business hours.  Ask good questions, not \"yes no\" questions.  Once you have found a good department to work for remember to always turn down the first offer and ask for more along with an extra week of vacation on top.  If you take the first offer they will think that you do not hold yourself in good esteem. Once on the inside, remember Northrop Grumman management does not take the lead to grooming employees for promotion, that is the employee's responsibility.   You have to take care of your career development and carefully guide it in the right direction.  Otherwise you will not grow and without growth your value over time will diminish and your pay raises will follow in step.  Along those lines never stay in one location more than two years, you must move yourself in order to grow.  Always look for and take on opportunities to demonstrate and build your leadership skills.   You will know where you stand in the department ranking, make sure you are in the top 20%.  If not move yourself to another department ASAP.  Always be on your guard, watch what you say and do, the management is not the only people who are going to throw you under the bus.  It is a good idea not to use the company internet, phone, or email for personal use, all such media is monitored by the company.  Trust no one, no exceptions.", "cons": "Depending on which sector of the company you work for the work environment can vary quite a bit. Northrop Grumman is composed of a series of smaller companies that were acquired over time and each has retained their own culture and values to some degree. While the parent corporation has been making adjustments to equalize the differences between the various companies, it is only at the benefits level and has yet to alter the personality and culture of the existing management that much.   Over time the leaders within each acquisition will be replaced or re-educated, and those who cannot make the adjustment will be offered a golden handshake or demoted out of the way.  At the employee level little change has been observed as a result, except the unusual number of email notices of changes in management and promotions.  What does all this have to do with the question?  Any good reviews of NG does not mean the whole company is the same.  To be honest, currently the employees to some degree feel disenfranchised, they also feel that their management lacks autlntcity.   Along with layoffs of very loyal, long term employees, this has lead to demotivation that in turn lowers productivity and in a few cases raises issues concerning quality of workmanship at the customer level.  The bulk of the employees are trapped in Northrop Grumman and take the abuse of their management. this is due to current economic conditions. They are unable to escape to something better and management tells them they will not be able to find another job.  Once the economic conditions change, and they will,  one would expect an exodus away from the company of key staff members and the corporate managers know this is the case.  To head off this brain drain, and to pick up morale, they corporate management,  have started a review process of managers in hopes of giving the employee a sense of empowerment while leveling a degree of stress on management levels to improve their performance since the feedback polls will effect their ranking to some small degree. It remains to be seen if this latest corporate per rock will produce the desired results.  No matter what the result is corporate will declare it a success.  Remember you are a \"at will\" employee, which means they hire and fire at will, this means your loyalty to NG or any company is the equal to the loyalty they show you."}, {"review_title": "Too disorganized for a large corporation", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Mar 2012", "job_title": "Electromechanical Engineer T04 in Redondo Beach, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The average person is very friendly.

Despite Northrop being the supposed leader in UAVs, it's software practices are terribly out of date. It's partially due to the industry and the length of the projects though. When a new project starts up, new tools are used and implemented, however those same tools will be used the entire way through, even if the project is more than a decade old. Trying to upgrade these tools or acquire new tools is a constant fight uphill with IT and layers of approval from upper management. \r\n2. Another con is not really a fault of NGC, but rather a reality of the industry. They are government contractors, and therefore bill the government a certain amount of man hours. This requires Software Engineers to always clock the hours. This is very out of the norm compared to the rest of the industry and takes a bit to get used to. \r\n3. There was a recent change to the rating program that rewards the top performers in the department with high score (5 or 4), normal performers with an average score (3), and poor performers with a poor score (2). This score is used to make the argument for raises and promotions for employees. On paper this sounds great, however a key detail is that only the top performers in the entire department are rewarded. This means even if you're a top performer in your own group, you can and probably will be passed for a higher score because only a percentage of 5's and 4's in the entire department. Managers convene to fight for the employees to get better scores, and use info written up by employees to help their argument.

Only 8 hours are allowed to be carried from one month to the next.  The company also allows employees to work a schedule 9-80, providing for an extra day off every other week.  Managers are understanding about the importance of life outside the office and rarely force you to come in on off days, prevent vacation, or make you work certain hours.  There are good policies put in place to pay for work related training or classes outside of work.  If you are a US citizen and can obtain certain clearances, Northrop will pay you a premium.  Northrop is such a large company that it is easy to try out different business areas and job roles.  Managers are pretty good about putting you in touch with someone to help make that happen.", "cons": "The company maintains many of the same beliefs as the government when it comes to raises, promotions, hirings/firings, performance reviews, and overall bureaucracy.  Many people are promoted due to the number of years worked for the company as opposed to actual performance.  It really takes a huge act to get fired from the company.  If someone actually performs poorly they are just shuffled around to a position that management feels is less important.  This causes there to be groups (Testing, CM) where absolutely nothing gets done.  Lower level management is also forced by upper management to greatly consider diversity.  This makes it very difficult to always find good hires.  Many times management will just hire diverse, but unqualified workers and place them in one of those groups they deem to be unimportant. Even if someone greatly exceeds expectations and receives great reviews, there are rules put in place on the maximum raise they can receive (~15%).  This greatly affects new hires as their initial salary is based on degree, grades, school attended, etc.  I have seen a range of starting salaries from 46 to 68K for the same position.  The performance reviews are also a joke.  The actual functional managers are very disconnected from their directs, so workers tell their managers who they would like to have do their reviews at the end of the year.  This means that employees do not obtain any real feedback and what they do receive does not help them do any of their tasks any better.  One of the reasons people used to work for Northrop was to work an easy job for life and then receive a decent pension.  That is no longer the case as Northrop has phased out pensions.  Due to all the bureaucracy, the technology used by the company is as up-to-date as the private industry.

Presumably the company's solution, from what I've gathered, is that I am to be assigned to someone to learn alongside them. However it took weeks for that to actually happen in my case. Even then, rather than formalized points of contact, I just have a loose list of people I should talk to, all of whom are always busy and react to my questions with short patience at best, outright annoyance at worst. Independent training is all but impossible. I have tried using internal resources to shore up my understanding, but such information either doesn't exist, is scattered into some database I haven't heard of (this is an issue my manager has been having as well), or is out of date. Routinely I'd find a relevant piece of information, go to learn what I need to be doing to complete my job, and only find broken links when I actually go to investigate. I'm given conflicting information on how to handle problems, often by the same persons. What finally pushed me to write this review was an issue happening again:  being told by an advisor to contact one person for information, then being told off for bothering that person and not knowing better that I should have been able to do it myself. This is even worse when I was, in fact, fully capable of doing something myself but was given incorrect information, that I -had- to go to someone else. Routinely being made to feel foolish, told I'm ready to launch meetings despite missing crucial components, the utter lack of training, all being made out to be my fault, makes me want to leave immediately.\r\n\r\nTalking with other new employees, it seems to be a problem they aren't having. Reaching out to other friends in related STEM companies and laboratories, however, to people who share my demographic background, my experiences are sounding more universal. I have regrettably come to the conclusion that a lot of the talk of the company about inclusion is empty. It's something that sounds good on a corporate headline, looks good in trade magazines and news publications, but even if it's the official position of the company, it's not reflected in the culture. It's a Defense Contractor, this is probably inevitable.\r\n\r\nMy takeaway is that if you're a typical white male, you'll have no problems here. You will likely find a wonderful career.

Kids of VPs, Directors and other bigwigs enjoy backdoor entry and accelerated promotions.  A manager recently slipped up and blurted that, after an employee has been at NG 8 years, management figures that he/she will not leave, and tightens up the raises accordingly.  There is a vast disparity in the way supervisors conduct annual reviews, and corporate policy contributes to the byzantine process by implementing raises every 15 months or so, disconnecting the eval & raise events.  Promotion inside one's own rut is rife with Catch-22 pitfalls.

No clear leadership or management career path development."}]]
