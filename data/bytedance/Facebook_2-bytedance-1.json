The company is incredibly large, so scope for horizontal movement could potentially be very good if you are looking to come in and reskill over the course of a couple of years.", "cons": "You will quickly realise, as per other reviews - this company has no concern for the wellbeing of its employees or the morality/ethical practice of business. They simply want route to cash as quick as humanly possible - and it shows. At a macro level you may hear of 'copycat' softwares coming out of this region, and this company is in the epicentre of it. Competitor analysis took a new meaning here, as to define every single move and practice the company made.\r\n\r\nThe company is heavily skewed towards Chinese employees, for which they have exported to every corner of the globe to attempt to maintain a stranglehold control on the management layer of the business. I would estimate that 90% of the management at the company is Chinese and to your eyes, seem vastly underqualified for their roles otherwise. Make no mistake, if you do not speak Mandarin at this company - your views will not be trusted or taken into consideration. You will be an 'outsider'. Note that even the American TikTok CEO lasted only a month before resigning. \r\n\r\nDespite being a senior hiring manager, I did not get the final say on who I would employ, what their duties were to be, or be seen to achieve if I set up my employees to be successful. I would be seen as 'in competition' with the people I hired the entire time.\r\n\r\nAside from the issues above, there are wider problems. The company suffers from a deep lack of transparency. We would often find out about major company changes or moves from popular news platforms before we would get any kind of internal notification (if acknowledged at all) and there is a general secretive nature about the business which unsettles both employees and prospective customers.\r\n\r\nIf you are not Chinese, and are expecting to make this company successful outside of the Chinese regions for a product which is not core (TikTok advertising) I would strongly suggest you considering other employment opportunities. You will have limited scope for success, growth and otherwise gain experience which is not relevant to other companies at this business."}, {"review_title": "Be careful if you're not in TikTok", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- High salary and excellent benefits.", "cons": "- If you're joining ByteDance to work on something that isn't in TikTok think twice about it.
