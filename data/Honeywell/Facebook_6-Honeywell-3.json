If you do actually get your time off it takes weeks to get caught up and you end up working OT just to get caught up. \nSpeaking of OT, you do get paid OT as straight time but only after you work 8 free hours for the company. OT doesn\u2019t start until after you work 48 hours for the week. \nUpper management doesn\u2019t understand the differences between the two manufacturing facilities in Mason and St. Louis. They try to make policies that fit everyone but instead it usually benefits the Mason office over St. Louis. \nProcesses, processes processes. You will get lost in the amount of different processes you have to deal with for every department. Oh and once you get a handle on it they will change them to make them \u201ceasier.\u201d But when they change them they\u2019ll still keep the old ones so you\u2019ll have some people using old ones and some people using new ones. Everything got super discombobulated when they started to implement a new scheduling program that is supposed to be the be all end all for schedules, communication, and storage but they didn\u2019t roll it out properly so half the company didn\u2019t know how to use it and when you did learn it broke down every other day. \nDifferent departments always try to push blame on someone else when something goes wrong. \nManufacturing schedules were behind by months but Sales continued to sell projects with unrealistic timelines and no one stopped them from doing it. \nCommunication with manufacturing was a nightmare because you never knew who to talk to, who was telling the truth or you just never heard back from them. \nEarlier in 2021 we were told we\u2019d be working remotely indefinitely and they\u2019re were discussions about allowing people in the future to work remote or in office but it\u2019d be their choice. Come July we\u2019re told we will be slowly forcing everyone back in the office by September. Out of no where we get an e-mail at the end of July \u201cEveryone is expected back in the office 2 weeks from today with rotating schedules\u201d they went back on their word twice. Management asked what schedules we\u2019d prefer for the rotating schedule or if we\u2019d prefer to just continue to work remote. They didn\u2019t listen to any of the requests and made their own decisions. (Also all this happened directly after the company put out anonymous surveys to all employees regarding their opinion of the company)\nTurnover for every department was high (makes you wonder why)\nThey added responsibilities onto the Program Specialists constantly but didn\u2019t change our pay. \nChanged our title structure with no notice and this caused our salary potential to decrease drastically. \nIt used to be 5 steps before you moved into a management role and they changed it to 3 steps but the salary difference didn\u2019t change from step 1-3. \nWhen they changed it they didn\u2019t audit where people actually were at with their careers and tried to give some people the highest titles with a low salary with no more room for growth. \nI could keep going but you get the point."}, {"review_title": "Work Opportunities at Honeywell", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "9 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Honeywell works on some excellent technologies with focus on Sustainability & Digitization\r\n- Leading Industrial company\r\n- Competitive pay", "cons": "- High Work pressure\r\n- Frequent leadership changes"}, {"review_title": "Long Hiring Process, but mine wasn't typical", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Quality Engineer II in Spokane, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Very pleasant interview process in total\r\n-Constant Communication with recruiter\r\n-Great Pay Offered", "cons": "-Poor conveyance on expectations\r\n-Lack of intuitiveness with hiring portal\r\n-Inconsistent scheduling\r\n-No clarity or feedback post interview"}, {"review_title": "Demanding", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 May 2022", "job_title": "Professional", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Earnings outlook, career progression, hybrid workforce.", "cons": "Work life balance, demanding timelines, firedrills"}, {"review_title": "Aero", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "MOS in place\r\nGreat Products and technology", "cons": "Heavy process, less agility, Dynamics not understood"}], [{"review_title": "Demanding", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 May 2022", "job_title": "Professional", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Earnings outlook, career progression, hybrid workforce.", "cons": "Work life balance, demanding timelines, firedrills"}, {"review_title": "Aero", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "MOS in place\r\nGreat Products and technology", "cons": "Heavy process, less agility, Dynamics not understood"}, {"review_title": "Personal opinion", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to learn new things", "cons": "Work life balance isn't good\r\nCompensation is not so good"}, {"review_title": "Great company to work with", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Finance Analyst in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work with .had a wonderful system which helps employees to learn", "cons": "No cons are there.the hike is not giving while i was working there according to the educational qualifications"}, {"review_title": "Good Workplace to build your career", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Systems Engineer in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent employee benefits\r\nHassle Free On-Boarding process\r\nCareer Building Opportunities and Scope", "cons": "Some process takes time to get completed.

If you do actually get your time off it takes weeks to get caught up and you end up working OT just to get caught up. \nSpeaking of OT, you do get paid OT as straight time but only after you work 8 free hours for the company. OT doesn\u2019t start until after you work 48 hours for the week. \nUpper management doesn\u2019t understand the differences between the two manufacturing facilities in Mason and St. Louis. They try to make policies that fit everyone but instead it usually benefits the Mason office over St. Louis. \nProcesses, processes processes. You will get lost in the amount of different processes you have to deal with for every department. Oh and once you get a handle on it they will change them to make them \u201ceasier.\u201d But when they change them they\u2019ll still keep the old ones so you\u2019ll have some people using old ones and some people using new ones. Everything got super discombobulated when they started to implement a new scheduling program that is supposed to be the be all end all for schedules, communication, and storage but they didn\u2019t roll it out properly so half the company didn\u2019t know how to use it and when you did learn it broke down every other day. \nDifferent departments always try to push blame on someone else when something goes wrong. \nManufacturing schedules were behind by months but Sales continued to sell projects with unrealistic timelines and no one stopped them from doing it. \nCommunication with manufacturing was a nightmare because you never knew who to talk to, who was telling the truth or you just never heard back from them. \nEarlier in 2021 we were told we\u2019d be working remotely indefinitely and they\u2019re were discussions about allowing people in the future to work remote or in office but it\u2019d be their choice. Come July we\u2019re told we will be slowly forcing everyone back in the office by September. Out of no where we get an e-mail at the end of July \u201cEveryone is expected back in the office 2 weeks from today with rotating schedules\u201d they went back on their word twice. Management asked what schedules we\u2019d prefer for the rotating schedule or if we\u2019d prefer to just continue to work remote. They didn\u2019t listen to any of the requests and made their own decisions. (Also all this happened directly after the company put out anonymous surveys to all employees regarding their opinion of the company)\nTurnover for every department was high (makes you wonder why)\nThey added responsibilities onto the Program Specialists constantly but didn\u2019t change our pay. \nChanged our title structure with no notice and this caused our salary potential to decrease drastically. \nIt used to be 5 steps before you moved into a management role and they changed it to 3 steps but the salary difference didn\u2019t change from step 1-3. \nWhen they changed it they didn\u2019t audit where people actually were at with their careers and tried to give some people the highest titles with a low salary with no more room for growth. \nI could keep going but you get the point."}, {"review_title": "As corporate as it can get", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Applications Engineer II in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "large scale real-time engineering challenges and tasks", "cons": "too many loosely connected technologies, few too old for today"}, {"review_title": "Very good opportunities.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "15 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Field Service Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A lot of opportunities, a lot of different jobs and structures.", "cons": "International infrastructure makes everything slower.
