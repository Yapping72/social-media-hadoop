Although Singtel prides itself of having a good, strong and ethical culture, its processes, systems and abilities lack depth to inculcate them into the lower levels i.e., ground people. Example, it prides itself as a culture of being open and gives room for its people to make small incremental mistakes in a low-risk environment, but if the leader of that team doesn't practice that, well.. that team is well out of luck. AND, the deadliest mistake of all - working in silos. Having worked with various internal stakeholders from different BUs, most, but not all, are obtuse to processes outside of their BU's scope.

Some have joined the company when they were 17 year old and now pushing 65 years. Although retirement is 62, they are offered reemployment on a yearly basic until 68. The main issue with this is that these staffs are supervisors for decades amd still in management role after retirement. They don't accept new ideas and their education qualifications are stagnant since 1970s. Because of these fresh polytechnic graduates are unable to assume their roles and there is little room for fresh blood to climb the ladder. Many young and potential staffs resign and jump to another company instead. Salary is low if you compare to industry standards. They pay increment is only 2 digits on a yearly basis or on an average 1 to 3% of the base pay. Even if you get promoted, it is 3 to 4% of the base pay and not attractive enough. There is practically no WFH or Flexible work routine in Customer Operations or customer service. The company shows in LinkedIn and in the press that they practice hybrid work routine but for majority of Customer care in consumer operation, this is non existent. Even during Covid, there is no WFH. For a company that boost that they are industrial leader for innovation and technology, this is rather backwards. When questioned why there is WFH, they will give excuses such as PDPA and unable to bring Customer details home. In current times, even banks and government employees who are handling sensitive information are allowed to work from home. There is no half day or time off before major public holidays. They follow a clean desk policy where no handphone, paper, pen or bag allowed in the office. You will have to place them in the locker.
