You will very easily find people that will be your friends for life and while it is hard to find a good job, it is harder to find a good team. I think in Shopify, this is more common.\n- Shopify does have lots of room to learn and grow as a developer (unless you\u2019re a FED)", "cons": "To work at Shopify, you have to be okay with the fact that part of your paycheck will come from gun paraphernalia and far-right propaganda merchandise shops who use that money to fuel their ambitions, all while at the same time having leadership give 1-hour conference talks about how commerce and Shopify are morally good and that Shopify is good for society. Which I am sure for a lot of people is fine, and may start off fine as well, but it can also get very tiring over time as you see one thing and then leadership tells you another. Here are some of my main feelings about this company.\n\n- It is always very obvious when leadership decides to not address something that they don\u2019t like, which they often do, and often about very important things like compensation or attrition. Usually, they will not be able to answer questions and dodge them, and then suddenly every single person in leadership suddenly has the exact same answer about how this new change that you think is negative, is actually positive. Compensation is actually the best in the industry (when it proveably is not)\n- Backward promotion. I suppose these are common but still a criticism. To get promotions or raise, you will have had to do the job for a year or more already. This is a good way to underpay high-performing people. \n- Work-life balance is not real. especially if you are a manager. Directors and senior staff will message at any time of day. They will say that balance is important and they spent all of \u201cMental Health Month\u201d talking about this but then go on to push harder deadlines for Unite, an annual conference hosted by Shopify. They say the R&R days (4 day work week) should not make your work more but the deadlines stay the same.\n- Constantly shifting organization structure and constant release of new useless terminology. Often getting the sense that leadership uses this as an excuse to explain what work that they are doing. Sometimes their announcements of reorgs or new words to describe the work we already do, have a feeling of being made up on the spot and always end on a note of work in progress. This adds to the feeling of instability because they want us to use what they have come up with on a day-to-day basis but it could change at any moment. It also always make you feel as much f you are a pawn or resource to be moved around without regard to building community and relationships. (Which causes managers to use this as a reason to not promote or give raises)\n- Pretending to be open when in fact at AMAs, the hardest questions are skipped over to the extent that they have made a team build tools to filter out questions that are too hard and report employees to HR if they asked questions that leadership doesn\u2019t like or seems too critical. The same team built tools into slack, to direct report any employee to HR which almost immediately killed all slack discussions that were in any way critical of the company, even good-faith criticism. \n- Leadership lacks accountability and refuses to listen to feedback. Usually, when asked for accountability, they will say something along the lines that the conversation has become unproductive and wasting company time. This will often just result in slack channels being changed to read-only, forcing the conversation into other channels.\n- When I joined the company, they marked themselves as a hacker culture. Everything was hackable, including the company itself. So often we had discussions about what the company could do better and how it could be better. Currently, Shopify has a culture of constantly telling its employees that if you don\u2019t like what the company does, then you should leave. This position was used for remote working as well. They are hostile and gaslighting to employees who have dissenting opinions or criticism. \n- Most of the good culture that Shopify still retains is from the people they have hired in the past and good lower-level managers having great connections with their small teams. The company as a whole is seemingly doing nothing to support everyone other than half-assed mental health statements and talking about a future where they will fly the whole company to central points once a year. This is odd because in the same breath they will mention how environmentally conscious they are.\n- Criticisms of the company are cast as direct attacks on C-levels, who are surrounded by cult-like people who think they can do no wrong. Echo chamber at the top to the extent that it seems obvious that there is a house clearing of any dissenting directors or C-levels.\n- C-level execs are highly involved but are not highly informed. They will often say incorrect things, very confidently.\n- Leadership has a poor opinion of UX and front-end, as displayed in the past by CEO comments on Twitter and the fact that the UX role was eliminated from Shopify. It has taken years of advocacy to get front-end developers paid nearly the same amount as backends. Leadership will often go on tirades about how no one should write javascript at all, even though javascript powers a lot of what the company does now.\n- Work is not appreciated across teams, highly competitive and if the team did not create it, they will just create their own and try to destroy the other.\n- Very strong not-built-here mentality where Shopify tends to rebuild things that already have solutions.\n- I would feel bad for Tobi if he was not often rudely opinionated and surrounded by people who will protect him at any time. I get that he has a hard position where he is expected to run a company but still looks like (or still wants to be) highly connected to the technical aspects of dev however it is clear that he cannot. And that is completely fine. However, when he reads an article or tries something out in his spare time, he tries to push people to use things in order to feel relevant but it is clear that he has not used the technology in a sustained way. If he only brought items up as a suggestion of something he is interested in rather than something he is telling technical team that they should already be using, these would be taken a lot better, however, because of the way he approaches items like this, he wastes massive amounts of time as teams are constantly consumed with building up a case to tell him in a fully data-driven way an answer they could have just told him at the start. I mean, there has been enough coverage of Tobi tornadoes, I don\u2019t need to re-hash.\n- Managers have very little feedback loop. There is no way in Shopify to evaluate a bad manager who is causing their employees to have a bad experience. It is common for ICs to talk about who is a good lead and who is not because the only hope is to avoid the bad ones. Managers are mostly evaluated by the work their team produces and their ability to explain those things in meetings. So when managers are deliberately not promoting or doing terrible things like punitive PIPs, there is no hope for those ICs except to change teams.\n- Hiring has no feedback loop. There are many people who participate in interviews that are very pretentious and biased but there is no way to tell how well interviewers are performing. We hire with committees so everyone needs to come to an agreement to combat bias but if the whole committee is full of bad interviewers then it is doing nothing for bias. I was trained years ago, which was reading a few documents and shadowing two interviews, and then nothing ever since.\n- Shopify hires with a pretty strong requirement of using TDD however in practice, I would say a small minority of the people at Shopify actually practice true TDD, which just seems hypocritical.\n- New hires often get paid more that tenured staff, with very reserved raises. Which is fine if you were just hired, that will only sting a few years in.\n- Promotions are really a popularity contest. The loudest, most visible people get promoted the most, the quiet but highly productive people rarely get recognition."}, {"review_title": "Disappointed", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Designer in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits and flex comp is helpful.

As a Support Advisor, you are expected to take minimal breaks for operational efficiency, manage 3 chats on top of reaching out to escalated teams, offer merchant success/products, respond to each merchant within 3 minutes + 3 minute or less chat wrap ups for your notes.. oh and also you only get 30 minutes for lunch. Lunch goes by so fast that sometimes it feels just as stressful as being on my computer during my shift I pushed through the first 9 months doing really well, felt like I was creating impact, and excelling - only to realize that I'm most likely not going to be leaving my Support Advisor position for long long time. The layoffs have slowed internal hiring and also I just feel so burnt out. They expect you to demonstrate your impact on the company on top of a very exhausting role in order to be noticed or move up in the company. At first, I was so eager to do this - I worked hours after work and took on more initiative with my team to be noticed and receive a positive/high positive impact but it has not paid off at all. It also fosters a culture of toxic positivity, where you have to be excited about your role, and upbeat in order to get promoted but really you are just suffering in silence and not able to truly shoot the s**t about Shopify I've been struggling with my mental health for the whole Fall season as the demand on chats/phones has been extraordinarily high. I have been even taking unpaid time off to take care of my mental health. If you take off too much unpaid time however, this will be viewed negatively as you are not fulfilling your role and it's not operationally effective. Again, It's all about \"mental health, work-life-balance\" but that only applies if you are not in Support. Support is expected to have \"resiliency\" to push through, work until 7 pm, and still provide excellent customer service. Support gets underpaid but is the backbone of the company. My biggest pet peeve is the praise that Shopify gets for offering unlimited PTO, or a nice long break over the holidays but this only applies to every other team but Support.

Yet we are doing the most work and are the backbone here. Shopify tries to justify the horrible work situation with toxic positivity with our benefits. We are underpaid for the workload and baggage we deal with on the daily basis compared to other call centre type positions, but this is justified as we 'work from home'. During my interview I was told that it would not be common to have 3 chats at once apart from during large sales or holidays (Christmas, BFCM, EOFY etc). While this was the case when I first started, as soon as they sacked of 10% of the company in July 2022 it has been getting worse every month. Since November we have had 3 chats back to back all day long, and calls back to back. You are very lucky if in the last 2 hours of your shift you only have 2 chats at a time. Handling 3 complex technical chats at once, troubleshooting and solving each individual issue at the same time, not leaving each merchant on read for more than 3 minutes, and offering tailored business advice for each merchant is not easy to manage for 5.5 hours. Also the people who grade our tickets are too harsh and are not realistic, doing your job is not good enough here unless you give 10000000% to each interaction you have, which is not possible. The company acts like they want you to move onto new positions in the company but I have a feeling this will not be possible for a long time, as they are not hiring in most positions since the layoffs. I can imagine that this company is amazing for those above SSA/SA roles. But advisors obviously are treated like dirt on the ground compared to other roles, and our voices are not heard. Everyone I know is struggling mentally and most people around me are/have quit or are actively looking for other jobs. The more people that leave, the busier it gets as they are not hiring. I can only imagine it getting much worse before management finally cares about our mental health and starts to hire again. I would absolutely love to stay to get into another role (as I joined Shopify to be a stepping stone for my career in tech), but I just don't know if my weekly breakdowns and deteriorating mental health is worth waiting another year for them to start hiring in other roles that I am already qualified for and would be happier in.

We have many good people here and the culture was good until recently", "cons": "It has been utter chaos recently. Let me give a few specific examples:\n\n1. Disastrous new compensation system rollout - Missed deadlines (new system delayed for months), unfulfilled promises (not everyone got a raise, sublevel never implemented), ban on employee discussion (slack channel for comp discussion got shut down)... The most iconic event was when our leadership team delayed the new system reveal at the last minute after months of delay and then came back the next day spending 40 minutes explaining how we can slide a bar to choose more or less cash / equity. \n\n2. Disappointing leadership - When being asked about 4-day work week, our CEO started touting the idea of 996 (work 9a to 9p, 6 days a week) from China lol. After the disastrous comp rollout and 10% layoff, our COO implemented a PIP policy for Slack channels - basically any channel that does not help get work done (aka fit leadership narrative) will be archived\n\n3. Good culture breaking down - With the recent acquisition of Deliverr, we are approaching it with \"Default to secrecy\" mindset. It's totally against our \"Default to open internally\" culture. Deliverr + 6 River System (another company we acquired) folks are banned from our main slack and many other tools which makes collaboration extremely difficult. They had to get VP approval to even talk to us / use some of the tools. \n\n4. Low pay - Even with the new comp system still pays peanuts. Many capable employees I know are leaving because of comp + disappointing leadership. Recommend leetcode harder and go to a FANG\n\n5. Reorg with no end in sight and makes no sense - Many teams are disorganized and reorgs keep happening."}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Growth Marketing Lead in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people - you will meet and work with an insanely smart, caring, and wonderful group of humans.

Workers don't get a say on what stores get to stay on the platform, we simply have to accept the CEO's whims of what he feels should be allowed at the time. Most recently, Shopify has been refusing to deplatform Libs of Tik Tok, a store belonging to a page by the same name that promotes harassment of LGBTQ+ people and their allies. The store simply sells three items which all say \"Stop grooming our children\". If you have eyes and a brain, it's easy to deduce this is hate speech directed towards members of the LGBTQ+ community, particularly transgender people. These words have become the new slogan of the anti-trans movement, which seeks to completely erase the existence of transgender people, through any means possible. On the eve of the Club Q massacre, where two transgender people were killed by a gunman (and 3 others murdered), Shopify still refuses to drop this store. This company would rather step over the dead bodies of transgender people before banning a store that has been inciting violence and terrorist attacks on LGBTQ+ spaces for several years. Once you get past that nature of working at Shopify, there's a lot of bureaucracy and mismanagement to contend with. Since the layoffs, everyone across every department is spread too thin, causing poorly thought out launches. The pay is also still not at a very competitive standard and the new compensation system is incredibly confusing to navigate. Since Slack is heavily monitored and regulated, it's also very hard to share any kind of opinion or feedback. Hence the rise in negative Glassdoor reviews.

After the layoffs, immediate investments of other companies took place, and the re-hiring of those same positions that were laid off just weeks prior. Let's talk about compensation, which has been a HUGE turn off in attracting top talent to Shopify. Pay is extremely low compared to other similar companies. They just released a new comp structure which allows the employee to allocate their equity to their base salary if wanted. As unique as this is, it is not a solution and is only a way for the company to analyze their cash flow (probably in preparation for more layoffs). It's all smoke & mirrors. This company acquires other start ups to build upon their fulfillment foundation which arguably should include communication between legacy Shopifolk and said acquired companies, but they've done a GREAT job of separating the two and restricting communication. As a company that advertises a cross-functional working environment, they do a terrible job in living up to that. TL;DR: You can't GSD (get sh** done (Shopify's motto)) when there's virtually no way to communicate with others in the company. (ie: two separate slack instances, two separate email domains, two separate and concealed contact lists). Slack police exist here. So be very very mindful of what you say on slack. You are constantly censored. \"Make commerce better for everyone\" is their value, yet they proceeded to restrict the amazon buy button being embedded onto customer's store fronts. Not okay, and goes against everything Shopify used to be.

This company has gone straight downhill over the course of the pandemic. I've been working here for years and have watched this company encounter and overcome many challenges, like the Breitbart scandal and the \"Slack Commandments\"/Diversity scandal. Those were struggles but we came through them.\r\n\r\nNow, leadership has completely lost the plot. Where there was once an idea of employee empowerment, now there is just unquestioning servitude. The internal culture of fun and transparent communication underlying the work being performed has died. Internal communication channels are being gutted left right and center for discussing \"taboo\" topics like compensation and diversity. Leadership won't even address the topics, they just lock the channel and drop a robotic line about how the conversations aren't \"productive\", even though these are community channels rather than work channels and aren't intended to be productive as a fundamental.\r\n\r\nEmployees have been vocally critical about this excessive internal censorship, but leadership has decided to double down and find even more ways to ensure that difficult questions don't have to be answered. Historically, at company summits, there would be a Q&A panel where senior leadership members would answer questions asked through an app provided to attendees, with the option to ask anonymously should you desire that protection (and lets face it, many difficult questions do require it). Now, it was dropped last minute before this year's Q&A panel that if you wanted to ask senior leadership a question, you would have to take the microphone in hand and ask it directly to their face on stage in front of hundreds of people. They spun it as \"fun\", but really it's an extremely transparent attempt to stifle any and all critical questions from being asked, as nobody would be willing to publicly out themselves as a potential \"dissenter\".\r\n\r\nAfter months of promising a comp update that would re-align our salary levels with our industry talent competitors, the numbers were finally adjusted and they are literally a joke. Many people receiving completely insubstantial adjustments that don't even account for inflation, let alone constitute being a raise, let alone come close to being competitive. You can easily find other companies on LinkedIn right now hiring for my role with more than 50% higher opening salaries, and that's after my \"realignment\"."}, {"review_title": "Disappointing", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jul 2022", "job_title": "User Experience Designer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The only positives come from working with my direct team members.\r\n\r\nI can easily say I\u2019m surrounded by smart, hardworking people.", "cons": "Shopify has always been a company I strived to work for in my career however my experience has been a let down.\r\n\r\nNo culture, censorship, lack of communication, broken promises, and poor compensation and just a few things that SLT has shown."}, {"review_title": "Could be great but leadership is ruining the company", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Data Scientist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Coworkers are nice and interesting people usually.\nCore product is decent and makes money.", "cons": "Leadership is incompetent and running the company into the ground.

This financially crippled me, as any sick days beyond the ten given are unpaid, and the salary barely covers my cost of living to begin with. $42,500 CAD annually (before tax) is not a living wage in 2022. The $5000 annual \"lifestyle fund\" makes your annual salary just over $47,000 except you have to spend that $5k how they want you to, rather than just getting it as pay (I think they get tax breaks for doing it this way). During my first annual impact review, after 1 year of going above and beyond, I was rewarded with a \"positive impact\" which equaled a $1,100 CAD raise (ANNUAL - and before tax lol). This felt like a slap in the face. Earlier this year, Shopify announced they would \"revisit compensation\" in July and give us an above-poverty wage.. this was never mentioned again and did not happen (it is now the end of July). They continue to add more workload and expectations on us, while simultaneously giving nothing back. The micro-managing is extreme, you will be asked why you took a longer break than 20 minutes throughout your entire INSANELY stressful day. If you set yourself to 2 chats maximum rather than 3 to avoid a mental breakdown, or go pee, or finish eating lunch since a 30 minute lunch is not long enough, or try be remotely human - you will be asked why. If you decide to work here, know that if anything tragic happens in your life you will not be supported or taken care of by the company. This job is for you if you never have bad mental health days, if you don't experience anxiety as it is unbelievably stressful, or if you are never physically sick. It's also for you if you don't value having a set or predictable schedule, as scheduling is a mess. Shopify knows that everybody in the Support Advisor role is burnt out, we even had a team meeting about \"how to avoid burnout\" and it was just a slideshow of all ways that WE can \"look at burnout positively\" or how WE can \"better take care of ourselves\" - rather than the company taking action to advocate for us or change their expectations. Reminds me of my narcissistic ex who gaslit me. The expectation to handle 3 incredibly technical chats at once, all the while being forced to bring up business coaching and cringe sales-pitchy conversations tailored to the specific customers is mind-boggling. It is all tracked and marked/graded vigilantly. You will be docked points if you fail to have a holistic business coaching conversation while juggling 3 technical chats at once. How they think this is humanly possible is beyond me. Once the shimmer of the training kool-aid and the love bombing gift/swag boxes wears off (and it will) you'll wonder why you are giving so much while receiving nothing in return. There are many tech companies out there who offer unlimited personal/sick time, pay a living wage to keep up with inflation, and actually have room for growth in the company - if you have plans to move up from the Support Advisor role, all the best; it is nearly impossible. Please continue your search - you deserve better than Shopify - avoid it."}, {"review_title": "Good Culture and People", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture that enables high level of support for everyone and good work/life balance.", "cons": "The culture is slowly shifting into a new space as many old folks are leaving and twice as many new folks are joining (bringing in a new spectrum of personalities) and, thus, the change in culture which at the moment seems to be becoming more worse than better."}, {"review_title": "Bad Exec Decision Making", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Lead Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "WFH, work life balance, slow paced, lacks accountability so you don't ever get in trouble.", "cons": "Reorgs every 6 months that are poorly planned.

They won't even allow you apply for any other role while in support.\n\nDon't get me started on the 3 chats being enforced. It is very unreliastic handling 3 chats with different merchants coming in with 3 different issues. It is very obvious that Shopify does not care about how support staff are coping with all of this. It is not possible that a support staff can handle 3 chats at the same time and be able to keep up with the 3 minutes \"effective time\" which means that if you take longer than 3 minutes to follow up with your merchant, you are graded low in the tickets that would be marked by quite a number inexperienced staff who haven't even done support before and just \"read it up\".\n\nThe ticket grading is done by different people with different opinions so one person can give you his/her opinion on what to do next time in an email/chat/phone call conversation with a merchant and then another person would reduce points for you when you followed the first person's advise.\n\nThey have people watching your every move like a hawk so when you stay just one minute longer on break/lunch, you would be contacted to find out \"if all is well\"....lol\n\nThey enforce the whole merchant growth conversation where you have to keep providing opportunities for growth to merchants which can easily derail your chats with merchants who just wants their problem solved so they can be on their way. In my opinion, enforcing merchant growth conversations with merchants makes it very mechanical and comes off as sale'sy.\n\nThey have one of the lowest pay across almost all the departments in the company, maybe they feel that no one can leave the company, the turn over of staff was so much, you can see about 3 - 5 people leaving in a month, sometimes, even more.

In my experience and for Ireland specifically, the pay falls quite short of what competitors offer, so if you are living in an expensive capital such as Dublin, this may be somewhat offputting. Alternatively, if you are motivated financially then Shopify may not meet your needs despite the benefits I mentioned in the pros section. The same can be said in terms of stock options - there is no stock increase offered after a change in role or as your tenure increases, at least from what I have seen thus far.\r\n\r\nAnother potential con would be the challenges in terms of career opportunities. It can be tricky to move roles internally unless you network and connect with folks beforehand, and even then, there is often a lot of competition.

The collaborative, upbeat, and social atmosphere that formed the core of Shopify's work experience was completely obliterated. Other reviews have mentioned Shopify's low compensation and higher stress relative to other companies. Those discrepancies were acceptable with world class offices/perks, excellent social events, and a wonderfully cooperative atmosphere where you got to sit next to other intelligent, ambitious people everyday. \r\n\r\nWith digital by default, all of those positive aspects were taken away, while the problems remained and became much more visible. The experience became no different from any other high flying tech company, only for (significantly) less pay, literally zero physical interaction with your coworkers, and a stifling, passive aggressive culture where key issues are quickly shut down on internal channels.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen any other company handle COVID the way Shopify did. Shopify employees have to work remotely forever, from a decision that was made without ever consulting them, and to which they never consented to. That speaks volumes. \r\n\r\nIf you're a current Shopify employee who has been there for a year, reflect on why you're still there. Research salaries at other tech companies.

Benefits are amazing. Work from Home role.", "cons": "I'm here about 4 months in the Support Advisor role. I am one of the most senior on my team and get called upon to mentor the newbies. The company is growing rapidly in Ireland and most advisors are moving up to specialised teams quickly. That is a positive for those who move on but for those of us starting out there is very little help in this crazy job. You have to provide support on shipping, billing, taxes, apps, Facebook, Instagram, the Shop app, retail POS hardware, tech issues, SEO, theme issues, design and deliver 'merchant growth' i.e upselling in all those interactions. It's an insane workload and the training is subpar. We had a very large training group lead by a lovely trainer who had the right manner but was totally let down by the curriculum. We spent most of our time reading course after course on feature after feature. One short course on domains and we were supposed to go on live channels and troubleshoot domain issues, same for international sales taxes, Shopify Capital offerings, Facebook integration....Impossible. On weeks 4 and 5 we were introduced to mentors but it was different guys every session, some excellent, some terrible. We were thrown on 3 chats without enough practice and with little support from the mentor, at the end of that session, one member of my group almost walked, and another collected 2 'frownies' from dissatisfied merchants. Talk about demotivating someone! I cannot even blame the merchants, imagine wanting to get help with analytics, domain transfers or customising your site and getting a newbie who is still in training! Even worse when we were put on phones. Only 2 members of my group got a call, another frownie was picked up there and the rest of us were put onto teams with no call training and scheduled for call shifts on week 1.\n\nMy own first solo session on live chats was scheduled for 8am when most of my team were not yet in, and with an average tenure on the team of about 4 months not sure they'd have been any use! Stress isn't the word and so it goes 4 months in. \n\nEvery day I get queries I haven't a clue about. Queries that require specialised training to be able to answer the merchant. We are told to google, navigate help cards and fake it till you make it. We can ask the specialised support teams but each of them has iron clad rules about what we can ask and heaven help you if you ask and they think you should have just googled. Head. Bitten. Off. \n\nTeam leads are nice people, but mine and many others were promoted to leadership after a few months with no management experience. They are pleasant and we get to have 2x monthly hour long team meetings where Shopify gives us some money to buy food, merch etc for the team. But there's just no support. If you say you are totally frazzled, feel undertrained and ill-prepared to give merchants the support they deserve you are sent a flowery article on imposter syndrome and told to....google better when you get a question.\n\nSo, 4 months in, and I love WFH, I'm happy with the salary and the benefits are amazing. This job could be a dream job, I'd love to stay here in rural Ireland working at home without the commute but I'm already at the end of my rope. Have lost 10 pounds, have pounding headaches by the end of the day, and am sick to my stomach when dealing with phone calls from merchants who want advice on analytics and coding and Italian couriers and Swedish taxes and credit card chargebacks and policy documents. Not to mention the ones who want me to guide them through setting up collections and importing from Oberlo and sorting their variants live on the call and get snappy when I'm slow as someone poorly trained and new to the job would be.\n\nLike all call center jobs you also have rude, rude people who yell at you over things you have no control over like credit card transaction fees and delayed mail. Others come in with an attitude, won't do anything you say, and give you a 'frownie' 2 mins after you send them a long email with possible solutions which they clearly did not read or try to implement. \n\nI will probably be gone before Christmas, I'm hanging on to reach my goal of paying off my car loan. I'll miss my lovely coworkers, the benefits, no commute!, and the very cool swag boxes that Shopify sends out. But my body can't hold up under the constant stress much longer. \n\nShopify really needs to consider having specialised teams instead of jack of all trades advisers FKA gurus. At the very least revamp the training. As I type a new bunch of advisors are landing in their teams, I have had them shadowing me this week and they are stunned, scared, stressed, and feel totally unprepared."}], [{"review_title": "Not Available", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Human Resources Sr Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible work, great benefits, and friendly co-workers", "cons": "Lower pay and a lot of uncertainty/move too fast"}, {"review_title": "Awesome", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Senior Staff Developer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pretty new but it's been good so far.
