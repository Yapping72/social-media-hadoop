Consequently, for your average \u201cworker bee\u201d the salaries cannot really be considered to be that great or competitive with our peers any longer.\r\nThere are also a lot of rumors that after the looming  2018 layoffs that salaries and bonuses will still need to be cut to reduce the G&A to the level promised to shareholders by the previous CEO. These rumors were for the most part rooted in the very negative message to employees via INC. (Internal Company Website) by the COB earlier in 2017. \r\n\r\nL.T.I.\u2019s:\r\nIn reality, these actually no longer exist. The multipliers for our PSU\u2019s have been so small  in the past few years that these are inconsequential. \r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nWhen employees say that the Benefits are good, I don\u2019t think they have had to use them since July 1, 2017, as the Benefits were slashed to the bone at that point. We are now at the lowest benefits tier that Sunlife offers and the few benefits we do have, we pay dearly for. \r\n\r\nThe ability to buy vacation with \u201cCenovus Benefit $\u201d is now so expensive that for a lot of employees the purchasing of additional vacation is no longer an option. A few years ago, I was able to purchase 2 weeks\u2019 vacation, the Enhanced Benefits and both Life and Disability insurance and still have some of my \u201cCenovus Benefit $\u2019s \u201d go into my contribution portion of the Company Savings. As of July 1st, 2017 to purchase 2 weeks\u2019 vacation, the barebones Basic Benefits and minimal Life and Disability insurance cost me over $3000.00, so no, the benefits at Cenovus are no longer even close to being good.\r\n\r\nWork/Life Balance:\r\nNot as great as some people would lead you to believe.  Cenovus has a 30 minute longer base workday than most of our peers. The Calgary Cenovus staff are required to put in a minimum of 40 hour/week base + and additional 2.5 hours for our EDO\u2019s for a total of 42.5 hours/week. Whereas our peers at CNRL, Suncor and Husky put in a 37.5 hour/week base + 2.5 hours for their EDO\u2019s for a total of 40 hours/week.\r\n\r\n I think for a lot of the senior professionals, the term \u201cWorklife Balance\u201d should be replaced here at Cenovus by the term \u201cWork/Life Integration\u201d. We have lost so many staff to workforce reductions (3 rounds of layoffs @ 600+ so far, with another 700 looming in early 2018) that the workload for most has increased dramatically; leaving the only way to get it all done is by working from home using the MyVPN connection.\r\n\r\nCenovus traded our 1st and 3rd Fridays (which we worked back 100%) for a summer schedule of Fridays off and an extended Christmas break. I for one still do not like this arrangement. The company said they had to do this to restore faith in the Investment community because the shareholders wanted the employees to suffer along with them. \r\nI think what the Investment community would have preferred is to not have their investment dollars squandered by the Cenovus Executives on the Conoco deal. \r\n\r\nWork Environment/Employee Morale:\r\nThe morale of the average Cenovus employee has suffered irreparable damage. The work environment can be summed up in a single word, depressing\u2026.and getting worse.  This is a direct result of the looming staff reductions of yet another 700 employees. Do not believe for a moment that these additional staff reduction are to be blamed on current commodity pricing, these reductions are a direct result of the crippling/horrible Conoco Deal. What is very disheartening to me is that the previous CEO got to keep his pride in tact by being \u201cRetired Off\u201d with a very lucrative package while making life very stressful and difficult for the average employee. \r\n\r\nI feel shame should be put everyone on the Board and the Executive team that had anything to do with the extirpation of Cenovus, it used to be such a great company."}, {"review_title": "CVE", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 May 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Whether you have a positive or negative experience here depends on your GL and your director.

All of the experience, skilled and educated employees are looking for work elsewhere and if things ever pick up in the oil patch again there will be a massive exodus. Some people are even leaving for other industries and taking lower incomes just to get out of this nightmare. \r\n\r\nThe corporate strategy is to simply recycle the same failed upper and middle management every one to two years in the hope that it will magically fix total incompetence. For example, their engineering group was a disaster in 2014 so they transferred the people in charge of it to other random positions to go make a mess over there. They then put in a new random and unqualified team who then also failed. Now they have a new engineering group leadership team who again have no skills or experience for the job and it is an even bigger disaster than the last two shuffles. The irony is that many of the \u201cnew\u201d engineering leaders where part of the failure in 2014.\r\n\r\nAll sought after jobs are filled in the background using a nepotistic approach where experience, skills, and education are not factored in at all. Past failures of upper and middle management is completely ignored and usually rewarded. If someone in the nepotism circle is not given a new leadership position after a complete failure they are given obscure advisory roles with zero responsibly and accountability. As with the leadership positions these advisory positions are never posted on the company\u2019s internal job board to try and find people with the actual skills, experience and education to fill the created positions. \r\n\r\nWith the recent reorganization that takes place every year or so they literally just filled spots on the org chart with warm bodies. There are very experienced chemical engineers who now have to pretend to be mechanical or reservoir engineers, people with high school education expected to work as engineers etc. Instead of laying off unskilled and uneducated workers and hiring new people out of the huge labour pool in Alberta the company just puts a blindfold on and hope that things will magically work out. \r\n\r\nThe company provides zero technical training and tells employees to develop themselves using internal growth. Yes, they actually think that it is a good idea not to train employees and keep them.

Felt as though management really cared about my well-being and although it was a big company, it had a small company feel to it. They fostered a positive culture, and they did a great job creating a \"family\" atmosphere in the workplace. This all changed when the downturn hit.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I fully appreciate cutbacks are necessary in fiscally challenging times. In saying that, Cenovus Energy has undoubtedly handled the downturn most poorly relative to it's peers. I'd empower whomever reads this review to look-up peers to Cenovus (ex. Suncor, CNRL, MEG etc.) on glassdoor.ca and note their scores as evidence of this claim. I'll provide specific examples of this below.\r\n\r\nBonuses - from the time when I first started to now, there has been a movement for employee's bonuses to be paid out more based on personal performance versus company performance. Conversely, management/executive bonus compensation was transitioned to be based more on company performance versus personal performance. Typically, from conversations with several peers spanning multiples teams, it was a rare occurrence for an individual's personal score to be greater than the company score if they weren't a part of the management structure. With this in mind, when these changes were implemented, it was asked if this change was a \"cost-cutting measure\" to which the executive team replied that the monetary amount to be paid out on bonuses actually increased because of the change. Since it was rare for employee's personal scores to exceed the company score this would intuitively mean that management/executive bonuses increased while employee bonuses decreased. \r\n\r\nSalary - when the downturn hit, it was emphasized to the workforce that salaries would not be reduced resulting in Cenovus opting to cut staff instead. Like the above example, this left a lot of staff with the underlying feeling that this was because the executive/management (who made this decision) did not want to take cuts to their own salaries and would be willing to sacrifice staff to ensure their compensation remained intact. From talking to many of my fellow employees, we felt as though methods implemented by peers such as CNRL that involved tiered salary cuts were a self-less and admirable act implemented by the executive as it resulted in the executive/management having their salaries increased by the most. From talking to colleagues from CNRL on this, although this cut resulted in reduced compensation, it actually resulted in solidifying the workforce and instilling a feeling that everyone a part of that organization was in it together. Mr. Ferguson went on BNN and said it was \"gut-wrenching\" to lay people off and permanently alter their way of life, yet when faced with the decision to implement a similar tiered salary cut done by CNRL that involved cutting higher earner's salaries the most, he and his team opted to proceed with layoffs."}, {"review_title": "A laid back culture with good people, slowing going downhill due to HP", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jul 2012", "job_title": " in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Friendly culture\r\n-Not deadline oriented\r\n-Good work/life balance\r\n-Light on bureaucracy / excessive paperwork", "cons": "-Promotions due to tenure rather than merit result in subpar leadership\r\n-IT attempting to save money by using HP is resulting in poor responsiveness to business demands\r\n-'Old oil' culture of controlling information flow, opaque management decisions"}, {"review_title": "Hands on company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Safety Advisor in Conklin, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Middle management was fairly integrated and involved in day to day operations.

The poor choices in management and executive level promotions accelerated the poor results as the company chased the wrong things.   When results were not delivered, there wasn't a culture of accountability to address the issues.

Finance has split roles apart creating workflows that make no sense and work is not allocated evenly with some people being totally abused and some people under utilized or with nothing to do or they don't understand what they are supposed to be doing.

The structure of so many of the roles doesn't make sense but people would be stupid to say anything for fear of being laid off or targeted by senior management and people who are overworked to the point of nervous breakdown can't say anything for fear of being labelled as having a bad attitude. You have people doing things twice or pushing work off on others and saying it is not their responsibility. Either way it is a mess. You can't say on one hand to be motivated and innovative and on the other hand completely ignore employee opinions and treat them like children and push them around. A company is only as good as its people and its people are only as good as their desire to work hard for the company. And here is the biggest problem. The senior leaders are bullies and skilled buzzword users and politicians. And they must be telling the Executive what they want to hear and the Executive must be eating it up with their head in the sand.  Finance senior managers are skilled at standing in front of a room and saying bogus things like \"we have an open door policy\" or \"lets use straight talk\" or \"we should support each other\". They are manipulators and excellent at office politics. How they actually behave is the exact opposite of what they say. If anyone says anything they don't want to hear then that person is labelled and sabotaged and certainly will get bad bonuses and no promotions ever. Senior management is famous for saying that if people step up for Cenovus and work hard through busy times by working their Friday off and then the Saturday and then the Sunday that they are only entitled to the Friday off because professional accountants should be expected to work weekends. That is just short-sighted bully bad management. Plain and simple. We are not talking about times when surprises come up that have to be dealt with. We are talking about repeated expectations from bully managers forcing people to meet unrealistic deadlines that are set knowing full well that overtime will be needed to achieve them. That is bad management and isn't progressive or motivating. A motivated and respected person can get more done in 6 hours than a disgruntled person gets done in a week and thats a fact. What they should be asking is:  What will produce a motivated workforce?  What will produce people who continue to be willing to go above and beyond? Will it harm Cenovus to give the person time in lue for the time they are away from their family at another slow time when the impact is zero? The senior management at Cenovus are the dictionary definition of bullies who have pounded the will out of their workforce to the point that everyone hates it here. They should know that almost nobody is happy. So many people are talking about leaving when the market picks up. Senior Financial Analysis leadership only like other buzzword users because they don't challenge. Cenovus why do you think the reorg doesn't make sense? Answer: you put senior leaders in charge that hate feedback and details. The senior leadership is known for giving vague instructions and letting the team figure out the direction and if things work they take the credit and if problems happen they throws people under the bus. And don't even try to discuss a detail because the senior leadership will belittle you and be condescending and will bully you until you leave an figure it out for yourself. The senior leadership is just interested in saying how progressive it is to combine operations, planners, finance people all together to make this amazing new way of doing things that is apparently innovative. When in actuality it is nonsense and inefficient. But the problem is that upper management are never the people to suffer when they make really bad decisions. It is the front line people that suffer as they are bullied into making something work that is ridiculous. Cenovus has really good front line people, group leads, and managers.  After that the personalities of the senior leaders are the problem. No matter how much you instruct a bully to be a progressive manager they will never ever get it. They don't understand how true leaders inspire through example and respect. They only understand how to get results by pushing others around and they only appreciate other bullies because they understand them. Cenovus has some excellent managers in Finance.  All of them are respected and they strike the right balance between being aware enough of the details to be effective while at the same time empowering their teams to achieve and complete the work. Most of them would be better choices to lead Finance than what Cenovus has now. And Cenovus has so many excellent front line workers and group leads who are carrying this company right now.  The executive needs to understand how completely demotivated people have become after years of working for bullies and enduring countless reorgs with each one being worse and making less sense than the last one. People will get behind change when it makes sense but not to give a VP a big bonus for something that is changed the following year because it never made sense."}, {"review_title": "Embarrassed to talk about the company", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "25 Jun 2016", "job_title": "Plant Operator in Conklin, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Base pay is about on par with other companies \r\nCo-workers, but all the well qualified and valuable ones will be leaving at first chance because Cenovus has shown it's true colors.", "cons": "Hacked our benefits plan when it was already sub par to begin with.\r\nCut camp pay back\r\nCut all flights except Calgary and Edmonton \r\nEveryone in the field sites is absolutely disappointed, angry, upset, in dis-belief of everything they are doing to mess with our lives after they promised and preached they want to have an excellent work/life balanced culture. \r\nThey are cutting field positions that are still absolutely needed, increasing workload for other workers, increasing stress and fatigue.\r\nNot one single person on site will tell you they are proud to work for Cenovus, I can guarantee you that.....not one. 3 years ago it would be hard to find 1 person that wasn't proud.

By the time the rest of the organization has caught up, the structure or direction of the company has changed again.\r\nThere is a lack of rigour in the decision making process.  The oil and gas business is a cyclical business subject to commodity volatility.  The only way to be competitive is to plan on oil ranging in price from $100/bbl to $25/bbl and build cost effective efficient operating plants with a 40 year life cycle.  Building facilities based on an 80/20 rule and only paying attention to capital cost and schedule means that you have to spend a lot of money to keep the assets running.  This hits you hardest when the commodity price drops.\r\nSafety isn't something that just happens because you tell your employees and contractors to work safely.  You have to lead by example and show how you want things to be operated safely.  This includes safety in design from day 1 to demolition of the asset.  Safety isn't just slips, trips and falls and wearing PPE.\r\nAnd as highlighted in other reviews, it is an old boys club.
