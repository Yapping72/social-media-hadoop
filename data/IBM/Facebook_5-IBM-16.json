These guys run the operation by making everyone submit all the work they do every day by typing out a word document. The shift leads are then required to go through it and tell you everything you did wrong. If there is more than a 15-minute gap, you will be asked about it. No matter how hard you try, there is always something wrong and trust me I tried for years too look at this process with a growth mindset. Instead of actually doing work, a lot of time is spent covering your back. \r\n\r\nManagement holds monthly meetings where the shift leads are required to give up one of their team members as \u201clow-performing,\u201d whether it\u2019s true or not. In other words, senior management believes it\u2019s I\u2019m possible to have a team where all team members are good workers, and so they make the shift leads call out a member of the team as low-performing each month. They also are required to tell management about a team member that is excelling at work. The shift leads are then expected to provide feedback and corrective actions to the low performer and nothing happens for the over-achiever\u2014not even positive feedback. The meeting is literally just created to paint the narrative that everything wrong is because of a few technicians. The morale has been low for years and confidence in management has been just the same.\r\n\r\nManagement plays favorites and if you suck up enough you won\u2019t have any issues. If you try to innovate you will get ideas stolen and other team mates and managers WILL try to take credit for it. It\u2019s the most unreal and unprofessional environment I\u2019ve ever worked at. I was heavily advised by a couple of supervisors and senior technicians during my first year at the company to get promoted to another department as soon as possible because this department is terrible, but I just thought those colleagues were childish and didn\u2019t have a growth mindset. It turns out that I just didn\u2019t see all the wrongdoings at the company early on. Despite putting in years of effort, innovation i offered which was inspired by years of operational EXPERIENCE at other companies just couldn\u2019t compete with the ideas upper management got after reading dollar-store management books. Those supervisors and technicians that told me to change roles/get promoted to another department in my first year of employment were right. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is nothing to be gained for an over-achiever who aims to make a career at this company in the Datacenter Technician role. Another big part of the reason for this is nepotism. There are way too many family members and friends from high school in upper management... there needs to be an investigation into this. \r\n\r\nI have brought up many issues to HR at IBM Cloud but their HR is a joke. \r\n\r\nEfficiency is not a word that\u2019s used very often at the company.\r\n\r\nThis place is a joke."}, {"review_title": "Good company, but hard to get promotions and grow", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Project Manager in San Jose, San Jose", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work from home, no Micro Management, Office is nice", "cons": "During pandemic no equipment was sent to use home such as monitors, no salary adjustments/promotions and hard to move to other positions"}, {"review_title": "Great People", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "10 May 2021", "job_title": "Digital Sales Representative in Armonk, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "coworkers, managers, great atmosphere, benefits", "cons": "difficult to compete, slow to respond to current buying atmosphere"}], [{"review_title": "Good income, large scale projects, mainframe exposure", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Poughkeepsie, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly atmosphere and exposure to mainframe technology", "cons": "High levels of micromanagement of projects with overlapping interest from many teams with different expertise and needs can lead to a lot more time in meetings revisiting project direction from multiple teams instead of focusing on Agile products to deliver."}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 May 2021", "job_title": "Enterprise Architect in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work flexibility, opportunity for growth and work culture", "cons": "Big company, slow to respond, and internal politics"}, {"review_title": "Great worklife balance", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 May 2021", "job_title": "Data Specialist in Gurgaon, Haryana", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work life balance. positive atmosphere.", "cons": "No Cons as such.

Hopefully, they fixed this by now.\r\n- Taking vacations will lower your utilization rate, so even if you have time to take off, don't if you're close to the borderline where you get fired\r\n- There were several phases of layoffs, particularly the newly hired, which was incredibly unlucky for those who didn't get a chance to have any project experience (I believe this got rectified because IBM over hired college students)\r\n- Getting fired was very easy; heard about co-workers who were in the wrong place at the wrong time with little to no heads up\r\n- Getting the right manager was uncommon as the good ones always left IBM quickly, so chances are you are going to get a manager that pushes you around, throws you under the bus, and asks you to work weekends/late nights with no heads up. If you get one of the good ones, they are fantastic. \r\n- There is definitely an IBM character: focused on work, no time for hobbies (unless it is exercise), comes off cold, enjoys networking, family comes second, enjoys talking about what status they have in each airline/hotel chain.
