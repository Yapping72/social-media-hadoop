There are times when things are hot and when they are pretty cool. In all, I will rank them high in this area.\n- In my experience, I had access to all kinds of learning resources. Self development is a big deal it appears. I had access to all kinds of materials from text books, to articles, to lectures, etc through the IBM learning portal. Oh boy did i milk that thing!\n- I had the opportunity of working various kinds of projects which also helped so much in my professional development. \n- I had the opportunity of trying out new devops application and practices because there is preponderance of hardware resources that enabled me to do this. (Mind you, this may not be the case for everybody). My position (systems engineer, gave me access to a lot of compute resources and placed me at the frontline of problems.\n- The company also paid for all my education expenses that saw me obtain my master degree (I don't know if they still do this)\n- A lot of solid, old technology talents - They may have problems with doing things the new way though (I mean driving Infrastructure as code, self healing automation etc)", "cons": "- The chain of commands can make it difficult to innovate. I had to push and pull to drive change (more importantly though, your direct manager is very important here. My manager was not the best at advocating for her workers).\n- The pay can also be very low (I got a little over double the amount I made while in IBM as an advisory Engineer when I transitioned to another company). For the last three years of my total 8, I was without pay raise.\n- They are also beginning to go in the direction of other 'woke' corporate cultures across the US by driving \"diversity and inclusion\" to its insane end. They have adopted the CRT training in their learning modules basically attempting to brainwash members of staff along the 'woke' thought-process.\n- The performance criteria and measurement are very nebulous and quite difficult to navigate (for me, your experience may be different)."}, {"review_title": "Good company to work for", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Lead Recruiter in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- I was lucky to work within a great and supportive team, made friends for life\n- good benefits\n- generous maternity cover\n- medical leave fully paid for half a year\n- choice of laptops- amongst Mac or Lenovo \n- great learning platform, badges\n- working from home", "cons": "- salary inequality amongst people working in the same team\n- lack of transparency on career progression\n- redundancies every few years\n- acquisition of promising companies and then destroying their culture, teams, everything that made them successful"}, {"review_title": "Great Place to Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Senior Consultant in Columbus, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Many personal and professional resources\r\n- Clear job description and responsibilities \r\n- Ability to change/move roles and learn new skills\r\n- Room for growth\r\n- Being a thought leader is encouraged", "cons": "- Large company, can be difficult to manage at first\r\n- Goals and corporate changes happen freqeuntly\r\n- Very busy work-days"}], [{"review_title": "Wonderful company to start your career", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Network Support Specialist in Markham, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Wonderful company to start your career \r\n- Lot of focus and resources for skill development\r\n- Management is very good and understanding", "cons": "Less pay as compare to market\r\nGrowth/promotions not easy"}, {"review_title": "Unfair opportunities", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 May 2022", "job_title": "Team Leader in Cairo, Cairo Governorate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company \nYou can learn a lot", "cons": "Managers are unfair and disrespectful"}, {"review_title": "Toxic Environment- No action taken against Bullying", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Sales in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice offices \r\nGood canteen\r\nGood benefits package", "cons": "Too much data in too many places\r\nHard to navigate\r\nTLA's the norm - its a different language\r\nToxic environment\r\nHR Weak and on the side of management- if you have an issue with workplace bullying dont even bother raising it - you will be outcast and managed out"}, {"review_title": "Work environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Deputy Manager in Chandigarh", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Equal opportunity for all employees", "cons": "It is a work heavy environment, I saw little stress on employee engagement"}, {"review_title": "Great, long lasting, always renewed experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "17 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Digital Sales Manager in Bois-Colombes", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Technology company focussing on client transformation and success, always adjusting strategy to clients expectations and matters, making work always interesting.", "cons": "regular internal transformation is happening fast"}, {"review_title": "Boys club", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Technical Architect in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Cash awards every quarter for significant project contribution", "cons": "Below average Payroll and HR services - they can't even be bothered to do an in person exit interview.

Communication is difficult and often obscured when trying to develop internally within IBM. Perhaps due to Data Center Operations being physically separate (and sometimes temporally) from other teams, and IBM Cloud being a separate \"child company\" acquired and in a continuous state of integration into IBM.\r\nBased on the last couple years, full-time hires are decreasing in favor of contract workers without benefits. IBM should offer full-time employment on completion of training, but this could also change.\r\nNew hires are usually stuck on evening or night shift once training has progressed enough (1-2 months), moving off this will again depend on how well you communicate with management, or it may get you moved to a different DC site.\r\nYou are responsible for the office environment and equipment maintenance. If you and your coworkers don't stay on top of it, expect tools to degrade. You will have to be your own IT, while also dealing with IBM remote help desk (my experiences with them have been poor, regardless of the time of day I called in)."}, {"review_title": "SAP Senior Consultant", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Package Solution Consultant in Calcutta", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Many which no other company has.\r\n1- Learning\r\n2-Upskilling\r\n3-Working Environment\r\n4- Most advance technology\r\n5- Integrity, Respect, Dignity.", "cons": "No such Cons, I found till now"}, {"review_title": "Salary", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "11 Apr 2022", "job_title": "SSE- Development in Calcutta", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good work culture with benefits", "cons": "Salary increment is very slow"}, {"review_title": "Good company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Project Manager in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "IBM is a very good company", "cons": "Promotion can be little slow"}, {"review_title": "No work satisfaction", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Advisory Systems Analyst in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Bluepoints, training and joining bonus", "cons": "No career growth \r\nAnnual hike\r\nManagement is not good"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good environment. good good good", "cons": "Poor growth potential.
