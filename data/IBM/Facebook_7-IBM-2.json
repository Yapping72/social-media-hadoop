It\u2019s a cult environment and if you don\u2019t have a specific clique or don\u2019t kiss behind, you\u2019ll never make it. When you start they will tell you it\u2019s an \u201copen door policy\u201d work place and that it\u2019s okay to share your concerns with your peers, well that was a lie. Your salary is super low! I finished the apprenticeship at $42,500 and when switched over to a band 6g(associate) I never received a raise. Mangers hate talking about raises too! I was at 42,500 for almost two years and got a not to so great end of the year review in 2022, despite me doing everything in the gbs progression chart for a raise to band 7a! The center and managers do what they want to keep your salary low. It\u2019ll take you 3-4 years to get to $55,000 when the Monroe center starts at $55,000. Cost of living is higher in Baton Rouge. The people who work at the center as associates can barely afford to pay for rent anywhere in a safe neighborhood in Baton Rouge.  I have ADHD, anxiety and depression and was put on a PIP to \u201cgive me structure\u201d, mind you I never agreed or signed this PIP.  July I was fired because of non completion of the PIP but on May 26 my managers congratulated me for completing the PIP and the evidence of completion was posted in a box folder for my managers and Delivery Managers to see. There needs to be more management, disability, and diversity training. In June there was a new hire, she was my onboard buddy I was assigned, well little did I know she was replacing my spot on the team lol. My two years at IBM I had over 1,500 learning hours, I knew my role as a data engineer but my managers failed me. How can I be a data Engineer but my managers are project managers that have only used sql or no technical languages at all\ud83e\udee4.  I created training for my team so that we learn together, I participated in hackathons on behalf of IBM, I participated in service corps twice! \r\nDuring Hurricane Ida last year, I was homeless for 2 weeks! But I was still expected to show up for work and keep in touch with my client for the project I was on, I had no basic needs to even focus on my project.  If your neurodiverse please reach out to someone in HR- not BR HR and get accommodations. My managers joked about about me having adhd in my checkpoint goals. When I asked my manager about reasonable accommodations her response was \u201cidk anything reasonable accommodations\u201d. Also, if you\u2019re traveling please get your manager to help you to expense your charges. I asked my managers over 10 times and they never helped me to expense. This was my first corporate job and we were never shown how to expense our credit card charges. I now I have an Amex bill for $3k because I traveled for IBM for a client project and no one helped me to expense it. Also, the apprenticeship is a waste of time, it\u2019s just a way for IBM CIC to get FREE or CHEAP labor, because they don\u2019t teach you anything technical while in the apprenticeship!  You have to fight to learn yourself. IBM CIC is backwards and I wouldn\u2019t send my dog to them. Before I was terminated my manager asked me to resign. I was told by my manager that I would get 4 weeks pay, benefits, vacation days and sick days paid out(110 hours), he told me \u201cI don\u2019t write checks I can\u2019t cash\u201d apparently the check bounced. The next week I went on vacation because I had not had an actual vacation since December 2020. My first vacation in July 2022 really made everyone upset. When I came back from vacation my managers had a problem with every single thing I was doing. I spoke with my therapist and she asked me to take a FMLA mental health leave so I did, because the CIC had me in a dark place. I told my managers and she was upset and had an attitude, so I told her I would cancel my leave. My manager responded and told me to get documentation from my doctor that I was able to return to work. The next day, the first day of FMLA leave(because I hadn\u2019t canceled yet, due to me getting a doctors note) I was fired due to \u201cnon-completion of PIP) which is a lie because I have documentation of every conversation held between my managers and I. Worst of all, when I was terminated my manager said I would get 4 weeks pay and package. By Friday of that week my benefits had been canceled and my final paycheck was July 15. I was given a payment for vacation but they cut me short I received $300, which doesn\u2019t add up because I had 15 vacation days, I only used 5 days of vacation. I was never paid for the 10 unused days. Also, stop sending associates into the office when it not necessary! Just to say you have bodies in the building. Stop using your people as goods and trades! Jesus Christ. There is so much more I can go on about but I've typed the gist of things. \r\n\r\nPlease stay away from this center! Please! It\u2019s not good for anyones health unless you\u2019re a white male! I don\u2019t ever want anyone to experience what I did. I was gaslighted and put on a strict military type work flow, micromanaged and targeted. My mental health went from cheery to having second guests about my life. I was mentally beaten even after being a top performer. This center doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re in your death bed, please stay away. This is my truth and I don't want anyone to go through it.
