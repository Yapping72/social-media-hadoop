There is so much opportunity to learn in this company, and in general, the willingness of senior technical leaders to teach (and of managers to support such education) is remarkable.  Although organizational politics will sometimes create barriers, the potential of this large, talented organization can be incredible when focused & engaged on a goal.  IBM also seems to be one of the leading firms in terms of \"walking the talk\" on work life balance.  While extensive use of work/life integration tools may be seen by some as stepping off the career fast-track, it is widely used, and the level of flexibility in many divisions/organizations is quite high compared to peer firms.", "cons": "Bureaucracy is incredibly high.

A bloated, bureaucratic management structure weighs down the whole organization, so innovation comes slowly and way behind most of the marketplace.  All aspects of work at IBM are process-driven, so expect mountains of rules and documentation that frequently confound common sense.\r\n\r\nProbably the worst thing about IBM is the employee rating system.  You are assigned your rating in a group meeting with all first and second line managers, and there is literally no objective criteria built in to the process.  To be rated well, you must be very good at managing relationships with your manager and his\r\npeers.  The people who thrive are frequently not the top contributors, but the ones who self-promote and manage perceptions well.  IBM enforces a brutal ratings curve on the first and second line managers, so if you are not the leader of the pack, do not expect raises or promotions.

It is very difficult to know who is your HR partner. your manager is god in IBM. Your growth depends on your manager. \r\n4) If you manager is not good, your growth is stalled. there are so many things in the hands of manger.  so in nutshell, only one person is shaping your career with IBM. If he decide, he wont give you increments, bonus, wont approve leaves, wont let you work from home, wont approve your trainings and certifications etc. \r\n5) Low increments. Less bonus. \r\n6) Work environment is very boring. There are no team building activities.

The program includes guidance and interaction with people from varying branches of the company.  Early on, a social culture with an emphasis on networking, teamwork, and problem solving was established.  In the first learning lab, we were pushed to make a series of mock sales calls.  We received constructive feedback from the sales advisors and our peers and then proceeded to watch and critique our fellow trainees as they made calls.  It was one of the most productive learning exercises that I have ever been a part of... and I used to be a teacher.  This company offers a wide range of opportunities in a variety of areas.  I came in with an open mind and willingness to learn.  It is a great place to be if you are open to constantly learning and adapting.", "cons": "It is a very self-paced program.

Growth is limited - if they like your work, they try to give you regular hikes to keep you happy. If you don't have a God Father here, then growth in role and responsibilities can be forgotten. Year after year you will continue to work on several low budget projects whereas your Manager's yes-man will get just one big budget project. \r\nLeaders do not lead by example, lack courage and are busy micro-managing, firefighting and pleasing their GEO counterparts just so they get a good recommendation at the end of appraisal year. \r\nWhereas Managers are soft on GEO and hard on their own teams. They only want authority with zero accountability. \r\nAttrition is high but they don't care to arrest it. Hiring happens all year round. Selection of candidates is highly questionable as many can barely write a sentence using correct English. Getting work done on projects becomes a nightmare due to poor communication. Most Managers too refrain from writing emails knowing they'll be exposed. Most of them do their work over the phone or in person. This way nothing is documented and they have a clear escape route.\r\nCoordinating with Transport guys is a daily head ache. Appraisal system is unfair, one sided.

A lot of looking over your shoulder if you're not connected to some one in mgmt. More emphasis on what your \"special project\" looks like on paper and not what you do day to day. In tens years, ten managers only one who provided and sort of support or guidance. Very stressful once you know the score. Not loyalty anywhere and to anyone. Purely dog eat dog.
