And most of them have survived 10+ years in IBM to become an IBM Manager. They have forgotten even how to behave with the new senior resources.\n6) Recommending something, and asking support to the management - is backfiring. You will get only blame in return than support.

First change the old school lower management - when you are bringing new resources under them. The lower management folks are 10 to 20 years sitting on the same position and role and frustrated - how could you expect the new skilled experienced higher paid resources will be treated well?\n8) Switching a project is tough - if you are performing very well.

Everyone is doing certification on the technologies in reality - that has nothing to do with their daily job.\n10) IBM works on theory than Reality.\n11) We were once the most advanced futuristic company.
