AS you and your company applicastions will be sun-setted into the wild BLUE Yonder!!!!"}, {"review_title": "From Great  to Good to Average to ....", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Apr 2011", "job_title": "IT Architect in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My experience is specific to IBM Global Business Services in Canada and I can not speak to other divisions of IBM. \r\n\r\nLet me start by saying that IBM and IBM management over the years have been great to me.

At my time of employment stock awards were suspended as a means of rewarding our best employees leaving managers with little to work with other than a shrinking bonus pool to offer top employees.  Often the result would be essentially telling the employee that despite the business unit doing well their reward for performance would simply be continued employment (this was something experienced prior to the recession).\r\n\r\nFinancial pressures on IBM due to the cost of health care also had an effect on the total compensation package.  With each year available healthcare plans changed resulting in often having to switch doctors, higher deductibles and less coverage.  While the overall coverage offered was still generally better than many other companies, it became a challenge to manage the yearly changes required of moving to a new health care provider's network (transfer of records, finding new doctors in my area, ensuring I had the right coverage for my family, etc...).  More than once I had to battle the company bureaucracy to pay for federally mandated coverage.\r\n\r\nWork-life balance became a work-life blend.  While policies like telecommuting were in place at the end of my tenure at IBM, executives were actively redefining what work-life meant at IBM.  The end result was more of a blending of work and life rather than maintaining any separation.  The option to telecommute became more restrictive with the building of a new campus and an expectation of being connected to work, even when on paid time off, became the norm.  \r\n\r\nAs a mature and large company IBM is process driven to a fault.  Innovation and creativity are stifled leading IBM to often fail in recognizing a business opportunity or industry trend (need an example? then consider their delayed entry to cloud computing)."}, {"review_title": "Great way to start my career, limited prospects for growth", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "13 Oct 2014", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Rochester, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I started working at IBM as an intern in 2005 and left in 2010, at the time (and I imagine it is still this way), the company was in a transition with a lot of long time employees and a transition to workers overseas.\r\n\r\nMy favorite part about working at IBM was the people.

Leadership after Sam Palmisano stepped down has been myopic, haphazard and, dare I say, incompetent.  Although IBM continues to invest wisely in its technology, it continues to make horrific decisions when bringing that great technology to the marketplace.   Marketing is vague and esoteric.  I have yet to meet a client that understands how \u201cSmarter [insert anything]\u201d relates to solving their business problems\u2026and I deal primarily with C levels and Directors at Fortune companies.  More disturbing are the cavalier decisions IBM makes with its sales force.  Decisions since Palmisano\u2019s exit seem to be more focused on cost containment than revenue growth.   Here are a few examples. \r\n\r\nIBM forces its sales staff to work from home.  That\u2019s understandable as many companies are wisely downsizing their physical infrastructures.  However, IBM stopped paying for the expenses of those employees like business internet and telephone.  \r\n\r\nIBM recently cut the base pay of most pre-sales staff by 5%-13% by shifting the on target earnings mix to incentive.  The result is that pre-sales staff are now paid below market and many of the best, including myself, have already left.\r\nIBM has a history of delaying raises to top performers.  In the six years I\u2019ve been with IBM, I\u2019ve been a top performer (top 10%) for five of them and have received two raises\u2026one for 0.7% and another for 1.1%.  On par performers received nothing.\r\n\r\nIBM has gone through numerous territory reorgs.  Most reps have had their territories changed 100% at least once and sometimes twice per year.  There is little motivation to build a pipeline and any pipeline that is built is a result of client initiated add-ons or RFP\u2019s.  The result is top performers leave and bottom performers are tolerated.  It\u2019s an atmosphere of mediocrity and a great place to hide if you\u2019re a slacker.\r\n\r\nBureaucracy at IBM is rampant.  The layers of management go on forever and each layer wants their unique report, call, meeting, etc.  Also, the PHD influence has created a growing plethora of mandatory education and everything is referred to by a complex three letter acronym.  Each year the red tape grows and IBM sellers become more and more focused on the needs of management vs. selling.  There is truth to the rumor that IBM is run by Accountants and Lawyers.\r\n\r\nIn January of 2014, IBM sellers were required to attend a four day kickoff that ended mid-day on Superbowl Sunday.  The event required them to share rooms and eat snack foods for dinner.  All IBMers were informed they would be tracked via an RFID tag hidden in their badges and lack of attendance would have consequences.  Even more disappointing was the poor and repetitive content that appeared to be slapped together in a very short time frame.  What was supposed to be a motivational event had the opposite effect.

Been here two years now.  GBS NA - New York City based. \r\n\r\nIBM is such a huge company, and there really are so many opportunities here. I have constantly heard this phrase \"IBM is what you make of it.\" While there is some truth, I do not entirely agree. Your experience at IBM really relies on luck and timing. I like to think of myself as a go-getter, ambitious and always learning new things in order to get to the next opportunity, but just being a good employee, working hard and following all the rules is no guarantee here. I have been extremely lucky in my timing in rolling off projects,  in knowing people at the right time, and have been able to take on a lot of responsibility and leadership roles. But peers who I consider good friends as well as excellent and smart coworkers have not had such luck, and it is definitely not because they didn't try hard enough. Some have even been fired after being over 100% client billable with excellent project reviews. So all I can say is - IBM does have the ability to offer you a great experience, just don't always expect it. And if you get unlucky with your IBM experience, it really isn't you, it's them. Other positives: IBM is great to have on a resume even still, exit opportunities are, for the most part, great. Only recommendation for CbDer joining, do your best to learn as many skills as possible while you're here and network as much as possible, that's what's going to get you places.", "cons": "I said most above, just a few things to point out due to my personal experience:\r\n- salary: The salary they give you is based how good your university is. This discrepancy is pretty big and doesn't make sense, the hires from the Ivy league universities are not doing any more work than hires from other colleges. It is really demoralizing.\r\n- management: I have yet to have a single CbD manager or BPM that actually knew what they were doing or has helped me in any way. They don't receive training to manage people, especially those who do need guidance coming into their first job out of college, and the managers who are chosen do not actually want to be managers, they were forced to. IBM needs to invest in their people a lot more, get real managers, get them training, allow for these young people to be mentored and to grow. \r\n- quality of hires: Some of the people I have worked with here are amazing, very intelligent, and have even become close friends. The problem is that so many people here I wonder how they even passed the first screening. The quality of employee differs so greatly, and is not something I would expect from a company that is supposed to be somewhat selective. I have also seen way too many people get in because they are friends with management. I know that this happens, but at IBM this seems to be abused even more. Please hire based off of merit, not on school background or ties to current management.\r\n- such variance in experience: Like I said, there is no one \"IBM experience.\" While I do think it is good for people to have a variety of options and experiences, the variance is much too wide in terms of positive or negative experience. Don't be fooled by the common \"it is what you make of it,\" count your blessings if you have it good."}, {"review_title": "Great Experience - Expect to be Just another Asset", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Cyber Security Analyst in Armonk, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Looks great on your resume.\r\nExtensive experience.\r\nBenefits are great.", "cons": "Extensive experience, in your very narrow job function.\r\nno ability for vertical movement.\r\nFavoritism exists.\r\nPay is low.\r\nCulture and fit are not that great."}, {"review_title": "Worked on two teams, had two very different experiences.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Jul 2018", "job_title": "Advisory Engineer in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Mobility within the company, and the culture to encourages it.

This director was eventually shutdown, but only after years of bad behavior.\r\n- Second team was frequently moving from project to project, and not linked to efforts that brought a lot of value.

Immense scope to participate in technical forums/fora. IBM is part of nearly every technological iniative on earth and hence, any employee is bound to find something or the other that caters to their taste and skill.\r\n2. Investment in nearly every facet of the IT business. IBM is into services, hardware, systems software and application software development. There are various teams where one could find an interesting career.\r\n3. Fairly open with diverse mentor-mentee relationships. IBM encourages people to find mentors to help them guide them along their career. Given that there are people who are leading the technology innovation there is always scope to find someone to inspire and guide you along.", "cons": "The downside is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Poor management. Most of management focuses only on delivery and are not interested in employee development. Anything that is not related to the deadline around the corner is irrelevant and harms delivery. Though it is vital to focus on delivery, managment doesn't recognise the importance of long term growth and totally lack a vision. Management would love to claim that their teams achieved tonnes of things but only the team members know how much they had to suffer for that. Managers prefer all of the non-delivery stuff to be done in employee's personal time.\r\n2. Very stingy. IBM is extremely stingy as far as benefits and other facilities are concerned. Even if someone has come up with a wonderful paper and wish to present it elsewhere, they will whine and cite budget constraints thereby discouraging employees. They will pack people in the minimal quality hotel and not pay much per diem for trips abroad. They make every rupee coming out seem like it has been begged for. Anything which is not for delivery has to be paid out of employee's pockets. \r\n3. Process. IBM only believes in process and in that process they make everything so circuitous that employee would rather suffer in silence than make use of the facilities (which are genuinely inaccessible). Simplest example would be the leave processing system. One needs to raise a request in a database which goes off to some other country and a few days later a form arrives (if at all) which needs to be filled and submitted to the manager. He will then approve it and finally you have your leave granted. In countries like India and China, procuring anything is a nightmare as the number of forms to be filled and the number of people who have to say \"yes\" keeps growing.\r\n4. A lot is only on paper. This is actually a mix of management and process issues. A lot of the so-called facilities are only available on paper. If one tries to realise them, then they are made so difficult to achieve that one loses motivation pretty much immediately.\r\n5. Hiring. IBM focuses a lot on simply meeting headcounts (number of employees are refered to as headcount). They do not even care to ensure that a particular person is good enough or not and whether it makes sense to have in a good team where the team dynamics can get affected.\r\n6. Mindset. IBM still ives in the mainframe mindset. They only know how to make things utterly complicated and messy. Nothing is simple at IBM. Even the tools and software that we are forced to use are arduous and unimaginably stupid. All of us keep wondering who designed them. Many sotware engineers would raise objections which will be dissolved in the numerous process and higher management decisions. Eventually everyone starts thinking along these complicated lines. They can make anything messy. Even when they adopt something from the global software community, they have to change it to suit IBM's god-knows-what-policy and then what comes out is an extremely messy and convoluted approach to the same thing."}, {"review_title": "Great place to make a career.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Aug 2008", "job_title": "Software Engineer in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Many opportunities to move up in the company.

It is fair to say that you spend about 50% of your time collecting the data for and providing it to these systems. Thus, it is not possible to achieve the goals because you are spending most of your time measuring, but not making, progress. \r\n\r\nWhat matters most is to appear to make progress and appear to take responsibility. Over time, your colleagues become disembodied voices in faraway lands, and you spend a great deal of time in conference calls with them. What you quickly learn is that you can declare progress has been made, and no one is likely to know or care whether it was. I inherited, from IBMers who understood how the game is played, projects that recent college graduates would have done a better job of. I was appalled by the \"work\" of senior people.  Thus, IBM is not a place to learn any skill other than that of self promotion.  \r\n\r\nThe cumulative impact is devastating. You don't see as much of the colleagues who are still around because you are always on the phone or trying (in vain) to get something done. The isolation gets to you. You become surprised that someone you worked with for years has a) left without saying anything or b) is still around because you haven't seen them in months. Most people work at home as much as possible.\r\n\r\nBefore IBM came into your life, you knew what a good job was and you knew how to do it. If you stay too long, you begin to doubt that you know anything and are worth anything to another company and even to yourself.

In the time I have been there they phased out free sodas, then free coffee, then paid coffee in break rooms, then water coolers. We do still have running water in the sinks, though. Cafeteria food is extremely high priced. There are no office supplies. Another major gripe is the 401K matching. They moved the date of matching to late December.

And indeed, some of the higher-performing employees have moved on to greener pastures.  Leaving the middle behind.\r\n-There is very little trust, in either direction, between management and employees.  Management has repeatedly shown themselves to be interested in nothing other than the EPS roadmap.  Of course, that is what they are measured by, so it is a classic case of \"you get what you measure\".  \r\n-If you are interested in working on cool projects that can really change the world, know that that takes a backseat to EPS here at IBM.\r\n-The employee evaluation process (\"PBC\") is severely flawed.  It is a stack ranking system, and every year those who got consecutive low marks get laid off.  Meaning that next year, the previously \"good\" people are now \"bottom of the barrel\", and now it's their turn.  Managers know this, and try to game the system, by rotating who gets low marks, so hopefully nobody gets low marks two years in a row.  Further, upper-level management provides quotas to local management, and I believe these quotas are tied to how the business unit performed (financially).  So if you work in STG, and STG delivered poor financial results, there will be a higher percentage of low marks for STG employees.  Keep in mind that STG works on things 2-3 years in advance.  So you may have met all your development goals (ie for the next product cycle), but the stuff that was done 2-3 years ago isn't selling well, so you get screwed.  Basically, your actual performance has very very little to do with what rating you receive.\r\n-IBM does everything their own way - they have a very severe case of \"Not-Invented-Here\" syndrome.  You will become an expert in the way that IBM does things - and this may or may not transfer well to any other company.  Being employed here for a long time will likely hinder your efforts to find a job elsewhere if ever you decide to move.  \r\n-If you do take advantage of \"flexibility\" in terms of working from home, do be aware that there is a risk you (and your contributions) will be less visible to management, leading to a higher likelyhood of a low rating.\r\n-Pay is below market.  They come out and tell you, during your yearly salary review, where you stand with respect to average market wages in the local job market.

Also, every country has its own culture and peculiarities. IBM is pretty binary, people either tend to join and then leave again after a year or two, or they just stay on for the rest of their career. IBM certainly attracts a certain kind of people\r\n\u2014 In the UK the benefits are eye-wateringly good, all made possible by the negotiating power and size of the organization. For example in the UK you can buy and sell holiday days, 25 days leave are standard, and the pension plan is amazing. Some people sell enough days to end up with a 6 or 7-week holiday\r\n\u2014 There is a reason people with families stay so long, since IBM offers stable employment with great benefits and are really good with parental leave etc.\r\n\u2014 IBM is a financially very solid company, with lots of money in the bank, and lots of resources\r\n\u2014 You can do well if you just do everything that is asked of you. Stay compliant with everything, do everything that is asked of you, and you can get away with working there for a long time with minimal effort.\r\n\u2014 If you have the right aptitude for \"playing the game\", you will last long and get ahead within the company\r\n\u2014 Technically parts of their business is actually ahead of the curve and can be pretty exciting, there is some innovation, and opportunities to learn a lot of new things. However, you can't just do anything you like, you can only learn about the products and technology that relate to your group\r\n\u2014 IBM is a very hierarchical organization, that moves at the speed of a supertanker. However, since it is so big this can also open up opportunities within IBM. You can rise slowly within the ranks, and go very far without ever changing employer. It is also possible to apply for jobs internally and even transfer to other countries\r\n\u2014 There is a great culture for working remotely and often no requirement to come into an office on a regular basis even. Many IBMers leverage this by buying a house in a lower-cost area, work remotely from their house, and then get IBM to pay their expenses to travel to the office\r\n\u2014 Successful people at IBM observe patterns to how the business moves, make a record of reoccurring events, since IBM can be very predictable in how it does things. Be good at this, know what is coming up next and use that to your advantage and you will \"float\" nicely within the organization", "cons": "\u2014 IBM is a huge organization. You are a tiny part of a cog in a giant cogwheel.\r\n\u2014 There is lots of red tape for everything. Literally everything.\r\n\u2014 The key to success in IBM primarily relates to who you know within IBM, how well you network and \"sell\" yourself, and how well you get on with your manager. Do this well and you go far, fail to network or somehow fall out with your manager and you will be at a disadvantage. The manager you are assigned is always pot luck, you can be lucky and get a really good one who shields you from all the IBM process rubbish, or you get a bad one who does not care, micromanages or doesn't know how to get the best out of their team. In most companies this is not so much of an issue but in IBM it is - without good manager relations you won't got anywhere and it's sink or swim.\r\n\u2014 They care more about trivial things not being done than what you do - it is always about process than anything else. Expect to hear nothing from anyone for a while, then suddenly get an email saying you have to go fill in some form that day and that it's suddenly very urgent.\r\n\u2014 IBM are currently led by accountants - they have all the power in the organization and always call the shots. For better and for worse.\r\n\u2014 IBM locations are usually in the middle of nowhere, grey, dreary, bit fuddy-duddy, barren and boring. People tend to be very formal, a lot of people wear suits, and most of their customers are banks and other boring large corporations. There is no free anything at IBM sites, not even coffee and few people if any work weekends or evenings (but many work flexible hours from home). \r\n\u2014 Expect a \"tattletale\" culture where if you have done something that is not liked or you haven't done something yet they won't ask you straight to your face but instead go straight to your manager, tell on you and report (or \"escalate\") you. A really charming culture. \r\n\u2014 A lot of people are always getting moved around a lot, going from one role to another, whereas others may have had the same role for the past 30 years, especially if they are technical\r\n\u2014 In some parts of the business there is a yearly upheaval. Every January the business scrambles like crazy to get to grips with all the changes that are always imposed. The whole organization goes into a giant flux, which only crystallizes in February and continues until next January. People, roles, teams and whole business units get moved around and changed so you need to be resilient to constant change and be comfortable with uncertainty.\r\n\u2014 Since everyone moves around so much you have to use your own initiative to get anywhere. Every January, expect a proportion of your colleagues to be gone - fired, resigned or moved to a different role and there is not much stability, with a very short yearly time-horizon\r\n \u2014 There is an almost bizarre Leader culture, with infrequent webcasts with presentations from Our Great Leaders, whom are normally uninspiring and seem more like the headmaster of your school than a leader of a multi-billion-dollar organisation\r\n\u2014 IBM really takes the fun out of everything, and some people may feel it just slowly saps their life energy\r\n\u2014 IBM is a self-service organization. It's like being at college again, no one tells you anything, no one does anythiung for youy. There are self-service tools for everything and to get ahead you really have to help yourself\r\n\u2014 When joining IBM you are sucked into their universe and IBMers generally just care about the world inside IBM. It also hard to not become an IBMer, which really means people who have been institutionalized by working there for so long.\r\n\u2014 If you are in sales/tech sales then you may want to watch out since the commission paid is at the discretion of the company. In tech sales you will normally receive a profit sharing payment on a quarterly basis, where the amount distributed to your manager depends on how well your part of the business has done. You are therefore held hostage to how others perform and you have no control over this. The amount that then gets assigned by the manager to each individual team member also depends on how good you are at convincing your manager of your value, since the amount distributed by your manager relies upon a subjective evaluation of how well you have performed that quarter. Again, this comes back to your rappor with your manager - if that is good then life will be good in IBM. If you are in pure sales the amount of commission paid to you is at the discretion of the company, backed up by a deliberately vague agreement called an IPL, which says that IBM can pay you some or all or no commission.

I don't feel like the salary and benefits in service delivery match what I could get elsewhere in the industry as a top performer."}, {"review_title": "Good starting place for your career - just remember to fill in all your paperwork or else...", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Aug 2008", "job_title": "Graduate IT Consultant in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "IBM is one huge team, and you feel it. I have worked a few other places before and it really is great about how you can connect across all of IBM to ask for advice on specific questions - people give their time willingly (at least at the lower levels) to help out on minor questions and concerns. Below are a few of the things that make me happy to work at IBM;\r\n- The amount of R&D and global awareness at the brand makes you feel proud to work at IBM.\r\n- 'giveback' (i.e. giving some of your time to help charities/at external events) - in this way IBM is really ahead of the competition... you can do as much as you want (mostly in your own time, though you can just work back the hours if you need to do it during the day)\r\n- Fair pay reviews... your pay reviews are 'fair' in that everyone tends to get the same kind of rises (or lack of them!) in the early stages of the company... this isn't always an advantage if you're a top performer - but if you just want to coast along it has a certain advantage. You also know that IBM uses a pretty fixed bell curve for performance monitoring, its hard but you know if you are PBC 1 you are top 5-7%, PBC2+ = next 10%, 2 (the majority) and 3 (cause for concern) is also around 10%, and 4 means that you are being told to get another job.\r\n- At the moment business is booming, IBM (in services) is having a very good time, over the past 2 years I've had 2 rises of around 10% (Been PBC1 = top performer) and a 10% bonus. This doesn't always happen I understand, but there is lots of work and IBM is doing well, which bodes well for future payrises despite a weaker economy\r\n- Brown-nosing isn't always the best way... yes... IBM seems to actively discourage brown-nosing, don't get me wrong, you have to get on well with your peers, but if you are actively perceived as brown nosing it will actually do you more harm than good - good news in my book!\r\n\r\nNow on to the part that depends on the business you work in - essentially you want (need!) to be working in a client facing role, otherwise IBM will occasionally decree that you can't travel ANYWHERE (near the end of a quarter or year), you will also be prevented from even buying a pencil (the infamous expenses freeze that seems to be a way of life now at Big Blue). However, as I work in services, and all my expenses are client billable, I get first class travel (train), or business (plane). I get complete freedom as to which hotels I stay in (As long as they are within reason), am not forced to live in a shared apartment etc (though IBM will give you money for flats on client sites if you would prefer it to living in a hotel collecting points).", "cons": "- A lot of people dislike the paperwork required for promotions/professional ratings (I don't!) - but, if you can't articulate yourself well and explain why you deserve to get a promotion it ain't going to happen for a few more years. This brings around a general point about administration and paperwork... there is a lot of it.\r\n- Salary is also a bit of an issue, with most people feeling that the company provides poor (or no) raises to the majority of employees regularly - even when it tells Wall Street and the world it has been the best year ever. Also when you work at a company that only ever aims to pay the 'market average' salary it means you always know that you can switch to a competitor for a big raise - and this happens frequently which makes you wonder why you stay!\r\n- Remember earlier I mentioned the good things around travel... well, this is only when you aren't costing IBM money travelling - if you are internally charged you have to ask (beg) for permission to travel, get standard class and a bit less flexibility about hotels (though still a good choice) - but, this can be just taken away for months at a time to meet targets.\r\n- General poor morale: many people in the UK haven't had any payrise (or had less than 1-2%) for the past 5/6 years, it is starting to show in general discontent\r\n- Moving targets. At the start of each year you agree to a pre-set IBM target for what you are going to achieve this year, this generally focuses on a utilisation percentage, and other more wolly things. Unfortunately at the end of the year even if you meet all of these targets you are judged against everyone else, so that can mean you think you had a good year, and everyone else did even better so you don't get the rating you might want.\r\n- If you can't manage your manager give up. Pretty much everything at IBM is the responsibility of a people manager, this isn't the person you work for on a day-to-day basis, but rather a career manager. If you can't manage them well you won't get raises, promotions, training or anything else good. If you don't get on with your manager you are in trouble, so, make sure you have this skill or don't join IBM. The fact you are disconnected from them and they don't work with you on a day-to-day basis means you need to do a good job of 'advertising' your success to them, otherwise you won't do so well."}, {"review_title": "Good place to work if you can stand the billable hour stupidity and the outsourcing stupidity.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Aug 2008", "job_title": "Advisory I/T Architect in Lexington, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The flexible work schedule, the good pay, and the people I work with are the primary things that keep me here.

That leads to a lot of really stupid decisions, and they're losing good people left and right because of this.  Another primary strategy is to get rid of as many US employees as possible (due to cost), so these people are not being replaced.\r\n\r\nNobody seems to care if an employee in a different country can do the job at all.  They're cheaper, so they're hired.  Just like in the US, some of these folks are bright and motivated -- we don't pay competitively in those countries, so you can bet you're training them up for some other company.

While I can see this as a way to minimize labor expenses, it goes against everything I've ever been trained to do for customers.\r\nMany people in the Global Services division just got a 15% pay cut, even though we are making a profit and IBM as a whole is doing well.\r\nIBM is a huge company; there is a tremendous amount of red tape, and innovation is not a concept. Individual recognition is not given. For example, I came up with a need the customer had and worked with the customer and IBM to add a service to the contract; it is extra work for me, but brings in nearly the equivalent of my salary each year. I never heard \"thank you\" from anyone at IBM, and my salary was cut 15% like everyone else. I see other services that I could offer that would bring in additional revenue, but there is no reward, only extra work, so I would be foolish to put in the effort to set these up."}, {"review_title": "Nice to work at home sometimes but don't expect to be well paid for it... and don't get too comfortable", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Oct 2008", "job_title": "Senior Consultant in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting projects - cutting-edge business issues and technology at large complex clients\r\nColleagues are professional, cordial and intelligent --- many have a good sense of humor\r\nFills a hole on your resume while you look for another job with more potential\r\nSurprising breadth and depth of expertise available within IBM\r\nAccess to rich intellectual capital and self-study courses with varying levels of usefulness \r\nVariety of work / life balance programs are available.  \r\nMany internal jobs are structured as  'work from home' .

It would take a significant amount of focus and resources to make improvements in the area of Human Resources. They have layoffs every year and you never know when your number is up.  The basis for layoff is a checklist,. Employees who have poor skills, or no skills are retained because they have a required certification - PMI for example.

For the three worst years of the recession, IBM did exceedingly well. But, Sam Palmisano saw the tidal wave that was about to hit, and took a HUGE severance package, leaving our current president (Ginni Rommetty) with a mess to clean up. Eight straight quarters of declining revenue, stealth layoffs (some that have impacted entire state economies), morale that is sinking, and a North American workforce that is afraid that they won't have a job after 2015. Many are hoping to get laid off with a severance package. Even more are opting for early retirement. At least then, they can take a break and recover before looking for another job. Work life balance no longer exists. One former employee, a woman who opted for part time status (she had a child) was forced to pay $150,000 in court fees when she claimed that she was asked to work a 60 hour week, even though she was being paid for 20. While I have no court fees yet, I can personally attest that my reduced workload has been a bonanza for IBM. I am always assigned work that is improperly scoped, and when I complain that I am not being paid for a 60 hour work week, the only response that I get (from a well intentioned manager) is to be more efficient in managing my time. Whatever. IBM's forced attrition plan (aka \"Roadmap 2015) virtually guarantees that they will continue to shed honest, skilled, hard working folks. Our replacements, while nice folks, will be under paid, over-utilized, and in constant fear of losing their job. Really too bad, because IBM has the potential to turn this sinking ship around.

When things move as fast as they sometimes do here, the team can move forward with little or no direction. What's truly negative is when there's conflicting direction. Though IBM has taken steps to flatten the organization, it does remain in places very top-heavy. Also, IBM is very quarter-focused. In some places, growth is more important than numbers. In many others, too much emphasis is put on this quarter's results and not enough time on future-proofing. With constant reinvention comes constant reshuffling, and job security is not what it once was at IBM. Low-growth or less future-facing groups will constantly be pruned, which is not a great practice.

Eleven years later, I'm still here because IBM has not just given me jobs, but they've given me a career with multiple opportunities for me to learn and succeed. With it has also come multiple opportunities to fail, but with those failures came understanding managers who helped by having my back and allowing me to learn from these failures with confidence and move forward.", "cons": "Some of the downsides in working with IBM has been the usual complaints about bureaucracy and not doing enough for the employees. I honestly think that a lot of that can be found in other companies and  instead I think about everything else good that IBM has given it's employees which we often take for granted. For me, I think the biggest challenge IBM has given it's size and structure is that the messages from the top don't always come down as clearly as it can.

If you are considering joining IBM elsewhere, just know that in this sector, and this location, things are much different than the rest of the company.\r\n\r\n- If you either went to a smaller university or didn't do so great in school and want a big name on your resume to get you good job opportunities in the future, IBM is PERFECT for that. I'm going to get pretty heavy in the cons section, but just know that this point here was what made the experience for me so worth it!\r\n\r\n- This location is ~2 hours away from both Washington, D.C. and Pittsburgh, and...\r\n\r\n- If you want to travel, there are opportunities to travel. If you don't want to travel, you probably won't have to.\r\n\r\n- Health benefits are pretty decent\r\n\r\n- Most people get to work from home at least once per week\r\n\r\n- There is a pretty good chance that you will get the opportunities you need to advance within the company if you want to\r\n\r\n- If you want to become a good consultant, you will be working with a lot of good consultants.", "cons": "- The location. Cumberland is a \"city\" with not much there. Most people that end up staying long term already have an invested interest in the area (nearby college, family, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Turnover is very high. New hires come in groups, and generally if you're still around by 6 months, you are either THE last or one of the last left in your group.\r\n\r\n- Turnover is high because when you are hired, you are put \"on the bench\". That means you have to come into work...but there is nothing to do. This time frame usually lasts between 4 weeks to over a year (it sounds nice to get paid to do nothing, but it gets old real fast).\r\n\r\n- If you come here for experience in x type of work (development, testing, functional analyst), you're definitely rolling the dice. The \"staffing professionals\" are not technical people, they're trained to look at requirements for projects and match them to resumes. Their job is to keep you billable, not get you the experience you need in your career. There is a pretty good chance you get placed in a project doing work that you don't want to be doing (they will tell you that it is easy to switch down the road...don't take the bait).\r\n\r\n- There is practically no technical screening (for developers). You have a technical interview and test, but you can get EVERY question wrong and still get an offer (this actually happened in my hiring group twice). So...this goes without saying...\r\n\r\n- If you're looking to work with great developers, you're digging for needles in haystacks. You probably won't find what you're looking for. IBM has a lot of new hires that don't know what they are doing, and a lot of people with a lot of experience, but just don't make the cut.\r\n\r\n- The pay is well below average. Not only that, but even if you are good at what you do and outperform everyone you work with, chances are a year down the road, new hires (on the bench) will be making more many than you. Management will say (this happened to me twice), \"Oh that's not right, but there's nothing I can do\". Raises happen at earliest every 9 months, and your performance generally doesn't play any significant role. Everyone gets the same raise.\r\n\r\n- The performance review process has currently undergone a change (from what I'm told is for the better). However, managers are very inconsistent as to what the requirements are, and if you happen to be caught in a re-organization, you may quickly find out that what you are doing that was considered acceptable for your old manager is unacceptable to your new manager.\r\n\r\n- You are told that after 2 years in this program that you can transfer out, and they will help you do so. This is true, you can, and they will...but corporate IBM will actively work against you on this. I never saw anyone get transferred out. Places like Rocket Center are where IBM actually makes their money because they can afford to pay you less for the same work that people in DC -> More winning bids on government contracts."}, {"review_title": "What should be the right sequence of priorities?", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "13 May 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pride - we create and apply technologies to make the business world work better.

If you're young enough, this can be a crash course-- almost a business degree and the inner workings of a very large company, from the terminology, the bureaucracy, and networking in general.", "cons": "1) It's an old company and quite a few people are still holding out for retirement, so it\u2019s not the \u201cfreshest\u201d mentality. \r\n2) Lay-offs are extremely common, products are pushed out or sold before they're even built, and my personal biggest issue was that female managers trying too hard to be in the \"boy's club\" that is IBM. This results in a lot of unnecessary competition and jealousy between females over ridiculous stuff, but it\u2019s really only a problem when that female is your manager. In other words, there isn't a lot of support amongst the females because there are so few and the glass ceiling seems to be on the first floor at IBM. I normally wouldn't even notice such a thing because I\u2019m not a raging feminist, but it was cut-throat there. One or two instances, okay, maybe it's me, but it was rampant. Consequently, by the time I left, I worked for one of the best bosses I've ever had (a man) and was happy to leave on a good note. \r\n3) There's also a lot of nepotism because a lot of the younger people that do come to work there are almost always the offspring of someone who's worked there for most of their life. The higher up the parent, the better the gig or building address/location (NYC/Austin) for their kid. \r\n4) If you want to move to another position in the company, there are usually plenty, but you have to network. I held several positions in my four years there, mostly due to layoffs or complete dissolution of my department due to the whim of some organizational consultant, but I rarely landed another position from someone I hadn't networked or dealt with before. They like to do \"informational interviews\", which is just another way of finding out if they like you or not before they go through any of the enormous red-tape to do an official interview or bring you into their department. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that, but I can imagine there are some people who aren\u2019t really good at networking, but are phenomenal at their job, who don\u2019t get to move up, or on, because the ONE person on the other end of the phone has written you off before you\u2019ve even applied.\r\n5) Used to be able to work from home, but they started changing it when I left in 2016 to making people go into unprepared and ill-equipped open-office spaces. Working from home made people more comfortable, which reflected in their work attitudes.\r\n6) Last, but not least, were the times (too many to count) where I was instructed to work on something that was of utmost importance and urgency, only to be told hours or days later that they had completely scrapped the idea and moved on. It was hard to ever feel accomplished when what you toiled and slaved over for days was thrown out the window. I literally would stay up all night working on something my boss had told me was an emergency only to be told in the morning she\u2019d changed her mind.

However, 1,5 year later, while at the same time, as our office started to become overcrowded with new hires, we were all suddenly given permanent home offices!\r\n-No proper technical introduction was given, so there were too many vague things when we began to work and when those vague things created issues, it was us who were blamed for \"not asking about it\" by the team lead.\r\n-No encouragement for the work/ appreciation of the small successes from the local management. However, when things went wrong, critization came in right away.\r\n-Other branches of the IBM Security (in the US and Belgium especially) treated Poland like trash (at least for our team), and gave the drudgery work all the time, thinking that the team in Poland wasn't competent enough, while at the same time, doing nothing to change that.\r\n-There was no constant salary increase at all! which meant that you could work there for 10 years with the same salary!\r\n-Even if officially everything was diverse, equal etc in relation with IBM's values, unofficially, it was extremely hard for a foreign to become a manager in the security department (don't know if anything has changed since then)\r\n-\"Follow the sun\" approach was followed in an exploitive way for the employees of Poland. Meaning, whenever there was a lack of human resource in the US, people from Poland were forced to work on night shifts for neglective additional salaries (like 50-100zl/month) and since it was already on our contract, we had nothing to say, how long it could last etc. all depended on the managers in the US (in my case, it lasted for 10 months!). In short, the cheap Polish labour was abused by IBM.\r\n-In general, everyone was whining or complaining about something locally all the time (can't blame them for that though), which created a negative aura in the office all the time."}, {"review_title": "As the name of the company is enough, but that is not all.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Apr 2020", "job_title": "Technical Support Associate in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "On time salary\r\nFriendly Environment\r\nGood Cafeteria\r\nManagers are supportive\r\nShift allowances.\r\nTime will provide the fruit but that time is not everything, depends on your luck as well as the bonding within the department.", "cons": "Working hours will break you completely\r\nLess floor support\r\n10 hours shift.\r\nYou will be told about the opportunities at the time of joining, later you will find the reality.\r\nVertical movement is possible but don't think about any horizontal movement."}, {"review_title": "I am about to share my deepest, darkest/brightest, thoughts/truths, with you.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 May 2020", "job_title": "Unix/Linux Systems Administrator in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are a lot of advantages to join the IBM than other companies few i can mention\r\n1.

The new leadership team is so focused on making quarter over quarter growth numbers and year over year growth numbers that they are doing unnatural things that appear to help the numbers but anger clients and staff and hurt the business both short term and long term.  Some Examples:\r\n     a.   Running a near zero bench in a growing economy is one sure way to anger clients and causes DE issues (an IBM term for \"Delivery Excellence\")\r\n     b.  The \"no subs\" policy ignores the reality of the economic market and taken together with a. above, form a toxic mix which disappoints clients and causes them to wonder why they picked IBM in the first place.\r\n     c.   Putting cost savings methods directly on the heads of the employees - including such stupid things as i. once a year 401K matching (which is a clever prelude to doing away with matching altogether);  ii. no raises or bonuses;  iii.  too-frequent RAs (Resource Actions) - with little or no severance pay, even for very senior employees (a Partner friend of mine got laid off and got two weeks severance!!!);  iv. draconian travel policies (including the renting of only sub-sub-compact cars and only coach travel for overseas flights).\r\n     d.  Making stupid deals with clients at the end of quarters just to bolster signings - deals that do not meet minimum IBM standards are being allowed at or near the end of quarters, regardless of risk or economics, simply to add to backlog and make the numbers look better.   These deals - and I have seen many recently - will come back to bite IBM in the butt in future quarters as IBM begins to experience DE issues and massive write offs.    This last point together with a. and b. above, are a sure-fire way to ruin IBM's reputation in the marketplace.  \r\n     e.   Making unwise M&A transactions which help margin but makes IBM less competitive in the marketplace.   The most recent example is the Concentrix spin off.   A low margin business for sure, but absolutely necessary for a Tier 1 service provider to be in the BPO business.   By spinning this off, IBM gets to have higher margins overall, but gives up a very key market and can no longer be called a \"full services\" Tier 1 provider."}, {"review_title": "Not good to start your career with, but better for senior position", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Jul 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "No seperate cabins for different job positions.

But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company. 1.

Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. 2. Great colleagues! Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business. 3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.", "cons": ". Unfortunately, IBM still uses the \"normal distribution\" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%), above average contributor (15%), average contributor (~75%), and bottom contributor (5%). This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being \"average contributors\" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors. 2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent \"above average\" rating in the last 4-5 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary. Were I rated \"average contributor\" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary. From talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower. 3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets. This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams. 4.
