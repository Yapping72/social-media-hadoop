We are measured by what we produce and not by our physical presence.  While sometimes there is no substitute for face to face contacts, by and large we are able to accomplish what we need through email, instant msging and phone calls. \r\n\r\nAnother good reason is the many job opportunities in IBM - I can change jobs and not have to change companies.
