Often these latter are mandatory and of course everybody switches them on and goes and makes a coffee. 10 years ago IBM had a planned annual process where you agreed training with your manager, obtained quality training (because it was in your plan); now you are presented with HOURS and HOURS of mandatory dross put together cheaply to let our CEO think we are all being trained in the latest technology.\r\nPensions quality has been driven down and down (court cases still being heard on this), so although it is better than average, don't expect it to stay that way\r\nEverything that can be sold or cut seems to have been in a desparate attempt to hit Sam Palmisano's ill-judged promise to hit $20 by 2015 revenue. It was obvious to most people a while ago it wasn't going to happen. Executives took a loooooooonnnng time to wake up and cancel that impossible dream.\r\nYou have a lot of leeway due to hands off management; but this is largely because no manager seems to want to say/write/do anything that they could be judged for later, so they sit on their hands stay silent. \r\nFrom all of the above you might not be surprised to learn that morale is lower than low. New starter graduates might find it quite an exciting environment, most will move on when they fail to get a rise for 5 years.\r\nRedundancies are now an annual tradition, a big re-org this year is mostly moving the deckchairs on the Titanic I'm afraid and has had the effect of freezing any decision making process for several months as no manager wants to be responsible for deciding anything they might be held culpable for later."}, {"review_title": "IBM has gone downhill fast in the last decade.

Your manager in most cases has no idea what your daily tasks are or specifics to your role. Then you will get promoted and it gets worse. They pile on more work with about a 1K bump in pay. This is the point most people leave. They are really good at giving you a ton of work knowing they can replace you with another college graduate. The turnover in the COE is unreal over 35%. the average person lasts a year and a half. Really its only that high because the people that have been there more than 3 yrs their spouse works at mayo and they are not moving. Be ready for a ton of work with no pay and no appreciation. Most likely you will start with 15-30 new hires and after 3 months half will have quit for better jobs.

I worked for IBM for 20 years.  Things started out good, but then Sam Palmisano became CEO and it started to go down hill, for the employees.  When Ginni Rometty took over in 2012, the descent only accelerated, much like the descent in the stock price.\r\n\r\nWork life balance was terrible at IBM.  The only focus was on billable utilization.  Utilization targets ranged from 90% for very senior people to 114% for junior people.  That means billing 1872 hrs to 2371 hrs per year to clients.  This does not include your administrative work that you need to do.  Nor does it include travel time or professional development time.  After taking into account sick time, vacation and holiday time; in addition to your administrative work, travel time and professional development time it became obvious to anyone that making their BU targets were achievable in a normal work week.  \r\n\r\nWhen I pointed out to management that if I missed more than 5 days in a year I would not make my BU targets.  Keep in mind that I had 20 earned vacation days and 10 stat holidays.   I was told that we were expected to work OT to make up for our time away in order to make the BU targets.  That's right.  Work unpaid over time to make up for annual leave that you have earned and for stat holiday time that they are legislated to give you.  This is how it becomes necessary to work 50+ hrs per week just to meet your BU targets.  60+ hrs a week are fairly normal and burst periods of 70 to 80 hrs a week occur a number of time a year.  IBM even demands that people work from home if they are sick, rather than actually take a sick day.  Many people even do some work while on vacation.  I had had to do some work even over Christmas holidays.  If I add up my BU, travel time, admin time and professional development time I clocked in an average of 2500 hours every year.  That amounts to about 16 weeks per year more work than the average Canadian worker.\r\n\r\nAnyone who posts on Glassdoor that work life balance is a PRO for IBM either has a very low bar for work life balance or is a plant from IBM to write bogus reviews to offset the negative reviews.\r\n\r\nThe performance reviews have a 5 point scale.  1, 2+, 2, 3 and 4; 1 being the top performers.  Performing at a 1 (which I did on several annual reviews) gets you a whopping 1.5% pay increase and 1.5% to 2.5% bonus.  Get a 2+ and you one or the the other, depending on the year.  Hardly keeping up with the cost of living.  And that is for the top performers.  2 and 3 you get to keep your job.... for the time being.  4 and you are put on probation with unrealistic targets; which, if not met, will result in your dismissal.  I remember one year, on the back drop of optics of no-one getting a bonus, Ginni Rometty announced that she would not be getting her bonus either.  But she still got her $7M in shares.  I guess her $1.6M base salary was not enough to live on.  And this is even after the stock price has been in a down trend since she took the CEO position.  Isn't stock price her one job to take care of?  That sounds like a poor performance rating to me.  A very disingenuous move on her part.\r\n\r\nProfessional development is a joke.  You are expected to take IBM online training on your own time.  I took some training outside of the company once that was specifically relevant to my role at the time.  Initially IBM refused to pay for it.  After my manager (1st line manager) went to bat for me, the senior managers agreed to cough half the cost.  This was for skills development that made me even more productive immediately.  Yet another example of how employees are viewed as a liability, not an asset.\r\n\r\nIBM is on constant lay-off mode.  The going joke in my office was to call out on Monday morning \"Who is still here?\"\r\n\r\nIBM tries to short change people on their severance packages.  When people fight the severance IBM looses every time, but the people have to fight.  IBM plays a numbers game.  For every person who fights and gets a bigger severance there are 10 who don't.  IBM rides the raged edge of the labour law, trying to implement U.S. style labour policies.  Some of the managers that I knew would tell me stories of IBM lawyers reminding executives that Canadian labour law would not let them do some of the things that they wanted.\r\n\r\nMaternity leave top up is a joke.  I know two separate women who were given poor performance ratings on two consecutive years because they did not meet BU targets.  These just happened to be years that their maternity leaves intersected with.  No pro-rating of the BU for the time that they were actually in the office.  There is no parental leave top up for dads.  \r\n\r\nIf you really must have the IBM name on your CV then have an exit strategy.  Five years max then get out and take your experience with you.

So many times, I had to chase people to do their jobs. Though, for IBM, hiring incompetent people seems like a great way to create manager jobs.\r\n3. Upper management (at least HR) tries to 'inspire' through fear-mongering, and this trickles down to the lower levels. Employees are afraid to ask for simple, reasonable requests in fear of backlash from managers. I've also heard them directly mock their employees in front of others like a child on a playground.\r\n- Like other service companies, IBM offers a wide variety of industries for your interest. However, management appears to 'block' most movement. Some of my colleagues were patient enough and waited 5 years for a change. Others gave up and left the company for a higher pay position in the industry they were looking for.\r\n4. The individual target bonuses are high, but the company is leaking money, so rewards are low.

Disorganized - IBM has become so large that it is nearly impossible to really work 'as a team'. Like many consulting firms, IBM has resources in other countries (mainly India) due to cost. Unlike other consulting firms, the travel 'legislators' do not work well; they are not flexible. On an internal deployment, IBM travel refused to grant approval to even APPLY for a visa for my Indian colleagues because the IBM criteria of X days was not met. \r\n6. Too much time is spent on administrivia. Things which should be simple like time cards, expenses, booking travel require so many hoops, IBM has pages-long documentation on how to get one travel request.

So in the CTC,they show big package, but pay much less than that. So ur actual in hand salary will be : Total salary - variable salry - performace bonus.  i.e, ..u will get only fixed salary as annual package in hand  and not more than that.You can almost neglect the varibale salary and performance bonus from ur packag as they are paid almost nil at end of year.  \r\n\r\n(ii) Variable pay is paid only once a year in march. So who left the company after 9-10 months, his/her variable pay will be lost. Unlike other companies \r\nwhere variblae pay is given quartrely. So u can almost neglect the varibale pay from ur package which will not be paid to you.\r\n\r\n(iii)Very-Very Low package : While joining , company gives very less hike (normally not more than 20% -25%). u r ver lucky if u got more than that.\r\n But hike is very -very less here and that too not paid well.\r\n\r\n(iv) Appraisal : Apraisal is almost nil here. Maximum 2%-3% after 1 year and that too with best rating otherwise for avergae rating, not more tha 1%.\r\n\r\n(v) Work field :well in IBM, u will be recruited for some other technology and will be put in another technology. People with SAP skill set are working on excel sheets here. People with automation testing experts are forcefully dumped into maual testing. This practice is very -very common in IBM.\r\nSo technical u r very much risky here.

I was here for long time and i have not seen HR  in this company.no body knows who is their HR and no comm from their side also.\r\n\r\n(viii) Perfomance bonus : this is a part of ur package (3% of CTC) but will not be paid more than  0.5 % at all ..does not matter how well u have performed.\r\n\r\n(viii) there are lot of other hell things in the company.....a jungle of politics..... here everythng is in ur people manger hand.  \r\n\r\n(ix) If u resign before one year, thay will make ur notice period from 1 month to 3 months and again u have to fight back for  this.\r\nOfficially notice period is 1 month for first 1 year in company but they will increase that to 3 months whenver thay want (before completing 1 year) ..generally  with in 7-8 months of period  \r\n\r\n(x) The iteration rate of company is  more than 40%.

Once you reach that milestone, anything you enjoyed about your old company will be swept away with meaningless corporate double-speak and pointless meetings.  My team was about 60 people when we were brought on board, and after three years only 5 remain.\r\n\r\nThe entire point of US based IBM is to fire all senior people, outsource all work overseas, and hire recent graduates for minimal salaries.  The entire time I was at IBM, there was zero positive feedback from upper level management, which is ironic since IBM acquired my company because we were beating them left and right in the market.  The acquisitions only occur to remove competition.  Other teams will absorb your product and fight for the scraps.  Once Transfer of Business and Bluewashing are complete, you are expendable.\r\n\r\nEverything IBM does is to encourage US based employees to quit.  Changing the 401k match to only occur once a year was another example of this mentality. Stack ranking employees and firing a set percentage every quarter has occurred at IBM every year for the past decade.  Zero perks like coffee or even water, obsolete technology, terrible internal tools like Lotus Notes, complete lack of concern for the team.  The only thing that matters is the stock price and delivering dividends to the stockholders.  Respect for employees is not even on the list.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are minimal.  IBM health insurance charges you per child, up to six kids.  If you have a larger family you will be paying massively for poor coverage. 401k match is insulting, the only free perk is water in the water fountains.  Even the benefit of working from home is being removed, which makes sense since IBM frowns on any type of 'perk' or 'benefit' for the rank-and-file employees.\r\n\r\nMy advice, don't even consider working here.  You will not be appreciated in any way.  If you are acquired, leave once your stock vests and don't bother contributing while there.

They mentioned Java and spring resource is required but their actual work is in older version of Java and in Applet and Swing. \r\n\r\n(Support and shifts)\r\nDuring the interview they may tell you that work structure would be like 80% development and 20% support. But more than 50% work is in support and that is also L1+L2 support.This project have weekly rotational second shift and developer has to support in shift.There are 10 public holidays every year but because of shifts each team member has to support at least 1 public holidays out of 10. And in those days person has to work for 12 hrs instead of 9 hrs.\r\n\r\n(Experience with overall team)\r\nLateral resources with 3 to 8 years of experience coming from other organization or from other IBM project usually leave this project within 1 or 2 years.I have seen more than 10 farewells in less than a year.In this entire project, most of the resources are from mainframe and few are from java. Its not a development or maintenance or enhancement project.Its a support project. Java resource is the least valuable resource in this project.There is no team bonding. Old members can use new members to cover their mistakes in front of client. You may face group-ism. Favoritism from boss is also very common, and that is even for those people who are technically worst but listen each and every thing of their boss and force new members to do unrealistic thing. Old team members create dependency and hide many things from new joiner to secure their place in the project and in front of client.No transparency about the tasks. New joiner remains unaware from many things even after a year . Old team members easily get big leaves for their vacation but new people get limited leaves(hardly a week- even after sufficient leaves are available in their buckets) even for genuine reasons like to take care of hospitalized parents, for once in a life moments and  other important work.\r\n\r\n(Work from home and work culture)\r\nWork from home is not a part of this project even though IBM is famous for that. Only few political people are eligible for that.This people focus on documentations more than technical things. Making 10 documents for the same same thing is highlighted more than new  optimization ideas, new strategies/techniques used in the project.Many times this documents are getting created in hurry as a part of the process. 8 out of 10 times this documents are created with lack of requirement information.So they are not actually useful for the people who will refer them in future.Instead of seating with Client and finalizing appropriate solution and proper planing they emphasize on work to be done(documentation, coding, testing). They don't have BA/Tech arch. Programmer seat with client finalize the solution which ultimately turn into technical loopholes at the end of project.\r\n\r\nOne resource perform task of two resources.\r\n\r\n(Pathetic Time sheet management system)\r\nTime sheet claiming system is very bad. PMO can shout on you if you have done mistake in filling the time sheet. In first six months you really do not understand whether to focus on your work or in filling the time sheet properly. Many times you spend your valuable time in calculating and adjusting your hours among the tasks assigned to you.Utilization, that is claiming 9 hours everyday in timesheet is the most important whether you have worked on that particular task or not, doesn't matter you just have to put time against some task. If you are working on a development project for which somebody else has given estimation long back ago  and you are taking extra time then it is your fault and over burning of timesheet which is not acceptable.Utilization of resource should be 104%. There are many open change requests in their stack. You can take and work on such open requests in weekends to increase your utilization beyond expected 104%(This may help in your appraisals). If you are taking privilege leaves then it can impact your utilization. In such cases you can work on public holidays for 12 hours and maintain your utilization.Indirectly privilege leaves is not a right of an employee.You can have unlimited sick leaves but again it is questionable and not acceptable even if it is used while having genuine reasons or emergencies.\r\n\r\n(Managers)\r\nResource is responsible if resource's manager doesn't have work for the resource.Manager usually do not respect resource's priority after office hours. They may ask you to do work(Support) even in high fever(in this situation work from home is OK). Managers only think about billing hours of an employee(technology, innovation, automation, new ideas are not important, all the time they follow same old school methods) .There is a concept of people manager who takes care of your shift allowance approvals, appraisals, leaves approval, trainings etc. You and your people manager(who may not be from your project)should talk on daily basis to monitor your progress but my manager talked with me only for 2 times, on first day and on last day.Manager can ask female employees to stretch till late night in shifts(They don't provide any cab service during night and Airoli is like an outside area for the people leaving in Mumbai), unprofessional attitude of managers. Biased Appraisal culture.Managers are very bad in estimations and management.There is no BA who can tackle and deal with client properly which eventually results in setting unrealistic deadlines.Manager never encourage you to spend your time in trainings available at IBM portal because it is again a non profitable task which you can claim in timesheet but project will not earn from it.\r\n\r\n(Technical)\r\nDeveloper's local system setup usually does not work and people working there from last 4 years doesn't have idea about it. Since they have not taken proper KT from their seniors(This project's  ex-team members). Its a hell for Java resource.

In addition, those that were labeled as being unproductive were either encouraged to increase performance or they were part of the regular resource actions (layoffs).

When a new executive is appointed to make changes within an organization, those changes come slowly, or not at all.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, an employee looking to distinguish his/herself from the pack needs to seriously network.  There is no 'automatic' climb to the top with hard work... even if you immediate management recognizes your talents.  You MUST reach beyond your organization and network, network, network. \r\n\r\nFinally, with layoffs the workload does not diminish, but is reassigned.

Maybe the Watson team has it better, but the enterprise division is very sales, services, and metrics based. As a developer, you are undervalued and often burdened with fulfilling promises made by people who will make a commission on your fulfillment. That's pretty much the best case scenario.\r\n\r\nI mentioned metrics because IBM uses a bell-curve system. Meaning some ONE has to be the best and some ONE has to get a trash rating that can threaten their chance at raises or even employment. Speaking of raises, you won't really get any unless you leave and come back. The metrics are block-box and no matter how many times the team tried to pin down specifics, management gave us vague responses or tried to placate us. The way Banding works is supposed to get you more compensation, but ends up as a way to give lateral promotions with increases in responsibilities without increases in compensation.\r\n\r\nYou'll often be compelled to use tools not because it's the best solution to your problem, but because IBM eats its own dog food. It doesn't matter whether this tool actually has the features you use; someone who drank enough kool-aid (or who is under the thumb of someone who has) will tell you to use the IBM product. This can be annoying for developers who want to get things done instead of playing politics. \r\n\r\nAs a developer, you are encouraged to draft and submit software patents because IBM is a participant in the current patent wars like other major tech companies. Think about that what you will.\r\n\r\nIn Sales/services, the focus seems more on getting IBM its money than actually providing quality service to the customer. Things like being encouraged to spend hours within certain time periods, without too much concern for whether the customer actually needed services.

I joined after the start up I was working for was acquired by them.  At first I thought this would be an amazing opportunity and a place I could build my career at.  I honestly went into this thanking the universe for such an amazing turn of luck.  As time went on this feeling was replaced with more a sense of \"it could be worse\" to \"At least I have golden hand cuffs\" to \"This place is insane and makes me hate my work life, IBM is making me lazy and stupid\"\r\n\r\nSome of the worst parts of the job center around how the company organizes itself and the general bloat in employees and management.  There are countless people working at the company that have a vested interest in nothing changing as their skills have stagnated over the last 10-20 years.  This place and their job are literally all they know.  A few examples of this:\r\n\r\n- for a company that prides itself on technology it is embarrassing they still widely use Notes as the primary email client.  Some job duties have no other option but to use Notes as the tool even as email has shifted to a web client. The software is unstable, slow, and non-intuitive\r\n\r\n- In my department we used a database that was initially written in 1968.  That's not a joke.  When the idea of men walking on the moon was science fiction IBM created the database that is widely used for ticketing in critical needs roles at IBM\r\n\r\n- the interface for said DB is again a plugin for a notes client\r\n\r\n- Efforts to create a new interface that was web based and levels easier to use were actively thwarted by management that didn't want to change the way things were.\r\n\r\n- efforts to change the way we communicate to even just allow us to talk with our colleagues more easily were actively prevented.\r\n\r\nThe direct manager I had was also verbally abusive and took to screaming at me during a meeting while a colleague was in the room.  The event was so bad I had to involve several upper level managers to get him to stop screaming at me and mentioning my personal life outside the office in a negative context. He didn't understand the product we were on as he took over parts of the team after acquisition.  He would tell us completely wrong information and ban us from performing actions he felt were bad in his gut.  A key example of this was telling us not to suggest to customer to upgrade versions of their software because he felt it \"Caused more problems than it solved\".  This led to a lengthy talk about how the software we used was actually built using technology that is designed to be upgraded easily and often. I even confirmed this with the engineering lead and lead release engineer who had horrified looks on their face when I told them this.  \r\n\r\nThat same call also involved a 30 minute debate about whether agile or waterfall was the best way to build software today.  My manager wanted to go back to the way things were and just release software once a year when all the bugs were worked out.  I kept trying to calmly explain no one does that today. He countered with how frustrating it was to have a new release every 2 months.  I tried to tell him many companies have new releases several times a day.  IN any event it was a pointless conversation as I had no power to change the release cycle and neither did he.  The software was built and released as it was but he refused to support it that way. \r\n\r\nFor an easy example during start up days the time to solve a Sev 1 support issue would be measures in hours to days at the most.  At IBM this was more like weeks to months.  By the time a fix ever came around the customer had usually forgotten about it or moved on to other projects or products.  \r\n\r\nIBM is not innovative enough anymore to create new things itself in the software realm.  Instead they are acquiring companies to jusy buy the tech as they transition to a software model of business.  The problem is they are trying to force software start ups into their very old business model when they should be changing themselves to the new way of doing business."}, {"review_title": "Good at first, but wears on you", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Dublin, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and resources, many long-term employees with high expertise that you can learn from, usually a decent mix of casual culture and business culture (ie not a startup but not business professional - you can have fun)", "cons": "Tons of bureaucracy, management makes mistakes and blames problems on those below them, focus on sales over actually creating the project"}, {"review_title": "Delivery Project Executive", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "11 May 2017", "job_title": "Delivery Project Executive in S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very proud to be an IBMer.

Employees become institutionalised by IBM and lose all their individual value and end up being dysfunctional to survive.\r\n\r\nIBM has too many managers - for every seller actually generating revenue, there are 10+ managers who add zero value, as they don\u2019t know the subject matter, the customer, the competition, they just manage spreadsheets of fictional information - tragic. Made worse by a Matrix management structure , which is outdated in todays world.\r\n\r\nTo control 400k staff, the bureaucracy is immense and broken applications / processes abound - 75% of your time can be spent on a process, just to get a simple proposal approved. \r\n\r\nManagers are almost exclusively selfish and have no concern for staff, they will sack you if it saves their chances of keeping their job / promotion. Resource Actions (layoffs) are a constant, so everyone is playing the blame game to divert responsibility for their own incompetence, which is a daily issue with customers who are deeply dissatisfied with the \"sell and run\" tactics, fostered by IBM moving staff around every 6 months.\r\n\r\nThe diversity / PC culture is used as a method to control open expression and foster a climate of fear for long term staff. It is Orwellian in its mission, any criticism is seen as a personal attack on the CEO and the \"mini Ginnis\", no matter how factual your position is. \r\n\r\nMost IBM people adopt the 'Passive Aggressive' behaviour style and will only tell you the minimum so they retain the position of perceived advantage and undermine others - forget teamwork, its every droid for themselves.\r\n\r\nA word of warning to those who think having IBM on their CV is a good thing - it's not - today the best jobs at innovative companies actively avoid taking people from the legacy IT players like IBM, as they offer no contemporary skills & only poison the culture with their learned behaviour."}, {"review_title": "Work Environment", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Dec 2018", "job_title": "Associate Systems Engineer in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stability in job.\r\nGood work-life balance.\r\nit is good to join IBM after having good experience, you will be getting great salary and respect.", "cons": "Work culture totally depend on the kind of project you are serving, project location and the colleagues.\r\nManagers have more decision power than HR.\r\nLess opportunity for graduate hires."}, {"review_title": "Great Company to work for Women", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "13 Dec 2018", "job_title": "Senior Program Manager in Chennai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.

Fortunately I am a quick study so I always muddled through the learning curves.\r\nOver the past 3 years IBM has become an intolerable place to work. Upper management is focused on quarterly results and does not outline any strategic vision or direction. It is left to the senior individual contributors to try to figure out what to do and how to prioritize the dizzying workload.  There is a constant paranoia over future layoffs and management almost seems to \"enjoy\" the power that the fear creates.  Unfortunately for my co-workers and IBM customers the fear creates a very inefficient and unproductive work environment.  The company is run via SameTIme (instant messaging) and conference calls.  It is not unusual to be on 8+ hours of conference calls a day and it is frowned upon if you decline a conference call.  Rarely are agendas sent out in advance or conference calls summarized with action items, so everyone spends all day on the phone and on email/SameTime without much meaningful work getting done. This \"ADD\" culture seems to be encouraged while thoughtful problem solving seems to be discouraged.

For the uninitiated, what this means is that each IBM GBS employee is measured by how many hours they bill to a customer or project, relative to the total working hours in a year. What is contentious about this is that they literally multiply 52 weeks by 40 hours to arrive at the over-all total of workable hours, without subtracting vacation or statutory holidays. 2080 is the magic number. That is how many hours there are in a year according to IBM. Say your target was 90%. That means you would have to bill 1872 hours (0.9*2080). However, that same employee might have three weeks of vacation, or 120 hours. The employee is expected to bill 90% of 2080. IBM does not subtract statutory holidays either. In Canada there are 10 statutory holidays will equals 80 hours. If an IBM employee billed 100% of every hour they work after vacation and holiday, they would still fall short!  That IBM employee is forced to work over time to simply make their target. Oh, and by the way, IBM does not pay over time. In conclusion, a reasonable approach would be to subtract vacation and holidays from the total workable hours in a year, and measure the utilization target against that.\r\nRecently, IBM has publically proclaimed that they have \u201cunlimited vacation.\u201d Well, as per above, you can see what is at work here. You must meet your target, so, how much unlimited vacation can you really have?

Unfortunately, regardless of your skill set there is a general pessimism towards IBMers. I think the longer your tenure at any company, the more skepticism people will have towards your skill set. Looking back I think I thought the severance package was worth waiting for mainly because I had started to believe what some managers at IBM had instilled in me: fear and self-doubt. Many times when I complained about pay, bonus money, or ratings, I got the good old \"you should be happy you have a job\". The last one my manager gave me was,\"IBM offers a lot of flexibility for you and your family\".

It is a competitive, soulless, brural place.   To survive there you have to focus only on yourself and nobody else.  Win at all costs.   As a so called Partner which is the over inflated name they give to what are essentially engagement directors with quotas, you will have a sales quota of between 10 and 20m typically, called a signings target.  You will also have a revenue target which requires you to be actively delivering an engagement.   You will also be given a personal utilization target of at least 35% at a bill rate that is quite high and a profit target.   You will be rated based on a formula of how you achieved against those metrics depending on how they are weighing each component that year and that can and does change every year.   If you do not make that number and all elements of your quota, you will be rated a 3 and be fired at the end of the year unless you are lucky enough to be part of the boys club and then they will try to manipulate the numbers enough to make you a 2.  No commissions of any sort are paid and you may not get a bonus if there is no funding in the profit sharing regardless of your rating.  Last year it is was funded at 30%.  \r\n\r\nPartners are ranked against each other in their work group and then folded into larger groups.  They are rated on  total dollar volume not percentage of attainment so if you do small deals and somebody sells things that are large deals, they will always be ranked higher.  \r\n\r\nThere are no real rules for territories.  Anybody can sell on someone else's patch and there is no shared credit. If someone does a deal in your territory and refuses to team with you, tough luck.  And if you are teaming you will have to divide up the deal among all the mouths to feed including the APs.  There is a shortage of qualified deals so people glom on.  There is this team shadow credit but it is a joke and doesn't keep you from being fired   Partners can cut out other partners by bringing in APs that have the domain knowledge.  APs love that.   APs have to do almost all the work on Rfps and there is almost no presales and/or presentation development support.  \r\n\r\nThere is no good system to forecast resource needs on a deal.  You have to fill out a tedious and outdated excel spreadsheet that is then sent to Costa Rica to be re entered   \r\n\r\nMethodology is hit or miss and there is no good knowledge sharing portal for methodology.  What there is is pretty poor and not used.  Many PMs make up stuff as they go along.   There are legions of staff people that have big dog jobs supposedly maintaining and developing methodology and produce nothing of real value.   The reason projects fail is usually due to lack of resources and/or methodolgy.  Just ask customers. \r\n\r\nThere is a shortage of consultants in many areas as staffing and hiring is not undertaken until a SOW is signed.  So on many occasions there is no way to execute and ramp up quickly.   Retention is actually fairly good considering unless it is resource action time but there are still staffing issues galore.  \r\n\r\nThere is no money for team meetings so you never get much chance to meet your colleagues and since you are pitted against them in the rating system that is probably better.    \r\n\r\nTeamwork is non existent and nobody bothers to answer emails or calls.  That bad habit is rampant.  Many of the senior people are the worst offenders.  I worked for a woman who would not even make eye contact with me in an elevator once.  It was like I didn't exist.  She was my boss's boss.   She rarely answered any emails I sent and I only sent her things on rare occasions.  One other partner I worked with would never and I mean never answer emails from almost everyone. \r\n\r\nTravel is heavy and the expense policy is typical but frugal.  The expense report system is great and some of the best software they have.  They have big data analytics to monitor every cent.  You have no discretionary budget.  You are not allows to spend money on entertainment unless you are part of the boys club and they trust you to spend to close a deal but even then there are strictl limits. \r\n\r\nMost customers in this industry are men and it is very hard for women partners to succeed.  The track record is terrible and women are given no help or accommodation for the challenges of being a woman in a male dominated industry.  None.   They bring in women and Fire them as a regular course.  The very senior women are the type that got there a while ago when it was a fad to have women in senior roles  and they are competitive and vicious and are some of the least supportive of other women.  They tend to surround themselves with the boys club to have someone to do the work.  \r\n\r\nI could go on and on but I think you get the picture   If you are willing to risk your career and are ok with being fired or reduced to nothing in a culture that devalues humans"}, {"review_title": "IBM has many varied career opportunities", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Feb 2015", "job_title": "IT Specialist in Poughkeepsie, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "IBM has a broad product line of IT hardware, software, and services.

There are some very smart and wonderful people still lingering at IBM.", "cons": "IBM has become a disastrous place to work. If you are not \"born IBM\" as a college intern or are a legacy of IBMer parents, you will NEVER be True Blue in the eyes of the brahmin who run IBM and your head will always be first on the chopping block, no matter what your performance is.\r\n\r\nYour head will spin at the number of barnacles who have been with IBM for 20, 30, or more years, many of whom have never worked for another company. On the management side, this leads to an old boy network constantly looking out for itself (I mean that in a non-gender-specific way -- there are many girls in the old boy network and they're every bit as useless). On the worker bee side, there are lots of good people who have put up with the constant drip, drip, drip of a declining company and have never overcome the inertia of leaving. Heaven help IBM if those people ever figure out what they're worth on the open market. It all results in a constant, dull-throbbing-headache approach to work instead of an exciting, challenging environment where you can feel like you're making a difference.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of performance, IBM uses Personal Business Commitments (PBCs) to evaluate employees and allocate bonus money. PBCs used to be reasonable: stretch goals, but attainable, measurable, and objective. PBCs are now a farcical way to get you to do three jobs, get paid for half of one, and make sure you never get your bonus payout.\r\n\r\nAnd get used to centering your life around the premiere enterprise collaboration suite of the 1980's: Lotus Notes has its tentacles around everything IBM does. You will spend hours every week working around bugs and cleaning out e-mail inboxes so you won't go over your tiny storage quota.  You will be expected to do this nights and weekends.\r\n\r\nIf you are in sales (even sales engineering, like I was), you will be expected to spend four months in \"Global Sales School\", regardless of your past experience. It will be part of your PBCs and it will be like taking on another job in your evenings and weekends. You will learn the IBM way, since they are not the slightest bit interested in allowing your knowledge and experience to change the way they have done things for decades. Nevertheless, they will insist that this is \"an investment in you\" and it will of course take the place of any actual training that you need to do your job.\r\n\r\nEven the tiniest expense at IBM is now reviewed and re-reviewed and re-re-re-reviewed by layers upon layers of beancounters. You will not be able to travel even for client visits unless the expense was approved a quarter in advance. You will have to explain to your customer why you can't come out and talk about your product in person while your competition flies out and wins the deal.\r\n\r\nIBM is just not recruiting the top-notch talent any longer. My former boss resigned recently but not before he was getting laughed at by cold-called sales people and sales engineers to fill positions in IBM's cloud group, which is supposed to be their big investment area. You don't want to work with fifth-tier people who have nowhere else to go but IBM.\r\n\r\nMy advice to those looking to join IBM:\r\n-  Run away and run away fast. Have more respect for yourself.  But if you absolutely have no other choice ...\r\n-  Take the on-target earnings the recruiter offers and ask yourself if you can live on half of that. If you are on a 55/45% plan like I was (even as an engineer!) you will never see the other half of your paycheck (see PBCs above).\r\n-  Get used to spending late nights and weekends taking on work from your colleagues as they get laid off. You will not get paid for it.\r\n-  Try to convince yourself that the \"we'll do anything you want, just pay us money\" product approach is really a broad-based enterprise solution portfolio strategy.  IBM has no idea what products it should sell because it has no idea what it wants to be. Don't fall for the notion that \"cloud\" or \"cognitive analytics\" is a strategy. Their hybrid cloud go-to-market strategy is absurd and Watson is half-marketectured-vaporware, half-rebranded-Cognos. Remember, they've gone six years since \"Jeopardy\" with almost nothing to show for it.\r\n\r\nIn short, IBM was a great company and who knows, it may be yet again. But unless you are an incumbent and have an existing emotional investment in trying to turn it around, you have no reason to work yourself to death for terrible wages to help them out.

A lot of employees get promoted based on who they know and not what they know.  I have seen so many colleagues get passed up on promotions because the person that was hired knew someone at the top.  Executives and directors are constantly recommending kids and friends to jobs and they get hired, even if they may not be the best fit for the job.  A lot of college graduates of IBMer parents can get hired easily even if they are not the best fit.  College kids are getting hired into IBM and they make a lot more money than IBMers who have been at the company for 20 years, and then the college kids leave within 2 - 3 years.  \r\n\r\nIn my group, the managers would gossip about other employees and during PBC (annual review) time, those employees who kissed the most butt got the best ratings.  If you don't brag about yourself and complain about not getting a high rating, you won't get one.  Also, you just need to threaten to leave the company and you will get a high rating, you may not get more money, but you will get a high rating.  Managers are not proactive with the best employees in terms of praise, they react out of fear. Why should you threaten to leave before you get attention?\r\n\r\nThe best people who are humble and do good work get passed over for other loud mouth, over confident people who complain and threaten to leave the company if they don't get a raise and a high performance rating.\r\n\r\nDon't even bother looking for another position internally because you can't move between the different business groups (consulting to marketing or services to software sales, etc), there is a cap on the budget and most groups can only hire internally within the group, so if you are looking to get another job, it better be in your current business org or you can't move to another job.\r\n\r\nThe PBC (annual review) process is a joke (as explained above).  You will only get a top rating if you are friends with your manager, you kissed a lot of butt during the year, you complain about not getting enough money and recognition and you complain about how hard you worked during the year.\r\n\r\nSome of the top managers/executives just don't have time for you, everyone is just too busy.  My manager would cancel our monthly status meetings at the last minute and not offer to reschedule, so we never talked unless he had something urgent or wanted me to do something for him.\r\n\r\nGood people who do a good job are taken advantage of and expected to do more work than everyone else while the complainers don't get as much work.\r\n\r\nIf you are marked as a \"low performer\", your manager won't tell you until the end of the year and by that time, its too late to improve your performance and once you are named as a \"low performer\", your days are numbered and you are the list to be asked to leave IBM once it comes time for a round of layoffs, it doesn't matter how much you improve, once you are a low performer, you will always be seen as this.  I was a manager at one point during my career and I disagreed with this policy, its so disgusting.  I hated every bit of the performance process and wanted to praise all my employees for working hard and I was always forced to name 2 - 3 of the lowest performers on my team even though everyone on the team was strong.  How disgusting and horrible, what a way to make people feel good, right?\r\n\r\nI enjoyed a lot of colleagues I worked with, but I had to be careful of the people who gossiped or was looking to backstab you to make themselves look good.  Keep your personal life away from work because people will use it against you to say that you are not committed to work, especially if you have some personal issues you are dealing with.  \r\n\r\nIBM boasts getting a mentor but the top executives and managers are all too busy to mentor you.  During my time at IBM,  I had multiple mentors and at some point in time, they just got too busy and they didn't want to take a few minutes to talk, they would have their secretaries cancel the meetings and never respond to emails.  Oh and people at IBM don't respond to emails, you have to call them if you need something.\r\n\r\nExpect to be invited to long meetings that are pointless and drag on and on.  IBMers love to talk and hear themselves talk, so get ready to be invited to meetings where people just talk to talk, no goal or mission.  Always request information about the meeting to make sure you need to join, otherwise most meetings are just a waste of time or people sitting on the phone sharing gossip.\r\n\r\nI loved working at IBM at first but over the years, it is getting worse and worse and if IBM keeps hiring incompetent people, it will keep going downhill."}, {"review_title": "software client leader", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Ontario in Markham, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Comp plan is strong, and of course its a nice professional environment to work in.", "cons": "Selling the entire IBM software stack was a huge challenge.

Some examples:\r\n\r\nHave a question about your benefits?   Too bad, there's no HR department to contact.  Everything is \"self serve\".   The words \"self serve\" sound nice, right?  Almost like ice cream.  It really means you need to hunt for the information you're looking for, and once you find it, you spend hours trying to decipher the mumbo-jumbo that was obviously written by lawyers.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that my manager had an HR contact, but wasn't allowed to share that contact with me.  So there IS an HR department, but only managers get to use them.\r\n\r\nIBM software tools are a joke.  Why would any rational, intelligent mind contract a company that tries to market the steaming pile of garbage called \"Lotus Notes\"?  Seriously?  You're going to trust the company responsible for that abomination with your business needs?\r\n\r\nAnd please don't think that Lotus Notes was a fluke.  Oh, no!  IBM is the worst software company on Earth.  I need to use a billing system to account for my hours since I'm a consultant.  You should see the barely functional piece of java-junk I use to enter my hours.  You can't look billing codes up on it, the \"help\" button is non-functional, it's slow, the error messages are too cryptic to be useful, etc.\r\n\r\nThere was a traveling component to my job.  IBM, being the cheap Scrooge of business, has mandated that every single flight is done via coach / economy.  OK, I understand that a 1 hour flight from NY to DC hardly warrants the premium of business class.   How about a 6 hour flight to California?   Nope!  How about a 14 hour flight to Tokyo?  Nope!  Yeah, that's right.  I made 4 round trips to Tokyo -- that's 112 hours of flight -- cramped like some monkey on economy class.\r\n\r\nIf you're reading this, you're probably a professional.  Think about your office.  Does your company provide you with lunch?  snacks?  coffee?  soda?  water?  A damned paper napkin?  My office provides nothing.  Not even a measly paper napkin.  If I need to clean up a spill, I need to go to the men's room and wind toilet paper around my hand.   What company is so cheap that it doesn't even provide napkins to its employees?\r\n\r\nIBM's internal website is a joke.  Half the pages are non-functional, outdated, or non-helpful.   The internal phone system and it's associated website for messaging looks and feels like it was cobbled together by an old, bearded black-rimmed eyeglass wearing programmer from the 60's who still favors Fortran over C.\r\n\r\nI happen to make a decent salary, but that's only because IBM devoured my company, so I got shanghaied into IBM.  A person entering the company through the normal hiring process will make a crap salary.\r\n\r\nOur benefits are horrible, and many of the benefits they tout are useless pieces of garbage, like \"financial planning\".  Seriously?  Why would I need \"financial planning\"?  Instead of offering something that nobody would use, why not subsidize our health insurance a little more?   Instead of giving us access to \"Money Smart\" why not match our 401k contributions a little more?\r\n\r\nThere are little to no education benefits.  Oh, they'll do a good job making you think there are, but good luck collecting the money.\r\n\r\nIn short:\r\n\r\nWorking at IBM is humiliating and degrading.  It is a miserly company that acts like it's down on its luck and needs a dime today to buy a Kahuna burger on Tuesday.  Of course, a paycheck is better than no paycheck, so if you need to make a decision between IBM and homelessness, you should pick IBM.

After nine interviews I finally received an offer from a good boss and mentor.  However, after only 2 months this boss changed roles.  My new boss immediately assigned me a new sales territory.  My sales quota was $2 million annually.  After only being with IBM for 2 1/2 months, this boss called me, out of the blue, and assigned me a requirement to build a sales pipeline of $455,000 EVERY week!  This pipeline would equate to just under $24 million annually.  After our call he asked if I had any questions.  I asked two questions.  First, the weekly pipeline requirement seemed high, does anyone else who works in my role have this high of a weekly pipeline requirement?  Secondly, how can you justify a pipeline so high to a new employee?  The answers I received were the following.  To the first question the response was you are a very experienced sales person and you should be able to build the pipeline.  To the second question the response was you are responsible for achieving the pipeline and if you don't you will be let go.  As an additional comment, I sold deals after only three months on the job, but my new boss did not care of even mention the sales success that I had achieved.  At first I built the $455,000 per week pipeline.  One week was only four days, because of a holiday and I did not achieve the $455,000 pipeline goal.  My boss called me with a human resource employee, who had only recently graduated college and was new to Human Resources.  The call informed me I had three weeks left of employment and then  I would be let go.  Another side note, my bosses, second line manager had a meeting to discuss cleaning up our sales pipeline and ensuring that deals put into our CRM were true deals and realistic.  My problem was I needed to add $455,000 in pipeline every week or lose my job.  I also called my peers, in the same role and asked if they had ever heard of a pipeline requirement of $455,000 per week.  Every sales peer I spoke with stated that is an unattainable pipeline requirement. In short, I was let go for not achieving my weekly pipeline requirement.  My former boss still works for IBM.

Their insulated company culture is full of employees who are used to being told how to think and not to question authority and uses excessive inside company jargon \"newspeak\" & recursive acronyms automatically assuming that you know what they're talking about without defining what they mean and most of their own employees don't even know what they mean. After you experience the friendly New Hire Employee Orientation Phase the first week and then begin the torutuos Employee Training phase the 2nd week where the \"Trainers\" teach in a very egocentric narrow-minded mannaer you're subjected to being treated like a child who shouldn't talk back to their parents in a military boot camp atmosphere that uses fear and intimidation as motivational techniques like you're a child back in grammar school. After I one day apparently asked too many questions in a training seminar I was taken to a private room by 2 of the trainers who asked me for feedback about how I thought that I was doing. At the end, 1 of the trainers menacingly said to me, \"I'm watching you!\". If you offer suggestions to them, their attitude is, \"Why talk about things like that because IBM is never go to change anyway!\". You even sometimes attend \"Lunch & Learn\" classroom  training where  you can't even take a real lunch break away from the training; but must endure stomach indigestion during your training session lunch breaks. Even though they say that they openly solicit questions & comments during the Training Phase I don't recommend speaking up too much to them otherwise you will let them know that you have an open mind and can actually think for yourself and aren't going to blindly swallow their company business culture.I was hired by IBM to be a Field Services Representative by an IBM Service Delivery Manager and began work on April 22, 2013 and rushed out too fast to their Training Class in Boulder, Colorado after only 1 week where most of the other trainees have already been out in the field for over 1 month or more. After arriving at the Hyatt House in Boulder, Colorado, I couldn't even access the WiFi Access Point or the IBM Intranet with their company supplied IBM ThinkPad, even though I could access the WiFi Access Point with my own Dell Notebook Computer. I called the IBM Help Desk and the Hyatt House Help Desk and neither one could figure out why or help me. when I mentioned this to my trainers, they didn't help me either; but they told me that I was supposed to \"take ownership of the problem\". I finally figured out how to access the IBM Intranet from the Hyatt House Hotel in Boulder, Colorado after 3 days; but I was already too far behind the rest of the other trainees and didn't even pass the first test that was administered after 1 week. One of the conditions for qualifying for this job was to relocate from where I was previously living in Binghamton, New York to Syracuse, New York. I agreed to do this and I asked my manager if I could be compensated for my moving expenses; but he replied no. I moved into my Syracuse, New York apartment located at High Acres Apartments & Townhouses after signing a 1 year lease paying $965/month on Saturday May 26, 2013 to Memorial Day, Monday, May 28, 2013 with my manager's approval. On June 7, 2013, my manager informed me that he was terminating my employment with IBM because he didn't think that I would fit into the \"IBM Business Culture\". I informed my landlord's leasing office immediately; but they told me I wasn't able to break the 1 year lease unless I moved out immediately. I asked my former landlord at High Acres Apartments in Binghamton, New York if I could move back to my former apar tment; but they said that I couldn't because I was now unemployed. Now I'm obligated to pay High Acres Apartments & Townhouses in Syracuse, New York 12 months x $965/month =  $11,580.  I am only receiving $268/week from the US Department of Labor EUC (Emergency Unemployment Compensation) Program. Is that a nice way to treat new employees right after attending their New Employee IBM Orientation and Training? Now I know why Bill Gates once  turned down a job working at IBM in Endicott, New York. IBM abandoned the city that put them on the global map too, so that should tell you what your hard work for this company will get you - a \"pink slip.

With their stock grants, they have all made tens of millions of dollars.  Revenues are declining quarterly, yet they still get the big bucks.

If you are young and can't find another job, then by all means work there, get some experience and get out as soon as possible.

Now many of those people are losing their jobs. The executives in charge should be subject to the same unfair rating scale as the rank and file. \r\n\r\nSalary increases are nonexistent. Only the top performers can quality for annual bonuses, and the pool of top performers shrinks every year because the rating system is flawed, so the bonus remains out of reach for the majority of people, despite successfully taking on more and more responsibility.\r\n\r\nThere is no opportunity or incentive for external training or continuing education to develop new skills, unless it comes out of your own pocket.

IBM matches the first 5% of eligible pay contributed to your 401(k).", "cons": "As many people do, I became an IBMer by way of acquisition.  Having been part of IBM for nearly three years, the transition has been everything but smooth.  My team once used five (5) non-IBM applications to complete the responsibilities of our role.  IBM has done away with all of them, and replaced what used to be five (5) applications with eight (8) applications, none of which have been deemed more efficient compared to the former.\r\n\r\nSince the acquisition, every C-level incumbent that existed with our legacy company has left.  While I realize they likely got paid a handsome amount to leave, the general population has experienced little improvement to the overall job/career experience.  IBM forces managers to (subjectively) rank their team, giving each of them a certain amount of superior rankings to assign.  Therefore, if you have a small team of high-performers who all work hard to accomplish their given initiatives, the manager will still have to rank some higher than others.  This affects the likelihood of any raise or advancement of those ranked lower.  \r\n\r\nThe General Manager of our part of the business is regularly asking us, the general population, to do more, sell more, save nickels and dimes wherever we can.  However, from the history of the past two (2) years, I have seen only a select few people improve their situation financially or career-wise, whereas the majority of people are just considered fortunate to not be laid off, or \"resourced\" as IBM refers to it.  I have seen many talented people, who are much more valuable to the business than I am, be laid off after over a decade of dedicated service to our legacy company.  The idea of \"just keep doing a great job and you'll be fine\" doesn't really hold true here.  While my manager, my clients and my teammates all have told me that I'm great at my job, I don't feel as though I have any more job security than the next person in line.  IBM employees are literally just a six-digit serial number with a salary (cost) behind it.  Every year, I wonder if it will be my number that will be called, or perhaps one of my teammates who also gives a great deal of who they are to their clients, projects and team.\r\n\r\nDespite multiple years of negative overall results to the Employee Engagement Survey that has been administered to employees by the company, there has been little (if any) change to the things that the employees have cited as areas that could be improved.  If any change has been implemented, it has yet to show up in my daily routine.\r\n\r\nI have seen IBM lay off people of great talent and influence, while promoting others that have no business being in a leadership position over a given area.  They have no ability to actually manage people, but were moved into a position of influence to do so.  \r\n\r\nMy direct team was comprised of six (6) people in January 2015.  Today we are down to three 3).  All that have departed have left the company voluntarily, some for lower-paying positions, but with better morale and quality of life.  Two (2) of the remaining three (3) are also looking for new opportunities.\r\n\r\nThough we have seen approximately 10% of our workforce laid off over the past two years, the CEO has still managed to pocket a multi-million dollar bonus each year... and this is what you call \"leadership\"?"}, {"review_title": "Seen better times", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "10 Aug 2015", "job_title": "IT Solutions Architect in S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Global company, many opportunities in different areas.

Business\r\n- IBM is reinventing itself from a technology perspective, driving new areas in cloud, big data & analytics, mobile, IoT (Internet of Things) & cognitive.\r\n\r\n2. Brand\r\n- Internationally recognized brand\r\n\r\n3. Culture\r\n- Good work life balance....but (please see Cons).\r\n- Good application of social media/technology for communication e.g. blogs, Sametime chat\r\n\r\n4. Organization\r\n- Strong pool of talents distributed globally e.g. SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) available for sales support, customer workshops, projects etc.\r\n- Project managers generally gives you the autonomy to work independently, and generally supportive to fresh graduates.\r\n\r\n5. Compensation & Benefits\r\n- Benefits are quite generous. Employees get a \"Blue Benefits\" card to access 2000 kr worth of benefits from healthcare to gym, shopping etc.\r\n\r\n6. Others\r\n- Very good library of knowledge portal", "cons": "1. Business\r\n- Despite shifting to new technologies and significant investments (globally, not locally in Sweden), exposure to these projects are very very limited. \r\n\r\n2. Brand\r\n- Brand is losing its appeal since few years ago. \r\n\r\n3. Culture\r\n- Very selfish culture. Most people are only looking after themselves. No one speaks to you or introduce themselves even if they are sitting next to you. You can sometimes be in the office the whole day(s) without speaking a word to anyone!\r\n- Extremely slow if you are looking for a project or idle (waiting on the bench). When in projects, most managers leave early but asks you to work late shifts... sometimes even on the weekend.\r\n- Senior management is detached from the employees and very old-school thinking (don't be fooled by their speeches on vision, design thinking etc...)\r\n- Despite the use of social media to aid communication, many IBMers (especially managers and above) do not respond UNLESS they are the ones who initiated the dialogue. The managers are only interested to respond if they need something from you. \r\n\r\n4. Organization\r\n- Despite the strong pool of talents/SMEs, (1) they are usually not accessible or have a habit of not responding; (2) most local IBM offices stick to their own pool of resources strictly - which means that cross-border projects can be very difficult except of \"very cheap\" fresh graduates.\r\n- Almost all managers are not interested in you! There is a system where people need to meet the requirement of \"managerial skills\" before getting promoted - although this is fair and good, these people are allocated into managerial roles/shifts, and there are only interested in meeting that requirement for promotion or KPI target. They do not have proper managerial training, poor counseling skills, and does not even take ownership in tracking your career progression.\r\n- A lot of very good and talented people have left IBM. That said, many of these managers stay away until a few days before your departure to have an exit interview... asking why you are leaving!!\r\n\r\n5. Compensation & Benefits\r\n- Although good benefits, the internal process to obtain them is just ridiculous! This includes travel expense reports.\r\n- Compensation is not generous, unless you know how to negotiate. Increments and bonus is almost non-existent, despite promises during interviews.\r\n\r\n6. Others\r\n- Very poor and expensive food in the restaurant\r\n- Building is very old and the furniture are poor (broken chairs and tables left around). If the council had not approved a new plan to convert the IBM building to a school campus, IBM would have continued to stay in this rotten building!"}], [{"review_title": "Transitioning to a new kind of company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "22 Nov 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Taunusstein", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Aggressively building capacity in new, upcoming technology areas (Software labs)", "cons": "Parts of the company may still be legacy, with people who reached tech leadership positions without much depth or ability to groom others - though there appears to be effort to change this  now."}, {"review_title": "Lots of benefits, a little bit boring", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Dec 2016", "job_title": "Territory Sales Representative in Buenos Aires", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of benefits, very professional.

Since many of the accounts IBM has have been around for such a long time you can trust that the code base will be such a nightmare to maintain that its level of complexity and quagmire of IBM proprietary software will be the only reason the company has not already ditched it for something better.  Compensation is very low for the amount of work you will be performing and your manager will be so busy with their own projects and managing all the other people under them (40+ people) that they will have no clue what you actually do ... or even what project you are on.  The promotion and performance measuring system are both a total joke... there is nothing personal about it you fill in some forms and have a talk with your manager...  who again, knows nothing of what you do.  Utilization is the word of the day and in the end all that matters to IBM is how much money you can pry from the customer\u2019s pocket book.  Lotus Notes is absolute garbage and you will have to use it every day.  IBM is in the middle of a social transformation and trying to become more like Twitter, Facebook and the like.  We are forced into using new social media type applications by integrating them into project work flow\u2026 it does not work out well.  There are many other complaints that I have about IBM but explaining them to people outside the company would take much more room than I have in this small amount of space but the bottom line is that IBM is the Titanic and the captain just ordered the engine room all ahead full seemingly oblivious to the icebergs.
