How can you confront the manager that your likable is not working with full integrity? What managers will do is that they select a few individual as an unofficial lead and now you have to dance to whatever tune they play. You even cannot raise the question against them. They will decide what story you work on and how many points will be assigned to this story. You have become puppets and dance to their rhythm. Forget about changing the project as your manager will not easily let you go and hr is just a name.
