But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company. \r\n1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.).  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. \r\n2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business. \r\n3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.", "cons": "1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the \"normal distribution\" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%), above average contributor (15%), average contributor (~75%), and bottom contributor (5%).  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being \"average contributors\" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors. \r\n\r\n2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent \"above average\" rating in the last 4-5 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary.  Were I rated \"average contributor\" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.\r\n\r\nFrom talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower. \r\n\r\n3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams. \r\n\r\n4. Poor top down communication about company's and divisions' future.

Which affects all of the workers they hired during the pandemic that might need to relocate to a really expensive city like Guadalajara. In Guadalajara the company site is located way outside of the city. Meaning you waste up to 2 and a half hours commuting to and from the office.

We instead depend on a lot of internal tools to get and give feedback on performance. Communication with our clients and managers is largely left up to us (with guidance), and the feedback from our managers is what is tantamount in our reviews. 2. Work load balance: gone are the days where I have too many reqs to handle. And because I'm assigned to a particular skill set within a business unit, I am able to hone in on my talent pool and also dig in deep to a skill set to get to know. I'm also able to move around, so the skill sets I am exposed to gets broader and deeper the longer I'm here. 3. Education access: IBMers tend to stick around because of the ability to learn entirely new skills through the robust and large internal education program. If your dream is to do something other than your job down the road, there's plenty of opportunity to learn brand-new skills--even learning to code! It's really up to you as an individual to choose your path within IBM.", "cons": "1. The lack of bonuses year over year is a killer when trying to recruit candidates from outside IBM. Even with our best year yet for our shareholders, we will not be seeing competitive bonus incentives. 2. Return to office push: can we please just give up on this? I understand that it is a huge change due to real estate that is owned, but employee retention and satisfaction is much higher when we allow folks to work from home. The pressure to return to office is also much higher on the softer (\"easier to replace\") skill sets, so this pressure is leveraged against your lower banded positions, where higher banded and more niche skills get much more leeway. 3. Compensation ratings for some cities are just wrong. Austin should not be at a \"national\" market level, given our rising cost of living pushing many employees out of the city center. Although leadership may be paid to live in the city center, your professional banded positions are not paying enough to be able to live close to the office, or to purchase property within the city."}, {"review_title": "Flexible, but no fun", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "17 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Business Transformation Consultant in Copenhagen, Capital Region", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "IBM offers great flexibility and the access to training is unseen anywhere else.

Leads and managers don\u2019t even know how to manage proper resources in proper place. You would be randomly assigned in a project where you will be randomly asked to work in any skillset no matter from what background you belong. For example a dev might be directly assigned with a devops work all of a sudden, without any training or KT, A SDET might be assigned to development all of a sudden without KT, an SDE assigned to manual testing all of a sudden and then again a change from that role to another role in the next sprint. Now if they are unable to perform they will be abused by some managers saying \u201cyou should learn and grow\u201d. Let me tell this thing, \u201clearn and grow\u201d means learn new technology in your technology domain not change of domains all of a sudden and then again a change in the next 3 months. One will end up in becoming Jack of all trades but \u201cMaster of None\u201d. Change is good but not from sprint to sprint. No salary hikes, you will retire with the same CTC with which you joined Team management and team structure is the poorest I have ever seen. Worst than a lot of small start up companies even. Unstructured projects, managers think about short term goals only. Almost no managers know what is the role of \u201cSDET\u201d but they hired SDET. Alas !!!!!
