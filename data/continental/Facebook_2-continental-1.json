To understand some of the problems a little history is necessary. This was a local Lidar company in Santa Barbara (ASC) that Continental bought. Continental is a big international company, but you get a feeling that the German colleagues are preferred over others (look at the board members and you get an idea) so of course a bunch of German engineers/managers who were eager for promotions were sent to this location for the transition. The cultural gap really didn't help during the transition period and there were problems right off the bat. The original engineers that really knew the technology hated how things were, to a point that just after a year the main hardware guys from ASC all quit so I'm not sure how the next generations of this lidar sensor would be successfully developed.\r\n\r\nThe upper management at Continental is eager to ship all the jobs it can to countries where they don't have to pay as much money and you are told that your salary is too high compared to them so this is justified. In the time I've been at conti, I've seen most of the hardware/software components shipped out to other places for the sake of saving money on paper. Most of these places are on different time zones with some not having any overlapping working hours. To make things worse, you have no power over the other teams in other countries as they have other bosses and also other tasks from other branches. This creates an incredibly inefficient system, where it takes forever to get something done, and when it's done it better not have any bugs/issues because resolving them takes even longer. So you end up tracking other people's work, and conti has actually created a lot of positions specifically for this reason, track what others do and bug them until they do it. A lot of smart people who were hired to do real work are used for this, and you can see that they are not happy about it and are already looking elsewhere for employment including myself. The management has mentioned that this is Conti's most expensive branch to keep open so I really wonder how long more it will be here once all the components can be done elsewhere. I really would not recommend this branch to anyone. I can go on and on about the problems but this should be enough to help smart candidates stay away. Too bad the top managers at this branch don't even care as they are on temporary expat contracts so they can just go back to where they came from, or to another branch where they can focus on collecting their big bonuses while it lasts."}, {"review_title": "Great corporate culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Timi\u015foara", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- The organization is well balanced, you can find support in every aspect of your daily work;\r\n- Many efforts to connect all the employees, together with their ideas;\r\n- Good development equipment, the majority of tools are the best in their category;\r\n- Multicultural experience.", "cons": "- Being a large company is hard to work on innovation;\r\n- Also because of the size, there is the general feeling that decisions propagate slowly;\r\n- Beyond skills you need a lot of time in the company to access roles that involve more responsibility."}, {"review_title": "A great place to learn the ins and outs of the automotive business outside of Detroit.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Jan 2009", "job_title": "Senior Mechanical Engineer in Deer Park, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A great place for an Automotive engineer to work outside of the Detroit area.

Workforce Commission website. DO NOT apply in person at the facility.  Front door security personnel will direct you to their contracted temporary staffing agency.  If hired by the temp/staffing agency,  your starting pay will be only $10/hr. and way below par benefits.  Then you try to work hard to get converted to Continental to realize the $2.50 hourly increase and much better benefits.  I've seen a very small percentage of people get converted rather quickly, 2-3 months.  But most take several months which adds up to a substantial sum plus a possible forfeiture of one of the annual bonuses every April.  My conversion took 9 months costing me thousands of dollars in pay and bonuses.   Even though I worked as hard or harder than everyone else on my line,  I still lost several thousand dollars just because I did not know about applying directly with Continental on the Texas Workforce Commission website.  I know one individual who quit a week after being hired by the temp staffing agency and immediately applied directly on the TWC website.  Good for him he was hired by Continental.  I thought about doing that while waiting for my conversion but I errantly believed there was a 6 month waiting period before being able to apply directly.  The 12 hour day, 2 days on 2 days off 3 days on 2 days off 2 days on 3 days off work schedule is setup so that hourly production associates work 6 months out of the year, while still averaging 40 hrs per week.   But 12 hour days on your feet get tiresome with no opportunity to sit, other than breaks, in most production departments.  Hourly production rates can be more difficult to attain depending on your department/product line.  Current hourly starting rate is $12.50/hr.  Unless you are single and live with your parents or have another wage-earner in your household, the starting rate pretty much mandates getting a second /part-time job if you're unable to get over-time approved every pay period.

I had many wonderful experience while working there for quite a while. I owe Continental a lot for my professional growth. It really was an awesome place to work until recently.

It stood for something and help drive a healthy culture. I do want to give Conti some credit before starting into the cons because they really used to be a great company that stood for something. Unfortunately, those good time were over with a sharp turn to downward spiral lane for employees.", "cons": "Unfortunately, Continental has become so large, it has not found a decent corporate integration strategy. Information certainly stops at a certain level. In the last 5 years I was there, disconnection between groups and specifically business units led without any guidance, which then turned to management crushing anyone to get ahead. In addition, Continental is impregnated with processes that get processed by additional processes, that in the last 3 years, it crippled output. In the last group, I had the most self-serving manager I ever experienced, who in the first month of starting in the group, told me that I could not use exclamation points in my emails, as it didn't reflect well on him. A sign that it's going to get worse, and it did. But, I stand in constant applause that he was able to get his promotion. Lastly, all of the sudden going from a decent balanced HR policy, it suddenly became a tumor. Employee retention policy is in order to get your earned bonus for the previous year, you had to work for almost 6 months into the new year to get the previous years bonus. At that point, you earned half of this years bonus. You quit 1 hour before that date, you relinquish any earned bonus, not just that year, but the entire previous year. Amazingly clever, yet lacking a soul and zero care in those managing and delivering all their assets. Even better, Continentals HR policy for advancement. Quit, go to another company for a year, then come back with a 20% raise for the same job you did before. Otherwise, you'll get your 20%, just installments of 1%  per year, for the next 20 years. But don't worry, it's all in some document somewhere, just not accessible. I eventually researched on and off about 2 months to find one policy I had a question about. I've been told that there might be a pay-scale reference per job, but I was told, by HR, that this is not information we can access. It's just a bit sad that a new-hire, with much less experienced is valued with a much higher salary, just to bring him onboard. It never bothered me, but gave me a perspective on what Continental values in their people. Do what you can until it becomes illegal approach. Maybe that's how things are now-adays. But, it's also the reason I left unfortunately, after almost 20 years. But hey, they took me to lunch. It was scribbled into a lunch for a new employee hire, I just love it. I still have friends there, so please Conti, stop acquiring businesses and fix some internal employee issues.

And they will give you really variety confusing benefits that make you think you'll earn more in final. That's fake. Never trust them.\r\n\r\n2. Vague goals. At beginning, they open a division called intelligent transpiration system (ITS) as a start up without any ideas. But they think they can open a billion business because they have a really large base company in the world. But the reality is that base company becomes real obstacle in your regular life. For example, when you try to use some cloud service as in other company. The engineer can choose any cloud server they want to (AWS GC etc.) But in this magic company, you have to write a report that explains why you need AWS rather than other cloud provider to the a department. They will take 2 months (even longer) to decide if this is right. Even a USB cable. You cannot buy it directly. But the base company always wants this division has more and more revenue.  Then the management fake everything.\r\n\r\n3. They only  hire politician  in their management team. Your boss only care about if he can pass the review. And if he cannot pass the review, then you will become the unlucky guy.  My ever two old co-workers, they just left the college as a new college grad engineer. But they left company, cause they don't have enough performance after they join team 4 or 5 months. And they almost didn't get any tutoring and help when they were in the team. When one of that coworkers find a new job, he even told me, he was really afraid to ask questions in new team. And his new teammates cannot understand why he is so shame to ask questions lol.\r\n\r\n4. Bad culture. Because this is a fake start up. Everybody's work will not influence their final salary. Then there is no co-work, no communication in the team. No body knows how to compromise in the work.

This is especially true when priorities are not clearly laid out.  \r\n\r\nMore importantly, the dependencies of the project have not been thought through.  You can start working on a task and ask about components/resources you realise you will need and be told that they are coming (documentation is one good example - no documentation available - or, well, maybe the stubs of documentation - e.g., headers of the documentation but no relevant information but you have to use the component - it turns out that the component itself is still evolving - which is why the documentation is still in its infancy).\r\n\r\nTools are changed with no warning, no training, no explanation.  The only time you realise that there is a new tool is when you've been put on a mailing list and get updates about it - you may not even know what the point of the tool is, what it's meant to be used for or which teams are using the tool - are you getting notifications because you have been assigned to a task/project or is it because someone has decided that at some point you may need to use the tool or work on that task?).\r\n\r\nThere seems to be some power struggles between management.  it is not uncommon for questions that you had thought resolved gets brought up a few weeks later by another manager (they will argue that it's in the context of a different project - but then something has failed if a generic component is not generic enough to be used in more than one project - or if the projects who have dependencies on a specific components have not coordinated to make sure that work does not have to be done 3, 4, 5, or more times).\r\n\r\nMy recent favorite was a discussion where an engineer was told to go ahead making certain assumptions as there was a meeting the following day to sort out most of the questions.  Is there really not enough work that the task cannot be put on hold for 24-48 hours while the uncertainties are resolved to avoid going up the wrong path or doubling work?  Or is this a recognition that for all the talk nothing is going to be resolved?  Or is this a preemptive strike to force other stakeholders to be committed to one vision of how a component is to be designed/implemented?\r\n\r\nIn any case, the word I can say is 'chaos'....absolute and utter chaos.  \r\n\r\nStandups are regularly moved around to suit the schedules of the scrum masters (or deputy scrum masters) rather than sticking with the concept of standups being fixed to help develop the communication pattern that is needed.
