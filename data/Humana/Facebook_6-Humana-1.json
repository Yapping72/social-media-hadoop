They have tenets like \u201crethink routine\u201d and \u201cpioneer simplicity\u201d but that only applies if your manager likes you, doesn\u2019t matter if you have a good idea or know best practices. \n\nWork life balance should be good because the enforce 8-5 pairing 5 days a week but in reality if you don\u2019t work outside those hours it will be held against you. Also trying to build complex products chained to another person is comical. Everyone is treated like children.\n\nCompensation is low since the company is run by accountants. 401k match is solid, but pay is way low and the health benefits packages (their own coverage) is awful, it\u2019s expensive and covers almost nothing. Super common for employees to tell other new employees to use their partners benefits. No RSUs, so ESPP, and your bonus is entirely subjective to one person (not your performance).\n\nCompany culture here is nonexistent to straight up toxic. Managers have little to no training and it shows. Heavy micromanagement at all levels. Their culture is \u201cpair programming and extreme programming\u201d like it\u2019s the 90s. Culture varies from manager to manager but if you don\u2019t conform to exactly what that specific manager wants it will be used against you. \n\nThe most important part I think is the fact that several racist incidents occurred in the presence of other employees and with the acknowledgment from management and the division.

You will find yourself doing six positions above your grade but earning the same entry-level pay for your titled position. It's still a little like the old buddy club in some areas, and all about who you know. Open positions are rarely announced publicly or not at all for your department; you have to constantly reach out to other departments/managers or the HR application to find advance positions. (With all the work, you rarely have time to do a job search.) Communication and inclusion of work at home (pre-COVID) still needs to be tweaked. Opportunities are given more to associates in house than remote, even though remote work is now the norm. Micro-managing comes into play a lot for remote, and other team members are overlooked even when they consistently have little to no production. Remote work requires more skill because of the independent self-motivation and problem solving needed to work remote.

During that time I would say the main selling points were as follows: the culture, work life balance, the Actuarial Study Program, and Rotational Program. The actuarial leadership team makes a very hard attempt to not only expose you to a variety of areas, but also ensure that you have the opportunity to properly network amongst your peers at a variety of different leadership levels. Compared to the study programs I have seen, theirs is very rich and has incredibly fair guidelines. I am very thankful that I came across this company very early on in my career - for it  kicked off my career as an actuary.", "cons": "Rotational Program - yes this is a PRO as well as a CON. First of all participation in the program is required (aka non-optional), so if you are in a role that you love and you are selected by leadership to rotate, you have to do so. Secondly, while the purpose of the rotational program is to expose you to a variety of areas, that doesn't always seem to be what happens. Not only is the program extremely political amongst leadership - but some departments will keep strong talent to themselves and rotate that talent internally as opposed to opening up those positions to everyone in the company. And you have very little say about where you end up. So your best bet is to network yourself like crazy with leadership and the rotational committee to ensure you are given a decent posting. \r\n\r\nNon-Competitive Salaries - This is a very common problem in many insurance companies. Unless you are a \"favorite\" it does not pay to be loyal and become a \"lifer.\" I have seen employees leave for a much higher salary, do a year at a competitor where they passed no exams, then return to Humana at that heightened salary. Personally I'd rather they simply offer more competitive salaries than make their talent quit and return to attain competitive pay. \r\n\r\nLack of Ability to Permanently Work From Home (Pre COVID 19)- While some departments are flexible in allowing team members to work from home after an initial trial period of working in the office, not all are open to this arrangement - which in turn limits not only the opportunities available to you, but it also makes it easier to depart the company once your accreditations are complete. In this day and age, it is very easy to find a company that will support you as fully remote associate so if anything this restriction is hurting the company more than helping  it.\r\n\r\nInability to Get Promoted Without ASA Credentials - Again this is something I have seen in several insurance companies however over the past decade or so it has been a policy that has evolved in other companies but not yet Humana. The truth of the matter is if you do not attain your ASA, then regardless of the quality of your work you cannot be promoted or be compensated accordingly. It is an unfortunate rule that has been enforced for years that shows no indication of changing. Your skillset is still highly valued, but until those accreditations are attained at a minimum, you will not payed or promoted accordingly."}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Business Analyst in Omaha, NE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome bennies and treatment of associates.", "cons": "Great company to work for.

I continued to receive emails after I had already started at Humana and was 2-4 weeks in to my new role stating that my background check was still taking place and that I could be terminated. How can you allow a person to start there if you haven't completed their background check? Worse yet, Sterling (the third party Humana uses) continues to notify you after you have already started and tells you that you can be terminated?! That's a fantastic way to welcome new people to the company...Truly awful experience. I was notified that my background check was finally completed after I was a month and half into my new role. Once you start there is one new hire call, but as far as on-boarding that is it and you are on your own from there. If you are designated Work At Home/remote worker they send you your equipment in a big box and you are on your own to get everything setup and get all the software and programs you will need for your role. It took a month for someone in IT to give me security clearance so that I could put email on my iphone. Make sure you do some extra homework and reach out to folks on linkedin and ask questions about the team you will be on, the manager of the team/your boss, and your role. Working at Humana is all about having the right manager. If your manager does not like you they can fire you within the first 90-120 day Appraisal Period and without much oversight from HR & minimal communication to you directly - it is awful. This was not clearly communicated to me when I accepted the position - see note above on terrible onboarding experience. Additionally you will be marked ineligible for rehire, aka blacklisted forever from working at Humana and there is literally nothing you can do about it. If you want to file a complaint against your manager then you contact HR, they have you fill out a Resolving Conflict form, and then you have to give it to your manager! HR has a very hands-off role during this process. Essentially, if you end up with an awful manager you are stuck with either letting them terminate you, or you can completely ruin your relationship with them by filing a claim with HR - in hindsight this is the better route rather than being terminated in the first 90-120 days during the \"Appraisal Period\" and being \"ineligible for re-hire\""}], [{"review_title": "Best Company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 May 2021", "job_title": "Care Management Support Assistant II in Green Bay, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Hour of well-being time to use a week\r\n\r\nEmployees treated very well\r\n\r\nYearly bonuses", "cons": "None that I have came across"}, {"review_title": "Awesome company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Senior STARS Improvement Professional in West Palm Beach, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome 401K match, great benefits, flexible schedules, & PTO", "cons": "I can't think of any."}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Company leadership displays that they care about both employees and members.", "cons": "I haven't experienced any downsides."}, {"review_title": "Major", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits and a great company culture.", "cons": "Things were just too excellent."}, {"review_title": "Enjoy my roll", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "23 May 2021", "job_title": "Accounting Lead in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great environment and place to work.
