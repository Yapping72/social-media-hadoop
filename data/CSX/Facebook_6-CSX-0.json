Remote positions are offering higher salaries for professionals. Along with the higher salaries, remote employees do not have to pay for gas. Individuals working in the office are indirectly making lower salaries than people working remotely due to gas. Office employees are also losing 1-2 hours a day to commuting which is unnecessary. This amounts to almost a full extra week of work (just in drive time) that we are dedicating to our employer. This has a huge impact on lifestyle.

Of course a business needs to be profitable, but leadership only cares about big their dividend will be of of their shares, or their end of year bonus. Leadership often uses meaningless jargon to make it seem like not giving employees a raise or reducing bonus potential is actually a good thing. IT leadership specifically is full of conniving individuals lording over their fiefdom. They prefer to play corporate politics, rather than properly leading and mentoring their teams. The business partners have little regard for technology, which strains the relationship when trying to build solutions.\r\n\r\nCSX tends to promote individuals to their highest-level of incompetence (Peter Principle). This results in managers and project managers who have no idea how to lead, nor proper understanding of their domain. You can actually leverage this to your advantage as an outside hire. I saw numerous individuals talk their way into technical roles, when they clearly could not do the work. They just delegated their work away and blamed others when things were done incorrectly. That said, certain individuals like this are protected by their bosses and HR. Leadership would rather keep an ineffectual PM/Mgr in place, than admit they made a bad hire. If you follow the ethics process and report issues, as instructed, with evidence, you will be outed and punished for not being a team player.\r\n\r\nOn the topic of promotion, because there's many incompetent individuals in senior positions, you'll be hard pressed to be promoted. Leadership tends to promote those who they hand-select and groom into loyalty. You'll see certain individuals quickly skip pay bands and positions, while you and your teammates are told you need to follow specific track; that there are no promotions available. If you apply for an internal transfer/promotion, there's a good likelihood that your manager will sandbag your interview if they don't fully condone your team change.\r\n\r\nIf you're a high-performer, you will be heavily relied upon to carry your team. Yes, you should be a team player, but you should not be expected to cover for senior teammates who consistently drop the ball.\r\n\r\nThere's a reason IT has such high turnover. There's a reason why the overwhelming majority of my training class left the company.

Most of the management are straight out of college with no experience in railroading however expect you to respect their authority and like to think they know how the railroad operates when in truth they are clueless. 2. They are out to fire you. Why would that be you may ask? Let me outline it for you. The government pays them subsidies for hiring the American worker. They then train you and make you believe you have just started a wonderful career and that you will be here for a very long time. Neglecting to tell you that most likely you will be furloughed the first day you are done with your training. You could be furloughed up to a full year and all the while CSX has made money off the government while you sit around hoping to get called again. They pretty much bank on the fact that you most likely will not return. This however helps them look good to the public and their shareholders for all PR purposes to look like they are helping the Economy and hiring people. It makes it look like they  are doing so much business that they have to hire new people. The management is actually told to write people up. That they have written the rule books so that there is no way that the employee can ever be 100 percent rule compliant. 3. Your family life will be non existent. The divorce rate on the railroad is through the roof. Since joining the railroad it has been a struggle just to keep my marriage afloat. My son hates me and my daughter cries all the time because I'm never Home! I've missed two thanksgivings and one Christmas so far. I've missed my anniversary 4 times and all of my sons ball games. This company does nothing to help you on this matter and could care less. Again you are nothing but a number. The only reason people stay here is for the retirement. The railroad is nothing like what it use to be. It's only about the dollar. Corporate greed at its finest with CSX. This year, we have been told that due to Hurricane Isaac we will not be getting our yearly bonus, however Mr. Micheal Ward, the company CEO got his bonus of over 9 million dollars. Way to care about your employees Mr. Ward. Again There are entirely too many to list here but i can assure you that the cons FAR outweigh the pros You have to ask yourself whats important in you life and if you are ready to sacrifice all that for a bunch of empty promises.

Some come with the job because of the 24/7 service requirements.  Let's face it, about 2/3 of the U.S. economy travels by rail.  Management will provide the rest of the problems. First, though pay is very good in the end, you will spend a great deal of time with payroll, labor relations and your union rep trying to get properly paid for your work. The carrier does not honor agreed work rules and accurate payroll is a constant struggle. Second, due to the management structure you are treated as the enemy not a team member by local and middle management. Almost all infractions carry suspension time from seven to thirty days. You are offered \"job insurance\" that will help you pay bills while you miss work after being disciplined. Only job I know of where this is needed.  You arrive everyday wondering if you will have a job when you get off because when ANYTHING goes wrong, accountability ends with you. Management is almost never responsible for mistakes.  The attitude is basically, \"How can we put this on the transportation employee?\" CSX has thousands of work rules that are engineered to be impossible to follow at a 100% level. This way local management can intimidate you to speed up to unsafe levels in order to meet their performance numbers and easily punish you when you fail or refuse to put their production requirements ahead of safety. The Union tries to fight this daily but the reality is that Railroad Unions have very little power or influence anymore. Third, your life will revolve around the railroad. You will work almost all holidays, nights, weekends, birthdays, etc., etc. Attendance policy is barbaric at best as absence is only excused by way of Urgent care facility or Hospital Emergency room. Literally! Almost everyone in this department has divorced at least once and the lack of schedule will eliminate any possibility of child custody.  You will struggle to spend time with family and friends even if you are able to hold things together throughout your career. Your fellow employees will be your family and friends because they are the only ones who will understand."}, {"review_title": "Love Csx but not the politcs", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Mar 2015", "job_title": " in Jacksonville, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay, benefits, hard working  people", "cons": "Work/life balance don't  really  exists"}, {"review_title": "conductor", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Aug 2017", "job_title": "Railroad Conductor in Hinton, WV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "fun, easy job. you get to see places you normally wouldnt from a one of a kind perspective. if you like to travel it is a lot of fun and the work is not hard at all.", "cons": "the hours are rough being on call 24/7. it is difficult on relationships because sometimes you have to leave in the middle of dinner or during a movie."}, {"review_title": "Freight Conductor", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Freight Conductor in Fort Wayne, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay is good when working, very enjoyable job to have and not the exact same every time out.

If you read through all the reviews for CSX on Glassdoor, you will notice a definate pattern. Those who work in an office type environment or regular hours (Mon-Fri, 8 hrs a day)  tend to have a favorable opinion of the CSX. Those who work  in the Transportation Department  -T&E (Trainmen and Engineers), as I do, almost always have a poor opinion of CSX. \r\n At any rate I've been with CSX for 10+  years. I have never in my life worked for a company where there is so much animosity between management  and the frontline labor force. It is definately a hostile, them against us environment. These flames are fanned on a regular basis by poorly qualified low and mid level managers.\r\n The hours are long and unpredictable. 12 hour days are not uncommon and you will most likely be on call 24 hrs per day. With the exception of yard jobs, you will seldom go to, or get off work at the same time. You may get called at 23:00 and be expected to work till 11:00 the next morning.  The next time you may be called to work 11:00 until 23:00.  It is a NEVER ENDING case of jet lag. Depending on the job, you will likely get 1 day off per week or 2 days off every other week. It is unlikely that your day or days off will include a Saturday or Sunday.  Again unless you are working a yard job, there is no such thing as a holiday.  Trainmen (Conductor) and Engineer jobs are seldom beneficial to ones health or relationships (spouse, family and friends). You may think that all that travel and rail riding sounds fun and exciting, but going back and forth between the same points over and over quickly becomes monotonous/tedious.  \r\nI could go on with detail after detail about the \"cons\" but I think you may be getting my point. Over all if you are considering a job with CSX, look for one with regular hours and days off in a department other than Transportation.
