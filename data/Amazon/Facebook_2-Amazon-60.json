On the retail side it\u2019s like running your own business. There\u2019s so much to do and you\u2019re never bored with the work. It\u2019s neat to see how everything you do impacts your business and improves it.\r\n\r\nCasual Work Environment\r\nIt's also quite nice that you can go to work in jeans and a t-shirt. Bringing your dog to work is great also, but really it's just a wait to keep you there longer.", "cons": "Before I go into the cons I\u2019m going to say that this is based upon my personal experience during my 3 positions on the retail side of the company.\r\n\r\nNo Work Life Balance\r\n60 hour work weeks are normal. Meetings at 5:00 happen and people regularly work past 7:00. It feels like I go to work, get home, work some more, go to sleep, and repeat. On the weekends I get a bit of a break, but I still am required to work as I have certain reports and other tasks that have not yet been automated to complete. Amazon work kills all hope I have of an outside life.\r\n\r\nAlways on call\r\nEven being on vacation doesn\u2019t matter as you\u2019ll receive high priority emails management wants answered right away.  Holidays are no exceptions. I was called once at 6:00 AM on a holiday because of a promotion running at a competitor I had to match. I finished all tasks associated with the promotion at about 8:00 PM. I didn\u2019t have a holiday as a result, but customers were able to get a good deal on the retail products I was in charge of.\r\n\r\nSingle People Preferred\r\nDo not expect to see your kids or significant other regularly. If you mention you have to leave early, like 5:00 (which is a normal 8 to 5 day) to pick up your kids or go to a dinner date, expect to be mocked by your boss after you\u2019re gone. I\u2019m regularly late now to almost all after work events because of work that is given and required to be completed after 5:00.\r\n\r\nToo Much Work\r\nThis is great as you\u2019re never bored, but it also means you\u2019ll constantly be working. Lunch normally doesn\u2019t happen as you\u2019re in a meeting during that time, completing something for later deadline, or rushing for a fire drill. It\u2019s basically survival of the fittest here. You will need to automate your tasks or risk drowning in a pile of endless work. There are a lot of improvements needed to be made at Amazon and management wants them done now.\r\n\r\nHigh Bars\r\nOnce you\u2019ve automated your work and reached your goals, you\u2019ll be asked to surpass that the next year. Eventually your goals will become impossible to achieve. I\u2019ve mentioned this to management and their answers are normally along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m not sure how you\u2019ll be able to improve, but you need to.\u201d\r\n\r\nSmall Raises \r\nI\u2019ve been lucky that I\u2019ve achieved high ratings on my reviews and so my raises have been just above inflation. Even so, they\u2019re laughable. Raises occur only on your base pay and your base pay is relatively a small portion of your compensation.\r\n\r\nGolden-handcuffs\r\nAmazon entices you with a bonus your first two years and stock every year afterwards. If you leave the company before the end of the year in which you received a bonus you\u2019ll have to pay it back. If you leave during one of the years in which your stock vest it\u2019s like you worked for nothing. My stock is almost equal to my base pay for example. This keeps you working for the company.\r\n\r\nLow Base Pay\r\nLiving off your base pay is also terrible as the cost of living here in Seattle is rising. You\u2019re income on paper will look like you make a decent amount of money, but only because of your stock/bonuses. If you choose not to cash out of it when it vests you\u2019ll be living by meager means as most of your pay will go to rent and other expenses. Having a low base pay also puts you in a different bracket for loans as they don\u2019t consider your grants and bonuses reliable income.\r\n\r\nFrugality\r\nOnly the bus pass is free. Parking is not and parking is expensive. Amazon will reimburse up $160 worth of parking, but at over $25.00 a day it doesn\u2019t go very far. If you can get monthly parking you\u2019ll pay less, but there\u2019s a long wait list. On the bright side most people leave after 2 years so you may get a spot if you stay long enough. There are also no employee perks that I\u2019m aware of, except free coffee and tea in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nPerformance Improvement Plans\r\nPIP is very real at Amazon. A certain number of people in your department every year will be put on it. Essentially the weakest link will be eliminated. If you don\u2019t perform better than someone else you\u2019ll be let go. Politics are very real and active as well. Consider it similar to Game of Thrones. Make sure someone owes you a favor and preferably that\u2019s someone at a higher level.\r\n\r\nPromotions\r\nLateral moves are common, promotions are not. Most people rotate after 1-1/2 years. Getting promoted requires laterally moving to a high job level. Once in that level you will need to perform the job better than coworkers doing the same job at the level you\u2019re trying to get promoted to. This accounts to doing a much harder job with more work at a lower wage than everyone else until you\u2019ve proven yourself. You\u2019re also competing with other coworkers at your level and job for the promotion. This works great for the company, but makes you feel like you\u2019re way underpaid for the job you\u2019re doing.\r\n\r\nTurnover\r\nI\u2019m not sure the exact numbers as Amazon is constantly hiring new people, but it seems high. I\u2019ve seen lots of people leave Amazon that I\u2019ve worked with. The average stay seems to be about 2 years. After that people leave for better opportunities. Consider this place a stepping stone to the next job. Also expect your workload to increase each time someone leaves until they fill that position. You may be moving on before that happens though as Amazon has a really high bar for hiring."}, {"review_title": "A nightmare called Amazon Web Services", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Operations Manager in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Let us start with Amazon first and then with AWS.

After applying for 4 years consistently I got my first call and then got called onsite right away and then an offer within 24 hours. I understood they needed a person on board very badly. Because it is Amazon, you will take the offer right away without thinking and plus the offer is so lucrative that you will just take it. Don\u2019t be fooled with the stock options they offer as a part of the hiring package. Ask for more base salary or joining bonus. Average tenure at amazon for an employee is 1.5 years and stock options mature in 3rd and 4th year and hence you don\u2019t see a single penny of it. Amazon pays you high but takes away your personal and family life. It is a place where everyone tries to prove they are right, even at the cost of other colleagues.

The office politics gets to you if you believe that hard work is the only means to progress in your career. Not many people know that amazon has this unique culture of laying off 10% of the work force every year irrespective of what you put in. So your relationship with your manager and other managers also will matter when it comes to review. Also, at amazon, anyone can write a review about you at any time, which will count towards your final performance review. So you have to watch your back constantly and have to be people smart and also work smart. This is not easy because even if you put in 120% you may not be in the best books with others because you did company\u2019s good and in doing so, you stepped over someone in some way, who will write a review about you and to which you have no visibility to. So what you will see in your review will always be a surprise. If a decision is made to let you go per the 10% lay off rule, then they will give you 100 excuses and reasons of not performing.

Someone somewhere is constantly counting the strikes against you and you will see that in your review or some other way when you finally walk off from AWS. The whole company runs on excel sheets with no ERP system that is strong enough to give visibility to people. So there is constant guessing and errors in what you communicate. Even if this is happening, you should be able to prove that you are smart and good at all times. There is a culture of writing a white paper. Any time something goes wrong you write a 1 pager and publish to the group. The management believes in churning papers, which no one really reads in future but you need to write them for proving your point or to cover of the mess that happened for no fault of yours but may be held against you. These papers take your office time and then you have meetings that never end and the work will start after 5.00pm. They actually have hired someone to help you write these papers. Amazon does not believe in ppt but believes in word documents. They are so frugal that they do not have a color printer on every floor. You may have to go 10 floors up or down to get that 1 colored copy. The seating space is so cramped up and they call it high density seating. You can actually touch 3-4 people if you stretch ur hand on both sides. There is a wait list for 2 years for parking in the building. So you eventually take a bus every day. All I would say is it is a big mess in AWS supply chain group. Which company hires and fires people in a period of 1 year, just because someone wrote something against you. The trust and healthy work culture does not exist. You will lose your health and hair in return of wealth that you cannot enjoy.

Amazon is a place where you will have very challenging work for a very good cause, customer experience.  I have a career of working in the customer service business and I've learned more and achieved more in my time with Amazon than with any other organization.  \r\n\r\nPeople are passionate about the work which does result in sometimes heated conversations, but those conversations are all grounded on one thing, \"What is the best experience for customers?\"  It is refreshing to go into discussions with this same grounding as it enables you to walk out of the room and know the debate was not personal towards an individual, but focused on doing the right thing for our customers.\r\n\r\nI also appreciate the focus on excellence in written communication.  I have learned even more about the power of the written word than I knew coming into the company.  By applying your focus to writing a document, you enable a clarity of thought that isn't seen through power point.  Writing in a narrative format forces you to think critically about your proposal or update and forces you to think about the questions that others will have on your document.  While it may be a painful adjustment in the beginning, you will quickly realize the value and will never want to go back!\r\n\r\nThe last big Pro to working at Amazon is that you never know what's going to happen next.  In my time with the company I've seen us grow from a retailer to disruptor in the reading industry to disruptor in the tablet industry to a disruptor in the creation of digital content to who knows what is next to disrupt.  It is very exciting to work for a company that is constantly evolving and becoming a bigger part of the digital ecosystem while also challenging conventional thoughts about any industry.", "cons": "No company is perfect at all things and there are certainly things Amazon can do better.  First is correcting the perception that there is no work/life balance.  i have been in roles in Amazon where there was very little balance and I've been in roles where there is a good balance.  What I've come to learn, is it is generally on me to draw those lines and stick to them.  The company does need to do more to help employees achieve a proper balance rather relying on the the good intentions of the employee or their manager.\r\n\r\nIf you don't live/work in Seattle, get ready to adjust your life to the Seattle timezone.  At Amazon, the world revolves around Seattle and, in my opinion, is the chief reason why work/life balance is a struggle for those in the field.  There are not enough people in Seattle that think about other timezones when setting up meetings and such.  A 10am \"check-in\" on a Saturday morning Seattle time during the holidays is a far cry from a 7pm \"check-in\" on Saturday evening when you work on the other side of the globe (and it's summer).  While you can certainly speak up about it, you may be the minority that is impacted that way and without senior leaders thinking about this, you will generally suck it up and do it to avoid being a \"complainer\".  A peer once chastised me (to another peer) when I was working internationally on when I would stop bringing up the international locations in our discussions to which that peer responded, \"probably when we start thinking about the international locations on our own.\"\r\n\r\nIf you have a role that requires extensive international travel, realize that all of those trips (no matter how long) will be in coach.  I've flown in coach for over 24 hours (in the air, not counting time in airports) for several required work trips a year.  While you may get to travel to some really great places, there is a cost to your health.  This is done to be \"frugal\", but is one of the areas where I believe we are just cheap and senior leaders are scared to challenge it after seeing how leaders in the past were treated after challenging the policy (you can read about it in \"The Everything Store\").  I am in no way advocating for first class trips across the board, but if the company is requiring you to travel where you will spend more than 8-10 hours in the air, the least they can do is spend money to ensure you are comfortable and will arrive ready to get to work.  Rather, most employees leave on these longer trips a day earlier than they otherwise would so there is time to recover once you arrive.  When I've brought this up to VPs, the common response is referring to the example discussed in \"The Everything Store\" and that it is \"career suicide\" to challenge this policy at an executive level.  Once you travel frequently, you can use the miles you've accumulated for business travel to get upgrades but you are subject to the airlines upgrade policies which are very restrictive for international flights and sometimes impossible (coach tickets are bought at the cheapest fair possible) unless you pay out of pocket to upgrade the coach ticket to a fare that is eligible for complimentary upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe compensation philosophy is focused on base pay and restricted stock units.  While this is a great retention tool and drives ownership in employees to help the stock price improve, it is painful for employees to have such shifts in their pay year to year that is largely driven by sways in the stock market.  When it's good it's GREAT, but when the market corrects itself it makes for a painful compensation discussion with your employees in the following years.  There is little done to really educate people on the philosophy outside of standard training at annual review time that is not very effective at helping people understand the value."}, {"review_title": "violator of labor laws.

Amazon has a internal feedback tool through which people can post reviews anonymously about any employee. The review is SBI (Situation, Behavior and Impact) based and is totally managed by your Manager. If you are not in good terms with your Manager or you do not have chemistry with your Manager then he/she can totally screw up your career at Amazon. Even though Amazon says it is data driven performance measurement of employee but still there are lot of ways your Manager can play around with it and highlight anything bad someone has mentioned about you. As the tool asks you both employee strength and weakness. I would suggest anyone new joining the company beware of this..\r\n\r\nBe prepared to loose your work life balance.

(because you have to learn a lot of legacy code and systems first) Just imagine in a 300 dev org, only 3 people can be promoted per quarter, so even if you are in the top 10% right in your first day, you have to wait years till it will be your turn.\r\n\r\nAlso nothing matters that happened before the hire date you have to prove yourself there (just to slow down any promotion).
