That greater project was a mess.\r\n\r\nManagers/team situation: There is no \"judicial system\" as one of my old managers put it -- on my most recent team I had worked on a team comprised of Localization Project Managers, despite my role as a developer. My code reviews would have to go out to the development team, though I was not allowed to sit with them after several serious discussions with my manager on this. Depending on your proximity to your manager's manager, there may be nothing to do to prevent these sorts of scenarios, so be very careful when choosing a team when you are allowed to do so.\r\n\r\nMy initial team consisted of 5 developers initially, going down to 2 after a split a few months later. The other developer and I received little interaction from our Software Development Manager who was often somewhere else trying to move up himself, and we worked primarily with some Technical Program Managers. The biggest issue in this situation was that the nature of our work was not the type of project needed to get promoted to SDE-II, though our half-of-the-time present manager would often persuade us in believing otherwise that this was not the case."}, {"review_title": "hourly picker", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Warehouse Associate in Middletown, DE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "very straight forward job, benefits immediately, fast pace, very little contact with leadership, four day work week, overtime possible, shift deferential", "cons": "very little leadership, did not meet manager till fourth day have not seen her since, a lot of walking, on your feet ten hours, associate questioned me why i did not make the quota after a break, i asked why she i thought i did not make it.  did not a reason or solution, learned very quickly that management was reactive not proactive.  the pick route will determine if you make quota or not."}, {"review_title": "Risk Analyst", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Risk Analyst in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great exposure to different organizations within the company.

The final 9 months was pure hell. I was placed in another role reporting to a different manager. I received absolutely no support from this manager, no job training, the expectation was that from day 1 in the new role I was an expert. My role changed 3 times in the last 3 months and each time there was no training. The senior management favor their closest groups and it isn't uncommon for small group to be promoted over and over again leaving others behind. There was a high turnover in my building and it was obvious why. The expectation that you will work 16 hour days for 4 and 5 days a week just becomes too much. During peak you'll become a stranger to your family and your dog will think you're an intruder when you get home! Being yelled at and cussed at in front of your peers and subordinates is part of the daily norm. Expect no support from HR, there policy is to hand everything back to you with the expectation that you will do their job for them. You will feel completely unmotivated and just worn down.The sad part is that Jeff Bezos really believes that the managers are happy little worker bees. Amazon sells everything including itself to prospective management hires, and it does an excellent job.

If you went out on leave (except maternity leave), stock will be put on hold. So it will take longer to earn those stock. \nLong hours. Start to work at 5 or 6 am and might not done until 6 or 7 pm (all salaries positions, including HR and any support staff). If you are salaried employee, prepare to work to death. Maybe even on day off. Most salaries employees work at least one day on the weekend. As HR, I have seen senior manager discuss with each other how some people doesn\u2019t work long hour and doesn\u2019t not want to check email on their day off. Those are the one will never be promoted, because they are not available all the times. This is not happened only during peak. I have tried to change this mind set from some senior manager. Unfortunately, hr doesn\u2019t have much voice when decide who to promote. Not all senior manager are the same.

You will never have time for family. On top of that, pregnant women definitely won\u2019t get a chance at promotion. Although amazon rolled out nee maternity leave, but taking full advance of the leave comes with consequences. I have seen a manager, who was 37 weeks pregnant, worked 14 hours a day. Go home and still answer email at 2 am. It\u2019s not requirement to answer email at 2 am, but if she didn\u2019t, she got a dirty look why it was not done. When she came back from maternity leave, she applied for the ramp back program which provided her with less work schedule (50 %of full-time schedule ). She was in that schedule for a week. She was a burden at the facility. The ramp back schedule just doesn\u2019t work for salaried employee, who is on call 24/7. Again it was not a requirement that written down, but it was an unspoken expectation (especially if you want to be promoted). That was the amazon culture that I got used to. Being hourly employees were little better.

If you went out on leave (except maternity leave), stock will be put on hold. So it will take longer to earn those stock. \nLong hours. Start to work at 5 or 6 am and might not done until 6 or 7 pm (all salaries positions, including HR and any support staff). If you are salaried employee, prepare to work to death. Maybe even on day off. Most salaries employees work at least one day on the weekend. As HR, I have seen senior manager discuss with each other how some people doesn\u2019t work long hour and doesn\u2019t not want to check email on their day off. Those are the one will never be promoted, because they are not available all the times. This is not happened only during peak. I have tried to change this mind set from some senior manager. Unfortunately, hr doesn\u2019t have much voice when decide who to promote. Not all senior manager are the same. However, 4 years with amazon, I only met 1 senior manager that truly care for his employees work life balance. \nAlso if you have small children, this will not be the job for you. You will never have time for family. On top of that, pregnant women definitely won\u2019t get a chance at promotion. Although amazon rolled out nee maternity leave, but taking full advance of the leave comes with consequences. I have seen a manager, who was 37 weeks pregnant, worked 14 hours a day. Go home and still answer email at 2 am. It\u2019s not requirement to answer email at 2 am, but if she didn\u2019t, she got a dirty look why it was not done. When she came back from maternity leave, she applied for the ramp back program which provided her with less work schedule (50 %of full-time schedule ). She was in that schedule for a week. She was a burden at the facility. The ramp back schedule just doesn\u2019t work for salaried employee, who is on call 24/7. Again it was not a requirement that written down, but it was an unspoken expectation (especially if you want to be promoted). That was the amazon culture that I got used to.

Next the number of not-so-great internal customers and crummy co-workers overbalance that of the good ones.  A good size group of people at Amazon are overloaded, working insane hours to just keep ones' head above water. Next there is a much larger group that floats along, doing passable work and maintainig relationships to stay in place. Then there is a small number of  \"chosen\" few, those who benefit from their managers favor with decent hours expected for work and favoritism for advancement.  So those doing the majority of work are in the minority. \r\n\r\nAnother big issue comes up when reviews come around and a single digit percent of the population is to be managed out. This can have to do with performance, but it can also be that your manager just likes someone else better. To bad, but Amazon has to \"keep raising the bar.\" The average employee may get a small increase and a little bit of stock. Those with favor from the boss get a nice batch of RSUs and cash, too, as a bonus (Dont let them tell you theres no cash bonus - its there just for a few). Just remember that if you are getting an offer from Amazon know that they will try to shill you coming in the door and screw you while you are there, So dont take the first offer. Make sure to get as much stock and base as you can because you will not see much of an increase over time, nor much additional stock grants even if you do a great job.\r\n\r\nThen there are the managers and mid-level leadership.  When I joined Amazon there was a good size population of good, even great, managers.  Those who wanted to help those around them succeed. Over time these people have left, only to be replaced by the average Amazon manager. This person does not care about you. He cares about his bonus (see above). He wants his manager to be happy and show the love. You are just a way for him to benefit. This deportment of a manager is not uncommon; its anywhere. Its just that the bad actors have an added fuel of the Amazonian attitude.  \r\n\r\nThe Amazonian attitude is a cocky, I'm-so-much-more-smarter-than-you, obnoxious, the world owes me attitude. Kind of like a smart mouthy kid who takes the ball home when he doesnt get his way.  A majority of the managers at place really have this aura, as do many many others. The place reeks of this cocky snarkyness. And you'll be that way, too, if you work there.  It creeps in and takes over.  You might not know its there until your spouse tells you so.

There are lots of very smart, motivated, professional people at this company.  Working with them can help you raise your game.

Thats provided the stock is low enough to see the effort pay off.\r\n\r\nOh, you can bring your dog to work.\r\n\r\nI have no regrests for having worked at Amazon. I knew what I was signing up for when I joined.", "cons": "Downsides are many.  Start with that you are working in dog-years.  You will work harder then you ever have before. Next the number of not-so-great internal customers and crummy co-workers overbalance that of the good ones.  A good size group of people at Amazon are overloaded, working insane hours to just keep ones' head above water. Next there is a much larger group that floats along, doing passable work and maintainig relationships to stay in place. Then there is a small number of  \"chosen\" few, those who benefit from their managers favor with decent hours expected for work and favoritism for advancement.  So those doing the majority of work are in the minority. \r\n\r\nAnother big issue comes up when reviews come around and a single digit percent of the population is to be managed out. This can have to do with performance, but it can also be that your manager just likes someone else better. To bad, but Amazon has to \"keep raising the bar.\" The average employee may get a small increase and a little bit of stock. Those with favor from the boss get a nice batch of RSUs and cash, too, as a bonus (Dont let them tell you theres no cash bonus - its there just for a few). Just remember that if you are getting an offer from Amazon know that they will try to shill you coming in the door and screw you while you are there, So dont take the first offer. Make sure to get as much stock and base as you can because you will not see much of an increase over time, nor much additional stock grants even if you do a great job.\r\n\r\nThen there are the managers and mid-level leadership.  When I joined Amazon there was a good size population of good, even great, managers.  Those who wanted to help those around them succeed. Over time these people have left, only to be replaced by the average Amazon manager. This person does not care about you. He cares about his bonus (see above). He wants his manager to be happy and show the love. You are just a way for him to benefit. This deportment of a manager is not uncommon; its anywhere. Its just that the bad actors have an added fuel of the Amazonian attitude.  \r\n\r\nThe Amazonian attitude is a cocky, I'm-so-much-more-smarter-than-you, obnoxious, the world owes me attitude. Kind of like a smart mouthy kid who takes the ball home when he doesnt get his way.  A majority of the managers at place really have this aura, as do many many others. The place reeks of this cocky snarkyness. And you'll be that way, too, if you work there.  It creeps in and takes over.  You might not know its there until your spouse tells you so.  Then again you are smarter then your spouse! Ha!  They couldnt get a job at Amazon!!  You might not know you have the attitude until after you leave the company.

Great pay - I've only seen 2 companies (Google & FB) in Seattle offer more than my current total compensation, and while some in the Bay Area do, it's not more after adjusting for cost of living.\r\n2. Part of an exciting company\r\n3. Fast-paced\r\n4. Hands-on experience with massively scaled software.\r\n5. Very laid back about working from home (although this varies from team to team)\r\n6. Objective, merit-based analysis for promotions. Not much office politics or nepotism in my org (caveat: I've heard very different things from other orgs)\r\n7. Good hardware. This was not the case at all before 2015 or 2016. Now almost every dev. has a top-of-the-line MacBook Pro, at least 1 EC2 instance, and an ultrawide monitor (or 2 regular monitors).", "cons": "1. If you are a new grad hire, they may place you on a team that has nothing to do with your interests or what org you were told you would work for when you accepted the offer. Even if you have 0 experience in that area. I've heard this from at least 10 people. It seems to be common.\r\n2. Extremely high operational load, especially in Retail.\r\n3. \"Fail fast\" approach and unrealistic deadlines have lead to shortcuts being taken, widespread tech debt, and a very serious retention problem. Even the engineers that stay at Amazon switch teams every 2-3 years.\r\n4. Hardly anything is documented  (including widely-used services and tooling). Building almost anything requires constantly engaging other teams, who are often unresponsive or unhelpful. Tribal knowledge is lost when people leave the team (in my first year, 80% of the 20 engineers on my team left - and this is not uncommon). Imagine that you have to write an app using a web framework (AngularJS, as an example) that you aren't familiar with and you must call 5 services with undocumented APIs. You aren't allowed to use any documentation at all, or refer to any books on AngularJS. You do have an IDE, and can contact the creators of the services you need to use. This is exactly what it is like developing at Amazon.  It takes the fun out of it entirely, and makes building anything much harder than it should be (compared to using off-the-shelf tools/libraries and documented APIs). Amazon has been lauded for adopting a Service-oriented architecture; what isn't mentioned is that none of the services are documented, even though they have (usually multiple) clients.\r\n5. Culture is very cult-like.\r\n6. The company highly values fresh-out-of-college hires. They believe that potential is everything. In software engineering, though, experience can be incredibly important, too. I suspect they prefer college hires because it is much easier to get them to overwork, and they are less likely to have families. College teaches data structures & algorithms, but not software best practices. Code quality is often very poor.\r\n7. The work is challenging only due to the complexity of figuring out what is undocumented, interfacing with other teams, etc., not the actual coding part.\r\n8. Very difficult to change any entrenched practice, even if it can be demonstrated to be ineffective and better alternatives are available.\r\n9. Management is typically very short-sighted. Schedules are determined by when higher-level mgmt wants a project to be completed, and all projects must be completed by the end of the current calendar year. Usually there is little to no input from the actual engineers. All that matters is if the code meets the goal or not, with little if any consideration on whether it is a ticking time-bomb that will be unreliable and require frequent maintenance. Most code at Amazon is not robust, and requires 24/7 oncall coverage for frequent breakages."}, {"review_title": "The world's most customer centric organisation", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Nov 2017", "job_title": "Senior Associate in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazon is one of the world's best organization to be part of where we start from backwards from our customer and are on the journey of constant innovation on behalf of our customers.

So you're going to have to figure out how to accomplish the bare minimum frequently to avoid being a total failure, while looking successful, while trying to hire more people for your team :) If you have no interest in building a great career, and want to just relax in your job, it's unlikely you'll be successful here.\r\n\r\nI'd also say that due to the quick growth, management can be inconsistent. I've seen failures where people didn't take enough control over their careers, and sat working for a poor manager for too long. Amazon doesn't have a ton of parachutes for people who don't actively manage their careers. \"I wonder why I haven't been promoted in the last 4 years\" is viewed as a personal failure at Amazon, not necessarily a management failure. So again, people are expected to self-drive. Find exciting roles, find good managers, you can't sit and wait at Amazon for opportunities to come to you, because things are too chaotic for that to happen :)\r\n\r\nFinally, frugality can end up in \"frupidity\" land at times. Amazon will build beautiful new buildings (like the new Doppler building downtown), but then some teams will ask for donations to buy beers for a team event. It's baffling how some teams take frugality to such a stupid level. Overall it's a great thing to be frugal, it builds efficiency into the company as a whole, but it can be painful when some leaders end up taking it too far."}], [{"review_title": "Not for the faint of hearted but a very unique special to work in", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Senior Software Development Engineer in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazon has a very unique culture which can sometimes be intimidated for people who do not fit the corporate principles but for others it may be a perfect fit.

Most were designed poorly by amateurs and then scaled aggressively to keep up with the cloud computing hype.  As a result, there's some catastrophic operational nightmare occurring at any given time of day within AWS, and some poor souls are scrambling to apply more bubble gum and baling wire. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company, AWS specifically, operates on the lone, hollow vision of \"make the customer happy\".  With no vision comes constant re-prioritizing of work, bike shedding, and conflict, which only makes getting anything significant done in an under-resourced, massive, and operationally-intensive environment that much more impossible.  Vision and long term strategy aren't valued, which makes sense given that a lot of the leadership seems to be context switching between outages, people management, and 3-6 month out feature launches.  Odds are that your work will be largely limited to putting out interesting fires or making something terrible last a bit longer.  That and perpetuating the thin public veneer of elegant automation at scale, which in actuality are crude scripts (see any number of high visibility outages) at best and clumsy human driven deployments, changes, and operational responses at worst. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTalent, overall, is not great because of the self-perpetuating cycle of under-investment in hiring and its second order consequences: poorly designed and maintained systems that drove high operational burden and ultimately attrition.  Intelligent and capable folks have mostly gotten the read that Amazon is a miserable place to be, which only makes this feedback loop worse.  To keep the lights on through the last few years of cloud computing hype, AWS has hired a horde of low-bar, Enterprise-type characters that seem endemic to corporations well past their high point.  A lot of AWS is well past day 2.

Moving between teams seems to be the only way to outmaneuver some of the miserable circumstances within the company and is available to those not under-performing.  Research as much as possible before signing your offer.  Ask your hiring manager about vision/priorities, attrition, and expectations out of different roles within the team.  Ask about what their biggest fears and goals are, and determine if they\u2019re serious and/or capable of addressing either.

We do not send rockets to the moon, we just send packages.\r\n- Chances for promotion. I started as a temporary associate part-time with a one month contract. I was not the only one promoted from the inside.\r\n- If you got computer skills (basic excel) and if you got a vision and act as a leader despite your level or contract, you will get noticed and given more responsabilities and chances.\r\n- If you are a born leader you will built for yourself a nice shift and you will find the means and power to make the associates enjoy their work and time on shift.\r\n- It is up to you to find your own path, and there is always a path if you got a vision and the ambition and balls to back it up.\r\n- You can decide a lot of things for your shift and associates.\r\n- Background does not matter as long as you prove yourself on the job.\r\n- Making a difference in associates lives really makes you feel good as long as you are in it for the people and not the money.\r\n- You learn a lot and get learnt a lot if you know what you want to learn and ask for it. \r\n- During peak (November - December) L1 associates can receive a 2 months contract as Temporary Operations Supervisors. This means they get paid better, benefit from the experience and stand a better chance for a future step-up promotion. If nothing else they can enjoy the money and the experience (looks good on CV).\r\n- You get to decide along with your Shift Manager who deserves a direct amazon working contract.\r\n- Don't hold it against me but having most of the associates hired through Job Agencies makes life easier as some associates really have no desire to work no matter how hard you try to motivate them. This means that it is easy to fire people that bring down others. I know, it sounds cruel but on the long term goals it's perfect. This means you can keep all the good, motivated, eager to learn and friendly associates and make a true team and build up team spirit. Associates are very sensible because they do a hard job (depending on shift) and nobody wants to work more than someone else for the same money. This way they say that you do your best to have everybody sharing the same work load/volume. \r\n- Stress only occurs if you are incapable of structuring your shift and your tasks, if you are used to always receive commands then you should not be in command and leading people. You figure out the best approach.\r\n- If you are lucky and good at being a leader, you can have a blast at work and have fun without concerning about metrics and targets since they will be met if you trained your work force correctly.\r\n- Once the core tasks are finished you have a lot of time to train your associates and engage with them and develop talent and find talented individuals. Its up to you.\r\n- Most of your associates (as it is in my shift) know each other outside of work, as most of them either study together or came together to Germany. If you treat them well, they will bring their friends and that creates an even more team culture as people will help each other without you ordering them to do so.\r\n- A good place to improve your leadership skills and to learn how to communicate to people.\r\n- In Germany associates work 7 hours with 30 minutes break. 5 days a week. As Supervisor if your shift is not understaffed, you work 5 days a week, in a good team you can decide your own free day and each one of us gets a Saturday off every two weeks.\r\n- Work life balance is good. On my shift we did the whole Peak with only me and a L4 and 70 L1. One of the best Peaks in the network. None of us worked 6 days a week. \r\n- All in all, a good place to work. The salary is good based on your actual work volume and number of hours. Prime and Peak periods are easy to deal with if you are confident in you and your team.

That means that some associates never get a chance due to no availability and you lose them to other jobs, but it is what it is, you train them, you form them and sometimes you lose them but I am always happy that with what they learnt they can find better jobs.\r\n- Sadly some associates are too shy or the language barrier is a big problem and they leave the station feeling like they never had a chance for more. \r\n- The gap in stocks between L3 and L4.\r\n- Like any work place, not every leader will be a good people leader. As a L3 yourself you can circumvent that and do your job with pride nonetheless but if you are an associate and you have the bad luck of being in a shift that does not have good leaders (for various reasons) then it can be hard as you can not really do much about it. In our station we are lucky that management cares about associate feedback and we always try to improve the safety and needs of associates but I know that not every station is as good as ours. But then again, all workplaces suffer from the same issue when you are part of a collective. Things improve in time if people care.\r\n- Sometimes it feels like you are kept in the dark and that certain things do not get passed to you and that can affect your decission making as you can go against management vision without even knowing it, but there are plenty of opportunities to speak up in meetings or ask questions in 1 on 1 type meetings with management.\r\n- Sometimes it can appear that it is hard to speak L3 to L3 as everybody wants to get promoted and competion starts; but then again, if you got the people skills you can bridge the gap and ensure that your advices do not fall on deaf ears.\r\n- Would love to be able to convert more temporary associates to direct amazon contracts but there is a fixed percentage. The good thing is that it goes up every year and you can reward your crew.\r\n- Lack of annual reviews where your salary increases based on your performance. All Supervisors have the same salary and the increase is a flat percentage to all of them. This only sucks if you are stuck in the same position for a lot of time. But then again, each good L3 sooner rather than later, gets the chance to promote.\r\n- Sometimes it can seem that you get more tasks and responsabilities than your peers, but have faith, you learn, adapt and overcome and rewards will follow.\r\n- Some L3s stress over small things, escalte them and start a blame game between shifts with chains of e-mails but those kind of fires most of the time get stopped by a L4/L5."}, {"review_title": "Reach extends beyond grasp.

An American vs Australian working culture can be quite different at times. Lately, the performance metrics were challenge to many and in my opinion are not the real representation of quality of work that an individual can produce in given period. At some point the work environment had all attributes of a call centre. Initially, the value of work/metric was based on quality and customer satisfaction. However, as the number of employees started to increase it become quantitative/number game. As a result, this had negatively impacted competition between the team members and reduce the time to learn and develop. Think about the customer obsession as one of the core company values and then ruin it with increasing resolve numbers only. Do you sacrifice quality over quantity? This statement addresses the Cloud Support unit or better to say foot soldiers, while I believe that other teams/sections have more freedom in this space. Another very important aspect to think of is work life balance. Everyone is preaching about work life balance and then you have Jeff Bezos revolutionary saying that it doesn't exist in some article. Of course, the senior management jumped on the bandwagon and indirectly imposing it on the work culture etc...Really?

People are incredibly smart, motivated, and expect you to come in and be autonomous in identifying problems, proposing solutions, and driving to completion. There's no hand-holding, and more often than not it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission, as things move incredibly fast. Action and progress is preferred over perfection. The interview process can be quite daunting, but it's absolutely worth it to weed through people who are good talkers, but not good doers. I've worked in places where confidence is interpretted to mean competence, and I'm so glad to see Amazon's \"bar raiser\" system weeding out that kind of nonsense! This company truly cares about its customers whether they're internal or external. I also LOVE that \"build trust\" is an Amazon Leadership Principle. The company puts an emphasis on collaborate development rather than rewarding bullies who talk and coerce their way into making decisions. In my short time at the company, I can already tell  that this is the kind of place I can see myself remaining a part of for the long term! This is particularly true given the company's support of employees moving roles and teams, even if their professional experience doesn't fully align to a role.

If you want to come in for the sake of putting Amazon on your resume without expecting to work hard or remain for > 2 years, then you're probably better off going elsewhere. I like that Amazon has changed its vesting schedule in order to drive away people who want to show up for a year, cash a paycheck, and then leave. They're investing in people who want to grow with the company, and it shows in their comp (heavy RSUs vs. base salary).  It's also true that many teams work incredibly hard, though your direct team will strongly influence your work/life balance.

I used to get really frustrated about the focus on frugality and the not-invented-here and build-it-over-buy-it mentality there.  However, seeing how the rest of the work does IT, I'm good with the frugal approach and building it and doing work.  Most people out there do IT via spending money on products to expand the domain of the IT manager, without any focus on the business, and without any metrics for success -- Amazon is the opposite fo that.  Everything needs a cost justification and its difficult to build empires without any competency.\r\n\r\nThe topgrading environment is actually good in some ways because it does eliminate a lot of the people that you have to put up with at other jobs who are totally useless.  The bar raising interviews and stack ranking does actually mean that you might be working with a bunch of other decently talented people rather than trying to drag a department along single handed.\r\n\r\nI usually get bored at a company after 2-3 years, but I stuck with Amazon for nearly 5 years before getting bored with it because it was growing so fast (grew from managing 400 servers to 30,000 servers in 5 years).

If you simply argue that a technology will be able to be leveraged in the future and is forwards-looking it will go nowhere with upper management (although Bezos gets to make bets like that, but the engineer on the ground doesn't get to make that kind of call).  Also, the focus on frugality leads to lots of turnover with the employees as they get treated like replaceable cogs.\r\n\r\nThe topgrading environment is also a little abusive.  It doesn't allow for someone who is simply doing a necessary job and doing it well to stay in that job, a lot of good people have been chewed up and spit out by Amazon, which increases churn.

The philosophy seems to be to mindless pressure the employees to improve \"productivity\".    Amazon seems to do this way beyond the optimal point.  This may be a trait of Jeff's that filters through the organization and manifests in a distorted form.  The death march feeling is always there and morale is poor.  24X7 pagers are common but you may not be told in the interview process.  \r\nIntellectual pretensions in technology: Possibly due to a lot of bright but immature young hires there is a bit of a poseur culture regarding what is appreciated.

HD seating means developers no longer get their own cubicles, we have to sit in large bullpens that contain a dozen or more people.  This is just terrible for both productivity and culture (everybody is too noisy, so productivity takes a major hit, but you also try to be considerate of your neighbors, so socializing takes a hit).  They say this problem will go away when the new buildings start coming online later in 2014, but they really need to just rent more space now.  At the rate Amazon is growing, those new buildings will fill up with HD seating just as soon as they're built.  \r\n\r\nOn a similar note about Amazon's growth:  it feels like we're in a phase of runaway personnel growth.  This means we can't hire front-line managers fast enough to keep up with the development team expansion, and the development teams are getting to large for their managers to handle.  Also there are a lot of fairly new managers who really don't know what they are doing.  This is resulting in lots of developers not getting the help they need to further their careers.  \r\n\r\nSoftware testing is one of those areas that comes into political favor, and goes out again in a couple of years.  In some departments, this means the QA teams get absorbed into the development teams (and then those people get assigned developer work and pagers).  In other departments, this means that the QA team just doesn't get headcount expansion to cover new teams and team expansion.  But the QA team is still expected to do some kind of coverage of these expanded and new teams.  This means nobody is happy with the QA teams.  Developers are frustrated because QA isn't keeping up, and is stalling releases.  Development managers are put upon to provide more headcount for QA, or otherwise close the gap.  QA is unhappy from being overworked and/or not getting the services covered.

Once you figure everything out it's relatively easy, but occasionally challenging depending on the day and what process your in. Alot of  the people you see complaining are the ones who couldn't cut it. At first it's not easy but you eventually perfect your process. Honestly I make 200 -300% Rate some days by accident. My Record is 487%. But I'm not typical. Also I had a seasoned veteran take me under his wing, and now another veteran from ICQA is doing the same with the hopes I'll transfer. See the rate everyone is complaining about is actually revised every 3 months. They take the last 3 months work-flow and avarage it. Somewhere in the middle is where they set the rate. Except peak, because everything goes into overdrive. I actually spend much if my shift remembering to slow down because I realized I was raising the rates for every one else. Some people have problems making rate, this job isn't for everyone. But most people actually have trouble with the quality aspect. You are only able to make about 1 or 2 mistakes a week or you get written up. 30 day, 60 day, 90, day. 4th written is termination. I got 3 in my first 5 weeks. I was basically fired. But the veteran helped me out and I survived the 90 day \"Gauntlet\" (you can't make more than 1 mistake a week or your done). It's very rare someone survived the 90 days. In recent memory I'm the only one to do so in a few years, most people tell you to just quit and apply again in 90 days. If you get fired for 4th written your not elegable for re-hire (so I hear). I mastered my process and  actually am capable of such a high rate that I've gotten 5 errors and no written because I actually could have afforded 1 more before a written because it's actually a defect per thousand scans. But I don't chance it. Really it's about quality. Also I don't want to raise the rate for everyone else, doesn't make for good relations with co-workers. But it wasn't easy to get where I'm at, and I put alot of effort and focus to become one of the best in my FC. It feels good when they have you come to the desk and show you your actually rated #1 stower in Reno. But, try not to be the best, you might get stuck in that process. There are many different processes in each Department. Also make sure to ask them regularly to get cross trained in a different Department. After Xmas and Aug-oct it gets slow and if your cross trained you can pick up extra time in another Department.", "cons": "Training is a joke. A sad rediculous joke. Inadequate is being polite. Basically it's a piece of paper with what I assume is the most basic requirements by law. PPE, (your safety equipment) and the \"no duh Sherlock's\" of what you shouldn't do to avoid injury or death. And then a binder with some basic information, mostly how to operate the scanners or workstation. Problem is, they recruit trainers every year so basically no one has much experience training. A few do, but mostly the person training you will give you the impression that they just started training people...because they did. And worst part is...Amazon has this rediculous philosophy that you don't necessarily need to actually know how to the job your training people to do, in order to train people to do that job. So a really good possibility that the person training you, has never done that job, and can't even answer the most basic questions about that process unless it on the papers in the binder. Which good chance it's not. But on the bright side, you don't think to ask those questions until way later, because you generally understand so little about your job that you don't even know enough to ask the obvious questions because they aren't obvious due to the sheer lack of understanding the job your doing. Like for instance, if you scan a box and then it doesn't fit in the shelf, then what? Well you could reset the scanner and log back in, and waste 5 minutes, or you could run around until you find a spot and hope you didn't confuse that item with another item in your cage, I mean it's a bunch of brown boxes sometimes.,.right? Or...you can just move the item back to your cage (if you know how) and pick up another item that will fit. Basics of stow process. Not one word of such things durring training. Oh, and don't ask your manager, 9 out of 10 times they don't know either. They're not that kind of manager. Most managers couldn't do your job to save their lives, much less to the standard they require. My boss is cool, she openly admits this, and is respected for it. Ask your PA, which is like your supervisor. They've usually done your job at some point. But mostly ask your problem solver or a veteran. Oh, and READ YOUR SCANNER!! Seems simple enough but hardly anybody does. And I don't mean look at it, READ it. Honestly this advice is the best I can give you, because at the end of the day, it's not a very hard job. It's just hard forming  new habits. But once you do, its relatively easy. It just sucks how unprepared you are when they send you out there. As simple as things are sometimes, simple things are only obvious to those who do it everyday. By the way, it's standard policy to hire 2 to 3 times more people that needed because 50% are expected to \"wash out\" in the first few weeks. They like to say it's because of the high standards, but really it's because the training is  inadequate and they don't move people to other processes that they might be better suited for. Granted you need to eventually learn several processes but if they put you in one process and immediately you have problems meeting standards, you are barred from moving to another task. Some people might fare better if they start with something else and work up to a more difficult process. But I guess that's what they mean by hire and develop the best. That is to say, hire the first 30 people who show up and let the one of them who's really good figure it out on their own. That's how you know their the best. Because they figured out how to do the job, despite you. Seriously, their idea of retraining some one before they fire them is to walk up to them and ask \" so what do you think the problem is?\" Then they ask what you intend to do to fix it. Then they go over something that has nothing to do with the problem your having, like barcode progression. Then they scurry off thinking they accomplished something. I mean come on...I am only allowed to have 2 defects per 3000 units, but the learning department can have a 80% failure rate? I started with 27 other people. After 2 months, there were 5, after 3 months, 3. By 6 months just 2, and now at one year, just me. But then again, this job isn't for everybody. Yet they hire anybody just about anybody. It seems instead of spending a few hours training 30 people who won't survive, they should focus more hours on fewer, more promising prospects"}, {"review_title": "NOT FOR ADHD", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Nov 2017", "job_title": "Cycle Counter in Edgerton, KS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay, and the benefits are amazing.

They see the people who are really grinding, so they'll always pick on you to work hard or to do extra work or warehouse duties. If you always give it 150%, they'll expect you to always give it 150% . If you're having a so-so day, say you're sick, they'll still call attention to you. They're not very demanding or hard on the average workers or workers doing the bare minimum. They are especially lenient during night shift, tons of employees standing around gossiping or complaining about \"working hard\" the full 4-5 hours while the few hard-workers are being put to do multiple duties.\r\n\r\n-They care a lot about scan rates. First month as a new hire, scan rate was 60/hour on the regular lines. Couple months after that 120/hour. A couple after that, 180-200 per hour. Changed without notice. You only have to worry about the scan rate if you're in the lower 10%.  You're still held accountable during low volume days. Say only 10 packages are coming down the line and there's about 15 people waiting for a package to come down from the belt, there's always that one person who wants to grab all 10 packages to keep their scan rate high and while everyone else's scan rates suffer and still get penalized for low scan rates.\r\n\r\n-Some managers and blue badges (permanent workers) are not nice and feel very entitled. There was a particular manager that would talk to people like they were dogs. \r\n\r\n-A lot of blue badges (permanent workers) and managers talk bad about the white badges (temps/seasonal). So expect them to find any little reason to criticize you or your work if you're seasonal/temp. Managers are very lenient to blue badges. Some of blue badges think they own certain lines and don't care to look at the roster to see where they've been placed to work for the day and will ask you to leave if you been placed in \"their\" line or tell the manager to move you. \r\n\r\n-Shift starts at a certain time but you're allowed to clock in up to 5 minutes before or after without penalty (i.e. shift start at 12:30, but can clock in at 12:25 or at 12:35). But they implicitly expect people to clock in at 12:25, so if you clock in at 12:28 and make it to stand-up at 12:30 they'll notice and most probably send you to inbound/outbound (load or unload trucks) even if you're hired as a sorter/scanner (if you don't mind, this might not be con for you).\r\n\r\n-Discount is only 10% off on amazon.com approved purchases not exceeding a total of $100 per year. But discount does not apply to seasonal/temps. No benefits whatsoever for temps.\r\n\r\n-Will change shift times for peak season. Got hired for certain shift times and worked school around that schedule. They said expect to work it until the end of peak season. Couple weeks in, they changed hours for peak and had to re-accommodate school and work hours.\r\n\r\n-Operate on a point system. If you get 5-5.5 points total, you get a write up; 6 points total, termination; 0.5 points if late less than an hour; 1.0 point if late more than an hour; 1.5 points if you miss your shift; points reset to 0 after 90 days from accrual date.\r\n\r\nOverall, working here wasn't hard if you do what you're supposed to do and it happened to work okay with school for me.

They see the people who are really grinding, so they'll always pick on you to work hard or to do extra work or warehouse duties. If you always give it 150%, they'll expect you to always give it 150% . If you're having a so-so day, say you're sick, they'll still call attention to you. They're not very demanding or hard on the average workers or workers doing the bare minimum. They are especially lenient during night shift, tons of employees standing around gossiping or complaining about \"working hard\" the full 4-5 hours while the few hard-workers are being put to do multiple duties.\r\n\r\n-They care a lot about scan rates. First month as a new hire, scan rate was 60/hour on the regular lines. Couple months after that 120/hour. A couple after that, 180-200 per hour. Changed without notice. You only have to worry about the scan rate if you're in the lower 10%.  You're still held accountable during low volume days. Say only 10 packages are coming down the line and there's about 15 people waiting for a package to come down from the belt, there's always that one person who wants to grab all 10 packages to keep their scan rate high and while everyone else's scan rates suffer and still get penalized for low scan rates.\r\n\r\n-Some managers and blue badges (permanent workers) are not nice and feel very entitled. There was a particular manager that would talk to people like they were dogs. \r\n\r\n-A lot of blue badges (permanent workers) and managers talk bad about the white badges (temps/seasonal). So expect them to find any little reason to criticize you or your work if you're seasonal/temp. Managers are very lenient to blue badges. Some of blue badges think they own certain lines and don't care to look at the roster to see where they've been placed to work for the day and will ask you to leave if you been placed in \"their\" line or tell the manager to move you. \r\n\r\n-Shift starts at a certain time but you're allowed to clock in up to 5 minutes before or after without penalty (i.e. shift start at 12:30, but can clock in at 12:25 or at 12:35). But they implicitly expect people to clock in at 12:25, so if you clock in at 12:28 and make it to stand-up at 12:30 they'll notice and most probably send you to inbound/outbound (load or unload trucks) even if you're hired as a sorter/scanner (if you don't mind, this might not be con for you).\r\n\r\n-Discount is only 10% off on amazon.com approved purchases not exceeding a total of $100 per year. But discount does not apply to seasonal/temps. No benefits whatsoever for temps.\r\n\r\n-Will change shift times for peak season. Got hired for certain shift times and worked school around that schedule. They said expect to work it until the end of peak season. Couple weeks in, they changed hours for peak and had to re-accommodate school and work hours.\r\n\r\n-Operate on a point system. If you get 5-5.5 points total, you get a write up; 6 points total, termination; 0.5 points if late less than an hour; 1.0 point if late more than an hour; 1.5 points if you miss your shift; points reset to 0 after 90 days from accrual date.\r\n\r\nOverall, working here wasn't hard if you do what you're supposed to do and it happened to work okay with school for me. There happens to be a lot of lazy people who don't want to put in the time and effort to work at a job *they* sought and applied to.  If everyone did there job, I feel that it would be more fair for everyone.

Low end employees while I worked there weren't really mistreated but largely ignored unless you had a problem.  I think Amazon is really working on improving the workplace atmosphere.

They would encourage you to come with them for issues but the problem is they would just repeatedly fix issues and not fix the root cause.

Whenever you address an issue that clearly exists that needs remedied on a larger scale to prevent other future issues middle management shrugs their shoulders and just says oh well.  And I have a distinct feeling that upper management probably doesn't care what the underlings say.  I find this indifference and ignorance odd since the whole company's mission statement is based on efficiency.  \r\n\r\nThere definitely are some bad managers who just need a whip and they'd crack it.  Although surprisingly I would say that was the exception more than the rule at this particular facility.  Be that as it may just more transparency and more respect for people who are obviously smarter than the rest of the work force would be nice.  There are plenty of people who are happy to just work their butts off and go unnoticed but if your someone who can figure out things on a larger scale and structure and see the inefficiencies or issues you will be very frustrated not only by realizing these things, but peoples indifference to their existence.  \r\n\r\nThen of course finally, work/life balance.

Safety seems to be a huge priority for Amazon, yet very little is exercised on the dock.

You will be tasked with filling multiple trailers, and god help you if they all get backed up (like they always do). If you are moderately ok at the job, you will be tasked with it more and more, instead of the job you were hired to do. The only way out of dock work is through a medical exemption - never mind that it is likely the most difficult and dangerous job in the facility.

I took this job because I was going through a difficult time and I thought that this would be what I needed. I quickly discovered this was not the case. My brain needs to be doing something productive at a job and it could not handle the tedium. \r\n\r\nThis job involves taking boxes off of a belt and stacking them on a pellet to be shipped. Let me be clear, there are other positions but the vast majority of the employees are forced to be scanners during their shifts. This wouldn't be nearly as stressful if the other people scanning in your lane would actually stack the boxes properly. A normal person knows that it is not that difficult to stack boxes so that they don't fall down, but I do not think I was working with normal people. They would throw the boxes on the pellets and then throw boxes on top of the corner of a box. No they would not take the second required to sit the box on a flat surface, it was too much work for them. In the end you would have a six foot leaning Tower of Pisa falling on an associate because everyone was too lazy to do their jobs right. Then a water spider, the person who wraps and labels the packages for shipping, would have to rebuild the pellet by themselves. One person had to correct the carelessness of eight people. It would have taken those eight but a few seconds to do their jobs right the first time but instead one person had to waste minutes fixing the problem. Lest you think this to be a minor annoyance, there were about ninety pellets per lane that were falling over and needed to be fixed. Ninety pellets that one person had to fix.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to fix the pellets because I can't do my job improperly I was told to stop and let the water spiders do it.

You can always learn but if you just don't care then there will never be improvement.\r\n\r\nThere is a board where the associates could make suggestions for improvement to management, but of course they were largely ignored. Training all of the employees on pellet building would have taken five minutes. They take longer than that to stretch and make announcements prior to the start of the shift.\r\n\r\nI almost forgot to mention that you will be hired for and accept a shift that you schedule your life around only to find out on your first day that they changed your shift and didn't feel the need to inform you. I was not the only person they did this to. I spoke to other people who had gone through this. Then they tell you that you have to wait ninety days before you can request a shift change.\r\n\r\nThe pay is about twelve dollars an hour for a guaranteed eighteen hours. Amazon tells you that you cannot have a second job with their approval because your life has to revolve around Amazon. I don't know how anyone can afford to live on eighteen hours a week.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Amazon fulfillment centers are a wonderful place to work if you are apathetic, male and have no career aspirations. It is a very sexist environment and they do not respect their employees.

They will train you well.\r\n\r\n- You will develop 'much' faster hand/eye coordination and reaction time based on Brand/Size/Color/Label, even if you are color blind.    \r\n\r\n- The workers and 'good PAs/Managers' are often very cool down to earth people with a wide spectrum of life experiences and beliefs, which can be really awesome.\r\n\r\n- The Core Ethics and Moral principles of Amazon are profound and inspiring and on every break room wall.\r\n\r\n- You get awesome pay during official holidays. (Thanksgiving and Christmas.)   Especially if you do overtime.   I earned nearly $30 an hour during peak time on holidays with overtime.    \"Thats\" where the gravy is.\r\n\r\n- Free Coffee in the Break Rooms.    This will aid you in your quest to make it through 10-12 hour shifts.     It is dangerous to go alone, drink this!\r\n\r\n- People often write hilarious things on the totes. (But management fights this and covers the totes.)\r\n\r\n- Some managers can be really funny and cool people.\r\n\r\n- SDF8 has Smash Bros. 'and' Guitar Hero in the break room, with all their DLC.\r\n\r\n- Supposedly Dogs check the facility for and eradicate 'all' the dust mites.   According to our management at SDF8.    (Note: We've never seen said dogs, and CERN/DARPA are curious as to these 0-Dust Environments despite warehouse settings, as scientists have yet to achieve this in labs.)\r\n\r\n- If you are not an American Citizen you can get away with most anything at Amazon, as long as they can't talk with you.   They'll generally not enforce it and \"go out of their way\" to avoid getting you deported home because 'that is mean'.     ... Hurray...?\r\n\r\n- Amazon is accepting of culture, almost dangerously so.    I masqueraded as a \"Jedi Knight\" for months in various jedi robes and due to Islamic people rocking Burkas I was unharassed for it and even praised for my dedication to the Jedi Way.       \r\n\r\n- You will find some of the most ridiculous and hilarious products you have ever seen.   Also, you'll know 'everything' society buys and how often.\r\n\r\n- If you're on top of your life, your life situation, your bills, and everything is golden in your life.   Amazon can be a great place to work, because then $12.50 an hour + benefits and little time/room to grow but plenty of opportunites for random VTO/PTO/UPT  is right up your alley!!    Because fortunately across the year there's many opportunities for 'free time off', a rare commodity at jobs.\r\n\r\nPRO'S Closing: Would I recommend this to a friend?   Yes!    For the long term?   No!!      Amazon is the kind of business where I feel Jeff expects the worker to be business savvy/smart and play their cards at \"His\" table.       Jeff/Amazon offers workers help with moving/homes and education and his Health benefits are 'incredible' speaking as someone denied them at most lower end jobs.       Come to Amazon expecting to: Capitalize as much as possible on Health benefits/Peak Seasons and then if you're able to get a easier going job the rest of the year until peak areas roll back around.     Don't be a Winter Soldier like myself and hustle it the entire year unless you find you love it, and it works for you.    \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: AMAZON IS NOT FOR EVERYONE; it is a very hard job, but if you're a young hard worker and you don't want to flip patties and you are in a dark place -- I'd definitely throw Jeff and Amazon your way before I would any fast food place.    Even with this full report.   But i'm sending you towards them honest, don't go expecting a easy ride.", "cons": "- You will likely start as a PICKER; the grunts/backbone of Amazon itself, they walk between 9-12 miles a night (Average rates) to between 12-20 miles a night.  On foot.   (200-300% rate.)  The latter figure of 20 is extremely hard/rare, but we've had some absurd workers in the past.\r\n\r\n- Do not bother trying to get Pickers/Packers/Stowers/Throwers/Floor Blowers/Wall spiders/anything more money.    Amazons' Management don't see a +250% efficiency for 50% more pay that day as a \"Lucrative exchange\".     Despite the math being there.   Amazon as mentioned in the Pro's is fortunately great for slacking, but if you're a hard worker like myself you don't get any true recognition or reward for it.   \r\n\r\n- Hard workers get promoted less due to being 'Too valuable' in the work horse positions.\r\n\r\n- If you work night-shift your only compensation 'most of the year' is a 0.50 cent pay differential with is a minor pittance considering EVERYTHING IS CLOSED during the night, so on your days off (nights) you can't do anything besides Wal-mart and Walgreens.    Really this should be more a $2-3 differential, I can't even take a date to a not-tacobell place unless I am staying up to what would be 4:15 AM for most people.\r\n\r\n- You will realize you can never afford most of the crazy products you're collecting often times, and especially not the $475 tuxedo for 4 month old babies or $125 \"Her Secret\" man thong or any of the various crazy products.\r\n\r\n- You'll be drug tested up to every four months.   I do no drugs so this wasn't an issue beyond it being extremely unethical, a total invasion of peoples' privacy, and frankly none of the companys' business unless I was involved in some form of violation or accident.   They also don't drug test management/corporate, cute huh?   (Which is generous to say if you know the law, because even 'then' it isn't their business what you do outside of work.)\r\n\r\n- No drinks on the floor, even if it's a twist/seal container?   You may have water, but chances are you don't want 10-12 hours of Water.     Pee-breaks can also get you fired if you forget to take note of them and have proof they were infact for bodily functions and not 'shenanigans'.\r\n\r\n- The rate is argued to be 'very hard' for most people, being a ectomorph myself I find it easy to maintain.    But my frame/build/muscle tone are all ideal for this job, so that's a rigged standard.\r\n\r\n- Not enough time on breaks to really bother with the video games in the one break room, and you may not even be at a area close enough to 'go to that room'.\r\n\r\n- Working harder gets you... nothing.    Absolutely nothing, you won't get priority for Voluntary Time Off, Increased Raises, Promotions, Shift Changes, Shift Transfers, or anything.     You won't even get more voice in meetings and may be stuck listening to old people worry how Amazon might protect them from Rhinos or mad Gunmen rather than work situations and human rights infringements.\r\n\r\n- Worst pay in my area for warehouses, despite being owned by the World's Richest Man.  (12.50 an hour versus many here being 16+; and YES, it makes it that much worse my boss has so much money that he could make our lives golden.)\r\n\r\n- Management has poor Legal Knowledge.  \r\n   - This leads to many violations you shouldn't have, and high-school bully esque \r\n     reactions to workers who would exercise their human rights to say \"Sir you \r\n     can't do X due to Y law/policy.\"    Sometimes people aren't being sassy, they're \r\n     being matter-of-fact and are well within their rights.\r\n\r\n  - Management has a habit of dishonesty.\r\n       - This tends to be in the lower management and corporate seems unaware, but\r\n          the effects vary from misquoting rules/laws/policies, to bouncing people \r\n          between HR and area heads long enough to get them fired, to stating things                                                                     \r\n          that are impossible like \"Amazon has no dust or dust mites because we bring \r\n          in dogs.\"      \r\n        - This perpetuates a concern/feeling in workers that the managers believe \r\n           they're unable to figure out 3rd grade level science facts or basic math in \r\n           other instances.\r\n\r\n- In Indiana at least, some locations deny electronics up to and including any music and/or phones.     This can be problematic if you have to take care of anyone or live in a rough neighborhood where you're \"always\" an emergency number, or if you have a side job with anything of note and have to be able to be notified if there's some manner of emergency alert.     But y'know, you're at 12.50 amazon, you can't risk their important profits with someones' life, right?\r\n\r\n- Workers are treated like criminals, and management will even openly admit the intent and reasoning is just that;  the managements' reasons at SDF8 in Indiana for metal detectors and air-port level security was \"We are concerned workers may be taking photographs or footage of working conditions.\" with other colorful statements like, \"We often have workers steal products from the facility and we wish to minimize that.\" (Despite metal detectors not helping with clothes their #1 product at said place?) \r\n\r\n-  You will bottom out in pay increases at Tier 3; it doesn't matter how much you know, don't know, train, or don't train -- your pay will be relatively X at that time and won't raise again.     Note, this is technically good too, but capping at roughly 15.50 isn't exactly shooting for the stars.\r\n\r\n- Many holidays aren't \"considered holidays\" at Amazon, despite increased work load and adverse treatment for those days.\r\n\r\n- For your birthday round table they'll mostly want free Safety Engineering advice and they'll give you a cookie that has more cheap frosting than one of those Wal-mart cakes.    So if you were expecting them to 'really' care about those ideas you spent all year formulating and perfecting, they don't.    They want free Safety Engineering Advice or Management Tips so they don't get fired.\r\n\r\n- Management can be flawed in human ways, and may have achieved that position through the \"Good Ol' Boy\" system we don't see much post 2010ish.    Normally I wouldn't mention this as a issue, but AMAZON is so computer automated that if you spend even 2-3 months there you will understand when I say \"A Robot could be our overlord.\",  being able to say this i'm content in saying we'd prefer a Robotic Overlord that's neutral and impartial to our feelings and just wants good results than a tyrant that passes prejudicial and personally charged rules that are mentally unsound.    It is 2017 and it begs to reason a manager should be able to let a person with 250% Efficiency Rating have music if they want.\r\n\r\n- Less pay or Respect than other warehouses.     The first, being I make 12.50 an hour is easy to understand, the latter takes a bit more finesse and understanding the job/routine.    The stand up's consist of being reminded safety rules you'd expect to be hear preached daily to toddlers not so much grown adults with pearls such as, \"Don't drop 90 lbs boxes on your head.\",  \"Don't drink the Purrell from the Bottles.\", \"Don't fall down the stairs or leap over the 2nd, 3rd, 4th floor balconies.\", and one of my favorites \"Don't try to ride your push cart down the steps.\"        I understand some one must of done some of these, but you insult people when you bring something it took an oaf to do and ask the majority not to do it.\r\n\r\n- They won't give you your full 15 minute break, rather they expect you to only use 15 minutes total.     This sounds reasonable until you recall the SDF8 mantra they proudly chant of \"WE'RE BIGGER THAN 28 FOOTBALL FIELDS!!!\"   Yeah, if you're in a corner it can take up to 5-6 minutes at Athletic Power Walking speeds to get there; that's possibly only 4 minutes to sit if you get 'sent back' to that same area.   And you might not even know where you get sent, so good luck timing that.   (P.S - This can get you fired.)\r\n\r\n- Management and HR 'do not' communicate.      HR themselves will tell you this.    On the surface it sounds unrealistic until we recall this is a several thousand person 24/7 warehouse that never sleeps.     It \"cant\" communicate that well because it's a hulking monster in size.    This leads to more head aches for the little guys than it 'ever' could for bosses.      Sometimes HR will try to avoid their job and send you to 'your manager' who assuming they're working will 'Send you to HR' who will then ask you to verify with your manager again... And it bears pointing out these people HAVE radios for each other.\r\n\r\n- Amazon is by default a Hostile Work Environment legally going by the fact so many Visa Workers CAN NOT COMMUNICATE.      Anyone wanting to doubt this?    I'll let you guess how many 3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10x lingual people Amazon can or would afford to employ, and now guess how many are on my Night shift.   Yeah.   that's right, people who speak 3+ languages with some being exotic and rare DONT WORK for places like Amazon just to translate for a $4.50 an hour worker, the nice/professional way to put this is your rights get violated because Amazon wants to save some cash.   And believe me, many English workers get fired over \"Time off Task\" on the chaos/confusion/blockades these immigrants cause.\r\n\r\n- Management won't punish the people they can't speak with, and sometimes have no one on any shift to do it and they'll just let it sit until the \"Case goes Cold\".    This isn't accusing racism/discrimination persay so much as saying 'Guys given they're all from X foreign country, this looks REALLY bad that it's only them and a similar group getting exemption.'     Again, this isn't saying they're being unfair intentionally -- but expect it to happen, because imagine yourself in the managers' shoes...  It's messy.\r\n\r\n- Power Hour rewards often are VERY poor, with first place being $10; less than you make in an hour to exhaust yourself.    And it's in the form of a vending machine voucher.     And they probably forgot you won or announced it a week late and you're getting nothing.    Congratulations.\r\n\r\n - I was banned from the Discord Global Fitness channel for allegedly impossible feats of strength in terms of my daily walk rates across my time working for Amazon.    They accused me of trolling.    I am still banned.    I did not lie.\r\n\r\n- Despite many efforts Amazon realized determination doesn't cure colorblindness, but even so expect them to try with you if you are by sending you to the color coded jewelry section.     Where they'll arrive within a few hours to ask why you are incompetent. \r\n\r\n- Does not live up to or reinforce fulfillment of it's Core Ethics and Moral Principles.\r\n\r\n- Denies most holidays are infact holidays, meaning you don't get holiday pay for them despite it obviously being a national if not global event.\r\n\r\n- Has some of the most dangerous step ladders you will ever encounter.   This is due to it being so many people using them so often, so much, with little/no maintenance on them so you end up with mal-folding death machines.   \r\n\r\n- Jeff Bezos is either criminally negligent of the disparity in earnings between his shareholders/owners/workers and his management/self/company or he just doesn't care.    This is a problem because men as great/powerful as him need to help the world get better, not make it worse.    Jeff doesn't realize he has more than enough money and he just won't pay his workers more."}, {"review_title": "Lack of collaboration. Engineering focused. Poor design standards outside of main orgs.

They've had success in multiple verticals and are continuously expanding into others. If you're working in one of those new verticals, it's exciting to see what will come out of it.\r\n\r\nPeople are getting more excited about Amazon because they are taking bigger swings (Whole Foods, online pharmacy, Twitch, etc.) from which they have a compelling foundation to build off of (e-commerce) which is different than other big tech companies. The stock has been soaring and general sentiment of financial analysts have been good. The company is continually expanding within Seattle, is opening a second HQ, and continues to grow internationally. Overall, there's always a feeling while working at Amazon that something crazy new or exciting is happening somewhere.", "cons": "People, teams, and organizations work in silos. This is common at large companies, but the degree in which it happens at Amazon is extreme. I can count numerous examples from the different teams I've been on and worked together with in which people on the same team are completely unaware of what each other were doing. The worst example of this was two different product managers on the same team getting two different sets of engineers to accomplish the same exact large scale task. This is so engrained into the Amazon culture, that people will see situations like this, laugh it off, and accept it as normal. Many people still save design source files and Word/Excel documents to their computer and share them out via email if you know to ask. To compound this problem, Amazon is so freaking cheap that they give all employees 1 GB of email storage, which is less than basically every free email service provider in the world. Cloud-based and collaborative work processes are still foreign concepts to many in Amazon.\r\n\r\nEngineering is clearly more powerful than product and design, and a lot of time on both product and design teams are wasted because engineering has final says on almost everything. A lot of the existing internal tools and infrastructure at Amazon are created and designed by engineers without the end user in mind. This has been normal at Amazon for over 20 years and isn\u2019t changing without some kind of high-level intervention. Because of that, the only teams with decent design teams and designs are in the most successful consumer facing products: the e-commerce site, devices/Lab126, Amazon Video, and Amazon Music. Don\u2019t even bother joining other design teams if you care about making good designs. Amazon's strength is e-commerce, so they have a poor foundation for serving up digital services (communication, social, productivity, etc.) like the ones Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. have. Many digital services and products that aren't tied to the e-commerce site are inferior in engineering, product, and design.\r\n\r\nThe quality of life at Amazon is poor compared to other companies you can work at. I haven\u2019t seen instances as bad as the New York Times article where people are crying at their desks or screaming at each other, but there are definitely many people who are grumpy or frustrated. You are expected to bootstrap and be self-reliant. It really comes across as an excuse to do the bare minimum to support employees. Company training for new employees is half a day long, and then it all depends on what your organization and team have set up for you. If they set nothing up for you, well... you\u2019re on your own. This would be more acceptable if more IT, support, and security staff were more helpful. Many (not all) are disgruntled with a poor attitude. However these employees are also just given the bare minimum to accomplish their jobs, so they have some right to be moody. The bootstrapping mindset, the lack of resources and support, the focus on doing more with less, and the overabundance of work has led to a culture where people don\u2019t actively help or collaborate with one another because they have too much to deal with. Some people are genuinely nice and want to be helpful and collaborative, but they can\u2019t because they\u2019re too busy. Then you\u2019re left with the jerks who don\u2019t want to be either and don't care if they set up giant roadblocks in your way to get anything done.\r\n\r\nThe leadership principles are celebrated by employees, but are easy to be interpreted in multiple conflicting ways, like any other cult or religion. What is deemed \"right\" usage of leadership principles is mostly from those most charismatic, most experienced, or most masculine. Most of Amazon's leadership posts are held by men who've been at Amazon long, so the leadership principles skew heavily toward masculine values and mindsets. Uber\u2019s former cultural values and former CEO were heavily influenced by Amazon\u2019s, and you can see where that got them. The frugality leadership principle gets ridiculous to a point where they will save a couple bucks, even if it means giving employees more headaches. An easy example of this is not stocking certain cables with IT or even basic supplies in the office supply rooms. Sure you might save dollars on not buying them, but if your designer, product manager, or engineer need to leave the office to buy some, you\u2019re actually losing money. Oh and that dumb 1 GB of email storage. IT tells you to essentially adopt an OCD email management approach in order to fit into the 1 GB limit.

You will be recognized as a \u201cleader\u201d and be promoted despite your experience or lack of skills.", "cons": "Horrible place to work if you\u2019re already established in your career, have a family, or enjoy unplugging from work long enough to enjoy your evenings, weekends, holidays or vacations.  Amazon is not a family friendly company, despite what they say to the contrary.  You\u2019re penalized for working from home even if there is a legitimate reason even if you\u2019re more productive there than at the office.\r\n\r\nAmazon also holds onto the delusion that they are a start-up going after the big players in the market.  They\u2019re not.  They are a mature \u201cbig player\u201d company pretending to be start-up.  All of the tools and data are home-grown; that translates into lots of bugs, inconsistent data, lack of a clear owner or desire by owners to maintain or fix their software/data, and catalog data that is lacking on details or consistency.  This last point is important.  If you\u2019re the kind of person that loves making up data to suit your hypothesis, this is the place for you.  If, however, you\u2019re bugged by the inconsistencies you see from the same data sets but with different interpretations, you will be plagued with indecision and lack of confidence on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nBe prepared during your tenure to have your self-confidence and self-esteem battered on a daily basis.  The position you\u2019re applying for now will not be the same one you\u2019ll be performing on a daily basis.  You will be doing menial tasks daily, predominantly data entry, data validation, report generation and ticket resolution (and that\u2019s if you\u2019re a business owner like a vendor manager or product manager).  In any given week, you\u2019ll have about 8 hours total that you\u2019ll be able to devote to your actual job, though you can easily do 40 hours a week if you work evenings and weekends.\r\n\r\nAmazon\u2019s strategy for attracting the best and the brightest is to hire in the cream of the crop from colleges around the country, suck the creative juices and ideas out of their employees, then toss them aside with no clear path to career succession while they go ply the universities for other unsuspecting candidates.  Their restricted stock plan is designed in such a way that you get trivially small amounts of stock in your first two years before it balloons for another two years.  They do this because most people that go to Amazon leave or get fired between the first and second year.\r\n\r\nCompetition is fierce at Amazon.  Not just between Amazon and the outside world, or between the various Amazon teams, but within your own team.  You will be forced to compete in terms of your effectiveness or production rate with your co-workers and you will be publically called out for not achieving arbitrary goals.  The definition of \u201cproductive\u201d is also a very arbitrary term at Amazon.  You can have someone that does the bare minimum, who gets others to fix the problems they cause and who claim credit for work others did get called an \u201ceffective leader\u201d and get promoted.  You also get folks that work hard, long hours, usually 10 or 12 hours a day, late into the night, on weekends and holidays, who don\u2019t take vacation, who then get fired within their first year because they weren\u2019t \u201cproductive\u201d enough.\r\n\r\nAmazon is highly fractured internally, with each group given a set of goals to achieve that are not aligned at the corporate level.  The result is that you have groups duplicating the work of others, building solutions that solve their immediate need but create more work or disrupt business processes for others, and management groups often make poor business decisions because the mid-tier managers tend to only talk about the wins, not about the blockers or issues.  Amazon, as a whole, is highly dis-functional whose mandate of becoming the largest online seller of \u201cstuff\u201d in the world has certainly made them successful externally, but has created a huge list of issues and process misses internally.  Unless major amounts of resources are devoted to resolving the business processes and data integrity issues within the next few years, Amazon will see an increase in employee satisfaction, and higher costs of doing business (due to hiring in people to maintain antiquated data schemas and coding band-aid solutions rather than scraping the entire system for something much more scalable and less prone to bug defects).\r\n\r\nIf you do get hired, you will have a significant ramp-up period on the order of six to nine months.  Nothing is well documented at Amazon, despite their assertion that the Wiki has the information you need (which was true when they created the page two years ago but doesn\u2019t reflect the actual state of affairs today), so you will have to train yourself on how to use the tools or from your co-workers if you\u2019re lucky enough they can pull themselves away from their data processing long enough to help you."}, {"review_title": "A behemoth with a decent soul.

It's all done by numbers so if you ar not making numbers for whatever reason or you have any mistake to be held against you will find your chances are slim to none in getting hired.\r\n\r\nYou are expendable - As a seasonal employee, you will find that they will hire on more \"white badges\" or seasonal employees than they need and cut them just as quickly. There will be equipment and processes you will not get trained in and thus will have to rely upon other hard pressed associates to assist you, however they will have to do it on their time and during which your work suffers and reflects poorly upon you.

You may be then encouraged by other associates to cut corners which then puts ou in the position of getting in trouble or terminate in the future. An example is you need to move an item from one floor to the other via an elevator or VRC that requires special certification to operate. To wait on management will cause you to accrue Time Off Task or TOT and also lowere your \"rate\" which is a number that measures productivity. If you abandon the work it may or may not be later tied to you and if you are caught operating the VRC you are likely to be terminated.\r\n\r\nFatigue - When they say you will be on your feet all day they mean it.

The annual planning process, OP1, lets front-line teams and leadership prioritize what projects are important and what gets funded, but for most teams it's common to see more than half of potential projects not rise above the \"funded\" line, just because there is so much that can be done, including what other teams might want from you. So even when you're a rockstar and finish a project early and under budget, the next project is always ready to go. \r\n\r\nBeyond that, I often see new Amazonians ramping up into 50-60 hour weeks on their own. Sometimes this is because they think they need to prove something, but more often it's new college hires who don't yet know how to communicate delays or un-achievable dates.  They're used to college courses with pre-validated and reasonable work, and usually still need to learn how to tell a manager that a project is underestimated or a new requirement will cause the date to slip. \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve a happy work/life balance, you have to practice and get good at saying \"no\": no to your manager when asked if a date can be hit, and no to yourself when confronted with a project that you want to (or feel like you should) work on at the expense of your night or weekend.

The annual planning process, OP1, lets front-line teams and leadership prioritize what projects are important and what gets funded, but for most teams it's common to see more than half of potential projects not rise above the \"funded\" line, just because there is so much that can be done, including what other teams might want from you. So even when you're a rockstar and finish a project early and under budget, the next project is always ready to go. \r\n\r\nBeyond that, I often see new Amazonians ramping up into 50-60 hour weeks on their own. Sometimes this is because they think they need to prove something, but more often it's new college hires who don't yet know how to communicate delays or un-achievable dates.  They're used to college courses with pre-validated and reasonable work, and usually still need to learn how to tell a manager that a project is underestimated or a new requirement will cause the date to slip. \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve a happy work/life balance, you have to practice and get good at saying \"no\": no to your manager when asked if a date can be hit, and no to yourself when confronted with a project that you want to (or feel like you should) work on at the expense of your night or weekend.

In practice, this means that software engineers are on-call for a week, and have to get up in the night to answer any issues that come up. Not so bad if you are on a 8 person team, which means you have to do this once every two months, but really bad if you are on a 3 person team.  This burns people out pretty badly, and leads to bad code - you can't focus if you were up all night.\r\n\r\nAn arrogant believe that Amazon engineers are better than almost anywhere else.  I've worked at a lot of good companies, and while the new college hires are natively bright and talented, many of them are inexperienced. Amazon doesn't seem to have a lot of engineers with 10-12 years of experience, who could grow the skills of these talented newbies. I've been in places with much better engineers. But I've heard Amazon middle management claim that they can pull off extremely ambitious schedules because they have Amazon engineers. \r\n\r\nPressure.... pressure .... pressure.

I can't speak for the software developers, those in other segments outside of the Amazon.com retail business (for example Amazon Prime, Amazon Web Services, or company subsidiaries), or those not in the corporate HQ in Seattle (such as fulfillment center associates). \r\n\r\n- Zero work/life balance. \r\nEveryone is expected to take their work home. Management pretends to care and tells you to not overwork, but if you don't work weekends you'll get fired. I've received a phone call at 4 AM from work. Insane infringement on your personal life. \r\n\r\n- The culture is toxic. \r\nOn average people quit after just two years. That isn't normal for any company. It's a revolving door. After just one year of employment, half my team was already junior to me. People either quit or get fired. Everyone is afraid of getting fired and discuss it frequently when management isn't around. It's really sad. \r\n\r\n- The company is incredibly disorganized, the work day is chaotic. \r\nThere is an appalling lack of training, people don't know how to do their jobs and are being taught by others who have only been with the company for a grand total of 3 months. The tools you need to do your job are poorly developed and often break down or have limited usefulness, leading to unnecessary low productivity which you are blamed for. Systems are constantly changing and no one knows how to use the new versions - some people like this because they want innovation, but the truth is the company is so large now that you really don't have much freedom to innovate. There is a huge clash between a start-up mentality and a bureaucratic corporate culture. \r\n\r\n- Management is poor quality, and downright nasty. \r\nMany are not qualified to do their job, lacking proper experience. For instance, some were on a management rotational program that put them in 3 very different roles over 3 short years, while they had no background in any of those functions. It was a joke working under those types because they knew just as much about their job as you did. I witnessed senior managers being brought into the company and being \"trained\" by their reports. Upper level management is completely inhumane - they treat people like machines / slaves / farm animals, despite that many of my peers were incredibly bright and talented people from strong backgrounds and with good educations (Ivy leagues and other Top 25 schools). Management never recognized people for their contributions and hard work, leading to low morale. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I'd say that the high employee turnover is evidence enough of the lack of work/life balance and the toxic and chaotic work environment perpetuated by bad management. As I mentioned above, after just one year, I was already more senior than half my team. Everyone I had known was gone, and I was training the newcomers.

Noise level is terrible because of overcrowded office with ridiculously noisy SDEs who have no notion that there may be somebody who needs a quiet environment for his work. We don't have access to academic journals and conference papers, and we need to ask people in academia to get a copy, which I believe is against the policy of publishers. 3yr vesting of 401k matching contributions was what I did not know before I left and what I regret the most. \r\n\r\nAmazon claims itself to be the world's most costumer-centric company. That in turn implies it does not care much about the employees. Basically, employees are dispensable and replaceable. \r\n\r\nCompany is not investing enough for its internal infrastructures, because they are not directly connected to customer satisfaction. Databases have much less processing capacity than what is needed; the situation worsened much more since 2013 and it is not a surprise if it takes more than a few hours to run a very simple SQL query. I wonder how people, especially data scientist type of people, do their work with such a poor environment. \r\n\r\nNote that work environments for research scientists may be quite different depending on what area you are in. For machine learning and computer vision researchers, the company seems to be relaxing its strict policy on publications. However, on more traditional supply chain area that I was in, nothing seems to be changing; after all, we are probably not doing state-of-the-art research that is worth publishing. We are just coming up with ad-hoc patches for problems, without understanding anything and accumulating any knowledge.\r\n\r\nPromotions are rare and it looks tougher for research scientists compared to SDEs. While SDEs have clearer measurements on their work, it is often unclear how to measure the contribution of research scientists' work. Management, which is dominated by MBA-type of people, does not understand the value of long-term research and they are only looking at short-term cost savings, which are often estimated based on dubious calculations using inaccurate financial figures.\r\n\r\nThere is no career path for research scientists. Internal transfers to other groups should be a good opportunity for employees to grow, but from my experiences, people are generally narrow-minded and reject you when you do not have past experiences in the exact area, even if you have good records of performance reviews. They basically treat you as just another external candidate. \r\n\r\nOne last thing. My employment was terminated 2 days after I submitted a formal letter of resignation, even though I was requesting to leave one week later. Not only I lost 1 week of income, I also lost health insurance coverage one month earlier, because I would have been covered until the end of month if I quitted in the beginning of the month as I planned, but they have \"fired\" me in the end of previous month and the insurance was terminated at the same time. I didn't even have an exit interview. I couldn't believe how badly the company treats me after more than 2 years of service. Beware, because this can happen to a person like me, who was performing well enough to get promoted just several months ago.

Daily or twice a day status updates in terms of full fledged presentations are not uncommon.\r\n\r\nCompany benefits. Not a huge decision factor but helps team bonding to be better in other companies that what I have seen in Amazon. One of the Amazon principles are \"frugal\" which was later changed to \"do more with less\". Meaning that they are not spending money on comfort items like \"economy plus\" tickets for long haul business flights,   decent cafeteria food vendors,  snacks, beverages, subsidized food for late night overtime work, health activities and other small benefits that helps increase employee satisfaction. Team building activities and events are under tight budget restrictions normally limiting it to affordable dinner and movie tickets. Although employees aren't paid to have fun at the office, they are there to work there is a certain lack of camaraderie in Amazon groups and organization that I have always experienced in other companies which I think is a factor to some people when deciding who to work for as you will be spending a substantial part of your life in the office.\r\n\r\nExpectation is that you bring work with you home and can support late night calls on a daily basis. If you are an exempt employee you should be prepared to explain and justify why you are not available outside office hours and weekends to  support standby and crunch work.\r\n\r\nPlease note that you are willing to adjust to these expectations you have great growth opportunities but it might not be for everyone.

Daily or twice a day status updates in terms of full fledged presentations are not uncommon.\r\n\r\nCompany benefits. Not a huge decision factor but helps team bonding to be better in other companies that what I have seen in Amazon. One of the Amazon principles are \"frugal\" which was later changed to \"do more with less\". Meaning that they are not spending money on comfort items like \"economy plus\" tickets for long haul business flights,   decent cafeteria food vendors,  snacks, beverages, subsidized food for late night overtime work, health activities and other small benefits that helps increase employee satisfaction. Team building activities and events are under tight budget restrictions normally limiting it to affordable dinner and movie tickets. Although employees aren't paid to have fun at the office, they are there to work there is a certain lack of camaraderie in Amazon groups and organization that I have always experienced in other companies which I think is a factor to some people when deciding who to work for as you will be spending a substantial part of your life in the office.\r\n\r\nExpectation is that you bring work with you home and can support late night calls on a daily basis. If you are an exempt employee you should be prepared to explain and justify why you are not available outside office hours and weekends to  support standby and crunch work.\r\n\r\nPlease note that you are willing to adjust to these expectations you have great growth opportunities but it might not be for everyone. What I have seen it mostly employees with small kids or sick family members getting bad reviews for not being \"team players\" or supporting conference calls in other time zones or putting in the \"informal standard\" 50 hour work week and more during crunch times."}, {"review_title": "Unless you just can't find a job any place else run the other direction", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Jun 2016", "job_title": "Former Customer Service Manager in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits are awesome.

I'll start with the nit pick then move on to the more in depth nonsense that they pull. \r\n\r\nLike a lot of people have said, your breaks are more like 10 minutes and lunches are pretty short too. There's so many safety hazards that if someone from OSHA came in they'd have a heart attack. They purposely frown upon any bit of succor (sitting on ladder, sitting on the floor, etc) or breaks (bathroom breaks and normal timed breaks) that they'll get onto you about it.  They literally want you to be a robot, and if not you will be fired or written up.  Within my month in a half of working there, this is what I experienced;\r\n\r\nWhen I was first hired I was very excited, and despite what people have said I wanted to be optimistic. I was originally trained to become a stower, but after 2 weeks I was switched to counter. There were many instances where the management seemed to pick on certain people to succeed, or to fail. I was one that they wanted to stay and I think the reason why is because I'm young and a fast worker. My coworker on the other hand that was older but able to follow the same pace as I. The entire time I saw management talk to him or about him they would either be giving a write up or a talking to despite us working the same pace (which was at the speed that they had told us they wanted). After that, all the older people that I had trained with were either getting write ups or quitting because the work was too much. Already, within the 2nd week they were weeding people out. It bothered me, but since they weren't focused on me I just kept doing my job.\r\n\r\nNow, a month has passed and I'm getting sick of working here and it's showing. I have a very good work ethic so even when I do hate a job I will do my best no matter what and that's what I did.  By this mark most of the people I trained with disappeared and one of the lasts was on his second write up.  Peak season is also starting soon, and so everyone on that shift in the morning has to meet in the main break rooms. Its the usual 'be safe' meetings one can imagine, and they're playing videos to demonstrate, towards the end though is when things got.. Interesting. A video starts up and it's talking about our wages. The video then goes on to tell us that we're paid 12 an hour starting out and every 6 months we gain like 50 cents to a max of like 14 an hour I think. That's.. Not true. That's not true at all. I have a friend who's worked here for a year and a half and he's only paid 11.50. Everyone in the room is mumbling uncomfortably and the people giving the presentation don't even mention it and moved on the next video.  After that they used this guilt trip tactic to tell this story on how a kid wanted a blue firetruck for his birthday, we messed up and gave him a red one and now his birthday was ruined. It's pathetic. That entire morning was a pathetic way to work even harder than what we already are working. They absolutely do not care about you and will not even bother learning your name and instead will call you sir or ma'am. Now for the conspiracy part.\r\n\r\nTo put it short, they hire anyone for 2 weeks, you mess up at all within those 2 weeks you're written up. When you're written up its already too late for you and they will purposely mess you over and get you to either quit or fire within that month. They hire people every day it seems so you're easily replaceable. Everyone is, including management. Everyone is for themselves and they will gladly mess the next person over to get in their numbers, They just repeat this formula over and over again and maybe, maybe if you're a very devoted person you'll stay. \r\n\r\nI haven't even gone into the actual work of it which by itself is easy but at the pace they want it isn't. Out of the 3000+ bins I scanned as a counter I messed up 17 times, doing the math I messed up .56% and I was written up. They're that cut throat about it.

In that sense, it would be accurate to think of Amazon as a collection of loosely affiliated startups, which sometime overlap in scope, with a shared goal of doing right by our customers.", "cons": "All the cons associated with working at Amazon ultimately tie back to our leadership principle of Frugality. The company simply doesn't care about the wellbeing of its employees, even if it results in hurting overall productivity and morale. \r\n\r\nComputer equipment is the first example: while the company has improved somewhat over the years in terms of giving engineers a choice between a Mac and a PC, as well as the right to having two monitors, employees still don't have any say in truly choosing the equipment that will make them successful (don't expect to receive a yearly hardware budget like what other tech companies offer). Need a standup desk? Not until you complete multiple ergonomic assessments with months-long waitlists before seeing a specialist. Many will counter that you have the option to get around company policies by expensing the equipment you need through your manager, but this unfortunately turns into a case-by-case situation, and a manager facing budget pressures may be less willing to accommodate employees in this way. \r\n\r\nSpace is another example: while company policies claim that corporate employees are entitled to a cubicle or shared office, the reality is that almost every individual contributor works in a high-density environment where co-workers are seated incredibly close to one another. To compensate for the noise and distractions associated with this setup, the company provides a DISCOUNT on Bose headphones, which some employees take advantage of. Though we are told that the space issues are caused by Amazon's fast pace of hiring, the problem has been getting worse for the last several years, and most new buildings that come up in Seattle don't even bother installing a reasonable number of offices and cubicles, opting instead for completely open space seating with minimal numbers of low partitions between team areas. Amazon also fails to provide free parking to its employees, though it is possible to get on a year-long waiting list for paid monthly parking, which recently increased in price to $150/month. \r\n\r\nThe last example is compensation. Base salaries at Amazon are incredibly low when compared to the rest of the tech industry. No one in the company makes more than $170K per year in base salary, with most engineers receiving from $100K to $150K. To be fair, the company does provide RSUs, which have a vesting period of 2 years. What has been frustrating about being paid mostly in RSUs is that the shares you take home one year are really the result of your performance review from 2 years prior, that they are not liquid due to the requirement that employees only trade these securities during short quarterly windows, and that their value is entirely dependent on investors' perceived worth of the company. Recently, Amazon shares have been skyrocketing in value, and as such, employees have been cashing in more income than the company previously predicted. Instead of being happy about this, Amazon has been shrinking the number of RSUs being rewarded to high performing employees during their annual reviews, to the point where the dollar amount (not just # of shares) associated with grants is lower every year after the next, even when employees get promoted. Managers have been very well trained to explain that the company is predicting a higher rate of growth than in previous years and that overall compensation is still expected to rise. Though I have certainly benefited from RSUs vesting at higher target prices over the years, I also realize that this pattern is not sustainable; just like any other company, our stock price is not guaranteed to see double-digit growth every year for the rest of eternity, and something will need to be done to prevent an exodus if share prices begin to drop and employees find themselves with reduced compensation compared to previous years."}, {"review_title": "Okay place to work unless you have an emergency without time left", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Dec 2017", "job_title": "Fulfillment Associate in Logan Township, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent pay with increases for night shift and weekends\r\n4 Day work weeks\r\nEasy Job\r\nEmployee Discount at 10% off first $1000 worth of purchases on items sold by Amazon", "cons": "Mandatory overtime pushes you from 40 hour weeks to 60 hours\r\nHR will fire you if you are negative time off even if its only an hour because of a family emergency"}, {"review_title": "Lack of Trainng", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Dec 2017", "job_title": "Work From Home Customer Service Representative in Tampa, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work from home.

We have a kitchen and kitchenette on each floor.", "cons": "The work itself is not very complex, yet the volume is very high, therefore you always feel stressed out. The better you are at your work, the more you have to do. For instance, if there are colleagues who have a slower pace, thus affecting the team and metrics, the ones who are working faster are given the tasks from the slower ones, just to make sure the team will have good results. This is really unfair to the people who are better at their job because they are not rewarded in any way (it's considered their daily job, and that's it; sometimes the slower ones even get prizes, because they have good results at simpler tasks, an their score in the monthly scorecard is higher). Very unfair.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the promotion process is very difficult. You would think that just being good at your job and handle multiple tasks with good results would be enough, but no. You must have extra projects, even though you are not given time for working on them. You must take time from your personal life. Also, all the project ideas must come from you, not from your manager. So basically the manager is just a critic of what you do, and this is mainly because the managers are not promoted but hired externally, so they have no clue of how the process they run can be improved. This is why they are relying on minions. \r\n\r\nYou would think that promoting from L2 to L3 (the first levels!) should not be very difficult, yet apparently you also need to be constant in your improvements. This means it is not enough to have 1-2 projects with good results, you have to have multiple projects each quarter. However, management forgets there are periods in a year when the work flow increases significantly, and your manager will ask you to focus only on the tasks in hand (no projects at all), and they promise you this is a callout.\r\n\r\nBut, at the end of the year, they simply forget that, you just have to perform at the same level throughout the entire year, no matter what. Again, very frustrating. It is like you are trying to please someone who is always disappointed in you.\r\n\r\nFor example, there was a case when a person did not get promoted because they \"were not constant in their improvements\" (although the results from their job description were great, and they also had projects). The person was disappointed because after so many months their work was in vain. The manager said they should start working for the next promotion cycle, yet the person was discouraged and did not want to do that anymore. The manager said that they are very disappointed in the person's attitude, that they will not help the person with any projects in the future. This is not normal management attitude. They should encourage the person, they should try to help them create a stronger promodoc, provide ideas of improvement.\r\n\r\nAlso, Amazon does not pay enough taking into account the stress level. Again, the complexity is not very high, but the workload is much more than you can handle. The salary here is just above the medium salary, yet it will stay there for years to come. They don't care you have a lot of experience in what you do, they don't care you have more tasks than others, they just pay according to level, and rely on you to get monthly prizes if you want more money (prizes which are given according to monthly scores, and, as explained above, are not at all objective)."}, {"review_title": "If you love a fast paced environment, you will love Amazon!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Senior HRA in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazon provides so many opportunities for growth and development.

You will also get exposure to many cutting edge industry problems that give you very marketable, appealing skills as a software engineer. When moving from Amazon to other tech companies, I was surprised at how highly regarded my experience at Amazon was, and how useful what I learned there has become at later stages in my career.\r\n\r\nThe company overall is very analytical about everything it does- absolutely everything is measured, and decisions are made based on data, not feelings or politics. All projects and individual performance are evaluated against the same set of technical and leadership corporate values. Everyone is held accountable all the time for the measured quality of their work, which forces yearly evaluation and rewards to be quite fair.\r\n\r\nThe workplace environment overall is good- management is very aggressive about enforcing standards of good conduct amongst employees, and the engineering community is very vibrant and collaborative. It has the feel of a startup in many ways, even though it is a multi-thousand person company. The developer community in particular is great- the density of smart people is very high, and there are more opportunities than a single person could take advantage of to broaden their tech knowledge and skills.\r\n\r\nThe benefits and compensation are also generous.", "cons": "Amazon has the feel of a startup in negative ways too- many people have described it as controlled chaos. Because the corporate structure is very flat, orgs tend not to know much about what others are doing, which leads to lots of reproduced work, and unnecessarily reinvented wheels. Interdependencies between teams aren't effectively managed, which leads to groups adding large amounts of work to other groups' schedules, multi-group projects having difficulty getting the resources they need to succeed, and groups with downstream dependencies not properly serving the needs of their clients (I once got an email from a developer tools team saying there were deprecating a key component of my sev1-level system, because they didn't think anyone was using the component anymore).\r\n\r\nIn the technical community, there is a tendency to reinvent the wheel, when perhaps it is not needed. Amazon uses almost entirely homebuilt tools. For some technical areas, Amazon does have very specialized needs that justify this (deployment and build systems for example), but in others (java server frameworks), it doesn't. Rebuilding the wheel leads to lots of wheel maintenance work, and prevents Amazon from reusing solutions to already solved problems, thus saving development time for more important problems.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is the famous pager. It's not fun to wake up at 3am or tell grandma you have to leave thanksgiving dinner because they product detail page in japan is taking 3 seconds to load. In theory pager rotations should be in groups of 6-8, but in practice the one sucker who bothers to learn how to fix the really icky system components (me) gets called constantly even if they aren't officially oncall, and often rotations are much smaller- 3-4 people. Being forced to be 20 minutes from a computer for 25-33% of your life gets demoralizing (unless you are trying to avoid your life, in which case it is convenient).\r\n\r\nAlso, Amazon is very cheap- there really is no such thing as a free lunch. I have had to pay my way on every single group \"morale\" lunch I ever attended.

The sheer scale of Amazon makes software development rewarding: millions of people will use your code (or find your bugs). The code you write can have a significant impact on both people and profits. You will also get exposure to many cutting edge industry problems that give you very marketable, appealing skills as a software engineer. When moving from Amazon to other tech companies, I was surprised at how highly regarded my experience at Amazon was, and how useful what I learned there has become at later stages in my career.\r\n\r\nThe company overall is very analytical about everything it does- absolutely everything is measured, and decisions are made based on data, not feelings or politics. All projects and individual performance are evaluated against the same set of technical and leadership corporate values. Everyone is held accountable all the time for the measured quality of their work, which forces yearly evaluation and rewards to be quite fair.\r\n\r\nThe workplace environment overall is good- management is very aggressive about enforcing standards of good conduct amongst employees, and the engineering community is very vibrant and collaborative. It has the feel of a startup in many ways, even though it is a multi-thousand person company. The developer community in particular is great- the density of smart people is very high, and there are more opportunities than a single person could take advantage of to broaden their tech knowledge and skills.\r\n\r\nThe benefits and compensation are also generous.", "cons": "Amazon has the feel of a startup in negative ways too- many people have described it as controlled chaos. Because the corporate structure is very flat, orgs tend not to know much about what others are doing, which leads to lots of reproduced work, and unnecessarily reinvented wheels. Interdependencies between teams aren't effectively managed, which leads to groups adding large amounts of work to other groups' schedules, multi-group projects having difficulty getting the resources they need to succeed, and groups with downstream dependencies not properly serving the needs of their clients (I once got an email from a developer tools team saying there were deprecating a key component of my sev1-level system, because they didn't think anyone was using the component anymore).\r\n\r\nIn the technical community, there is a tendency to reinvent the wheel, when perhaps it is not needed. Amazon uses almost entirely homebuilt tools. For some technical areas, Amazon does have very specialized needs that justify this (deployment and build systems for example), but in others (java server frameworks), it doesn't. Rebuilding the wheel leads to lots of wheel maintenance work, and prevents Amazon from reusing solutions to already solved problems, thus saving development time for more important problems.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is the famous pager. It's not fun to wake up at 3am or tell grandma you have to leave thanksgiving dinner because they product detail page in japan is taking 3 seconds to load. In theory pager rotations should be in groups of 6-8, but in practice the one sucker who bothers to learn how to fix the really icky system components (me) gets called constantly even if they aren't officially oncall, and often rotations are much smaller- 3-4 people. Being forced to be 20 minutes from a computer for 25-33% of your life gets demoralizing (unless you are trying to avoid your life, in which case it is convenient).\r\n\r\nAlso, Amazon is very cheap- there really is no such thing as a free lunch. I have had to pay my way on every single group \"morale\" lunch I ever attended. And because I am not an XL-sized person, I have had to request custom desks (take forever to deliver and are so freshly cut you have to file down the arm edge yourself), and purchased my own office chair."}, {"review_title": "Join if you need some experience, but stay away if you are looking for a promotion.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Sept 2008", "job_title": "Financial Analyst in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Since the company is growing, there are a lot of opportunities to dig in and make a difference.

I've spent more than 4 years at the company - with a short break in the middle.  So many learning opportunities in this company and opportunities to make a difference at all levels.  Despite being a larger company there is plenty of chance to be impactful whether you're in the field, in engineering, or sales and marketing roles.  The rate of change in the business has been exponential over these past years and being part of that growth has been eye opening.  The company tends to be pretty flat and really live its leadership principles.  It's a very common theme for people to think they're just put up on a wall for people to read - but they're not - they really are interwoven into everything that people do.  The customer obsession vs. competitor obsession is refreshing to someone like me who has spent a bunch of time in the tech industry.  A generally humble company which is always looking to improve and do the right thing for customers.  Also like the fact that nothing is beneath people in the company - a stark difference to other companies where \"execs\" are considered unapproachable and aloof.  Most approachable group of senior execs I have ever encountered.  When I left AWS I missed it intensely and was pleased to return.

Amazon isn't a company that coddles its employees though...so if you want the chef prepared free food, and massages at your desk, then this isn't the place for you.  It's also not particularly structured for career development.  Both of these things aren't particularly important to me - I roll my eyes a little at the over-the-top perks I see in the valley and the approach to career development here completely suits me - but it requires you to be comfortable being a self-starter and to deal with ambiguity.

It turns out to be a SDE2 (you will find people 1 year out of college at that level)\r\n2) Onboarding:\r\n * Pretty much not existent\r\n * I identified a team before joining. I was put on a different team on Day 1, and I found out on Day 1... I should have quit right there...\r\n * It is common to be 'loaned' (you don't have a say on this). They will send you to another team for some months. Then you come back maybe. Play it right or it might impact your career in a negative way.\r\n3) Compensation\r\n * They will get you for the lowest salary possible if you don't negotiate properly (go take a class)\r\n * The RSUs slow vesting (only 5% after 1 year) is horrible. The worst in the industry. They are desperate to keep people around longer and it's not even working (more on the turnover later).\r\n * Salary compression is fast. You will find out about new hires making more than you quite rapidly. On the other hand, you might be making more than someone senior to you (if that helps).\r\n * Salary increases are ridiculously low. Even if you exceed expectation you will get something lower than the inflation rate\r\n * You might get a raise by threatening to leave or showing up with another offer in your hands (be careful with both tactics).\r\n * Seriously, you will get a better salary at an established startup. If Amazon is within the top 5 tech companies then it is the most frugal for sure.\r\n4) Workforce\r\n * Half of the workforce are SDE1s out of college -> they don't know what they are doing. Almost the other half are SDE2s recently promoted -> they think they know what they are doing and they don't. SDE3s are rare and it's almost impossible to get there. I've never worked in the same org with a Principal, it's like a unicorn.\r\n * Turnover is too damn high! I've witnessed many people quitting within 6 months. Knowledge is lost in the process. No, there is no documentation. Of course the best people are the ones who leave...\r\n * You will find more stubborn people, very opinionated, and with a stronger ego than in other companies. \"Disagree and Commit\" is the worst tenet I've ever heard of and it is responsible for a stressful and inefficient workplace.\r\n5) Systems\r\n * Bad legacy systems everywhere. Awful spaghetti code everywhere. Half of your time you will be fighting fires. \r\n * Lots of proprietary stuff -> you'll master plenty of 'not transferable' skills -> your new skills will be useless on your next job\r\n * You will be stuck in a hybrid mix of legacy networks, AWS, and something in between that is the surrogate of a transition program that will last till 2020+\r\n * Teams are not aware of who is doing what. Lots of duplicate work. Waste of time.\r\n * Build system, dependency management, and deployment systems are non sense. They will try to convince you otherwise. Keep an eye on this because once they do you'll know that you stopped thinking with your own head. After 2 years I still don't know how to add a java dependency to a project or what this thing called ION is... Luckily they migrated to git.\r\n * It's a management company. Managers will get promoted, SDEs won't. Getting to SDE3 is like making it to the top of the Everest. Thinking about making the move to management? At Amazon, think twice.\r\n * There is not much learning going on. You might not want to learn the 'Amazon way' of doing things anyway. If you want to learn something read a book.\r\n* Too. Many. Meetings. & Too. Much. Writing. & Too. Many. Strict. Deadlines.\r\n7) Other\r\n * Perks? Bad compared to the rest of the industry. Lowlights: 401k matching takes 3 years to vest.\r\n * You will hate your pager like you'll never hate anything else in your life. You will get paged because of other people hacks. You will not be given the time to fix those hacks. You will get paged again for the same thing. I've seen people getting 30 Sev2/week easily. \r\n * Seattle is full of engineers. Strangers will have fun guessing if you work for Amazon or Microsoft (they will still guess the latter first). The 'Seattle freeze' is a thing, google it. Also, it's getting very expensive quickly. \r\n * You'll move office/building 3 times/year on average. You'll go through a reorg/year.

Most of the people you work with, especially the teams you support, are extremely smart and fun people. Amazon is a well-known and a (mostly) sought-after employer. You help build teams that build products that impact tens or hundreds of millions of people and often make the news. They are slowly but steadily improving the benefits to their employees - more supportive parental leave policies, more liberal internal transfer policies, better offices/buildings. They also generally pay well against the overall market. They are a challenging place to recruiter as well; while that can be less than fun at times, it means you will become a better recruiter quickly. I'm pretty confident that someone who can successfully work at Amazon for a year or two can go on to  be successful at pretty much any other company.

They have unrealistic expectations on their recruiters that add unnecessary.\r\n\r\nEveryone who works there is very serious about their job and has strong opinions. Most are good at listening to other people and making decisions based on data, but you need to be able to take critique and work with other people. People will push back on your ideas.\r\n\r\nWhile Amazon is pretty competitive in the area of compensation/perks, I don't feel it is very competitive for it's level of company. By that, I mean if you compare them to the overall tech market, they are very competitive. However, the people who are considering Amazon are typically also looking at places like Facebook, Google, and Uber. The compensation/perks at those places are a definite step up from what Amazon offers, so even if you enjoy working at Amazon, it makes it difficult to stay there when you hear you can get a significant raise, work on equally awesome projects, and get all your meals free at a competitor."}, {"review_title": "Well, so far it's been alright.

If you don't meet this over some time, your job is at risk. Understandable. It all started when we had a contest to see who could pack the most items within an hour. Upper management saw the numbers and it became an almost everyday thing. I saw it for what it was, a way to get us to pack even faster and the \"prizes\" weren't even worth the extra effort. For all the extra work we did, an extra one or two dollars an hour would've been great.\r\n\r\n- Since our department was the fastest and most efficient, sometimes we had little to no work for us. Instead of sending us home, they would send us to other departments. \"They can't afford to send us home, but they also can't afford to keep us here\" is what many of us would say.\r\n\r\n- Promotions are not based on merit: This was a hard lesson to learn for me as a day one employee seeing others advance and they came in a year later!

Amazon is a great place for builders and if you enjoy building things (robots at home, software at work, the works...) - then you will love working here.\r\n\r\nAs you will hear a lot of Amazonian's say \"there is scale and then there is Amazon scale\". I do not know of any other place that provides the cusp of physical scale and computing scale that Amazon provides. Physically moving goods across the world based on some person clicking a buy now button on the website - and doing it a very large number of times very day - brings with it some very interesting (including several unsolved) problems. it is a lot of fun to work on such problems. \r\n\r\nAmazon is also a place that rewards diversity of thinking and approach. That has brought together a whole bunch of very interesting and smart people. I learn a lot every day that I show up at work. Amazon also has one of the most flexible internal move policies - so it is super easy to find something within the company that you are interested in working on and start working on it!\r\n\r\nIt is a very fast paced environment where something is happening all the time.

You can certainly work at Amazon while having a family to care for, but you need to have some flexibility and understand that some days will be unusually demanding.\r\n- Sometimes folks get too caught up in the process instead of the product.\r\n- Since it's scaling enormously, room for politicking has increased.

It's a very pragmatic, rational approach to getting great work done, and I find that this resonates well with how I am wired.  People expect that you will provide feedback regularly on how they can better embody Amazon's 14 Leadership Principles, and also expect that you can handle feedback in a mature manner.

Amazon is not a belief-driven company; it is very pragmatic. If you have a belief in an idea, you will likely get the opportunity to pilot it, but if you can't deliver data, quickly, to show that it works, the company isn't likely to stick with it for a long period of time.

The products are so unorganized and randomly stuffed into containers. You would think they would have things organized by product in such a large warehouse and on the first day I tried to make the containers I was working in more organized and easy for the pickers to grab product, but by day two I understood why everything was crammed. All they care about is productivity and you have less then 30 seconds to find a spot for an item even if it is bigger than a shoebox and there is literally no room for it any overstuffed crammed container, therefore the stowers are forced to cram it anywhere they can with no care for preserving the products. Of the six \"problem solvers\" I dealt with in training the first two days, maybe two of them were actually helpful and friendly. The rest were rude and arrogant and treated us like we were idiots if we had questions the first day ever working.

I will also take the opportunity to say that this feedback is purely my personal opinion and does not represent the company in any way. I am doing this voluntarily because I want to.\r\nI can only tell what I learnt newly and in spite of being in the industry for many years, I felt I have learnt so many things and maybe, for the first time, actually got to see how institutionalized certain things are, though they seem to be not really alien in concepts in other companies as well. To start with, metrics as a way to define, both the problem and the solution. The concept is certainly not new to most companies, but not in the form I have observed and learnt at Amazon. It actually becomes part of your DNA where you habitually do it and not as a top down mandate. \r\nThis takes us to the next logical step where we define goals for yourself and the team. I have not seen where this is not the case. But again, its in the way it is done at Amazon. The way metrics are used to define these probably make a world of difference. \r\nNext comes the leadership principles that Amazon has so effectively come to represent. Come to think of it, why would we want to hire anyone who doesn\u2019t already have these imbibed in himself or herself. The focus on strong technical knowledge along with testing a person in terms of their leadership skills during an interview itself makes people proud of themselves. This pride multiplies as we become interviewers ourselves. Again, typical of Amazon, you don\u2019t qualify to become an interviewer yourself because you are now in Amazon. You go through a process called Making Great Hiring Decisions and for every interview, you have some one called a Bar Raiser who will ensure we are setting a relentlessly high standard in hiring. Again, no company will want to make poor hiring decisions, but not many have such a well defined mechanism to ensure so. And again, this ties back to what Jeff Bezos always maintained, \u2018Good intentions don\u2019t always work. Good mechanisms do\u2019.\r\nThe last thing is the quality of people you work with. You work with a lot of intelligent people around you and, the best thing about Amazon is the number of highly tenured employees you get to meet. Nobody is above details and expectedly so. It helps you be on your toes all the time. When people always talk in terms of the leadership principles, it seemed pretty odd to me initially, but, not unsurprisingly, became a habit with me too as these principles really form the foundation of Amazon. \r\nI haven\u2019t talked a lot about the Amazon leadership principles in particular because this is about my experience and not really something that can easily be Googled for.", "cons": "Amazon can be very easily very overwhelming.

There are some very good processes for on boarding a new hire. But, seemed seldom used and people struggle a bit.

After having worked at so many tech companies that are run like dictatorships, it's nice to be somewhere where everyone's input is not only listened to, but encouraged. Amazon has an amazing hiring bar and because of this they expect everyone to be contributing to advancing their product. The high hiring bar also means that you will always work with amazingly smart people. You'll never have to pick up the slack for a team mate who just doesn't get it. Everyone is skilled and driven. Managers work constantly with their team to focus on career goals. You let your manager know where you want to be in 1/3/5 years and a clear path is written up on how to get there.

The effort was there on his part, and I was told that I was allowed to cut myself off at 40 hours, however, I think most people at Amazon are not willing to let their work go like that, myself included. In the end, we did find a way to reduce the workload, but it took some time.  Another con may be that Amazon pays less than comparable positions in the area. However, having worked at places where I dreaded going to work everyday, I would much rather be somewhere that I enjoy working while earning a salary that meets my needs nicely.

Amazon is one of the very few organization that actively encourages non-conformity and also gives you a platform to put forward your viewpoint without the fear of persecution from management. In fact the merits of your idea are explored and, if it's convincing enough, it becomes the operational procedure.\r\n4. The CEO is another great reason. I just love Jeff, he is \"the man\" with \"the vision\". And this organization is only going to grow as long as he is at the helm. He is that rare person who keeps his principles and yet mints profits.\r\n5. Growth opportunities are numerous, for those who are passionate about their job. And the chance to take lateral movements and explore other departments is always available.\r\n6. Amazon is an environmentally conscious organization. Their efforts as an organization to embrace renewable resources and sustainable practices makes me proud to be associated with them.\r\n7. The value system here is unshakable. Everything runs on the leadership principles you will hear about very often and these are diligently applied. There will always be a  few bad apples and Amazon has great systems to catch and remove them before too much damage is done.\r\n8. Employee friendly organization. When you have a personal crisis and need support, you can count on your managers and HR to come through.\r\n\r\nI can go on and on, but I think I pretty much made the point. If you get the opportunity to work for Amazon. TAKE IT, you will not regret it.", "cons": "1. Change management could be better. Sometimes it seem like the leaders have decided to jump into the water with both feet in, to test the depth and the average employee is left to deal with the fallout.

But here are some of things I've seen so far.\r\n\r\n1. Incredible recruiting experience - Throughout my entire time recruiting things were communicated very well, there was no guesswork with what to expect, when to expect it. Amazon was completely transparent about what would be coming, and then HELD TO THEIR WORD. I can't stress enough how refreshing it was to actually experience what I was told was coming. It really felt like my recruiters were working for me, not just Amazon. All my interviewers made it into a conversation, not a stressful barrage of questions. And you could tell that each one was engaged and interested, giving insightful responses and follow ups to the things I would say. \r\n\r\n2.  Relocation was simple. I moved across the country to start my new job, and Amazon hired great vendors to help with the relo and made sure every step of the process was covered. This includes working closely with me when my needs diverged from what their usual plan was, I wasn't ever told something couldn't be done.\r\n\r\n3. Management is collaborative. So many companies talk about flat structures and how you don't really have a boss. It's never true. Amazon does a great job of having minimal hierarchy, but acknowledging where that hierarchy exists and ensuring expectations at every level are laid out. Then leveraging the expected skillsets to work in both directions. My management has already been open about expectations but consistently available to ensure I have what is needed. And thats not just with me as a new joiner, it is visible everywhere around me.\r\n\r\n4. My work hours are flexible. My team is nice. Everyone is intelligent and hardworking. The IT support (really essential when you're onboarding anywhere I think) is very useful and responds to needs quickly.", "cons": "Honestly, my cons are pretty banal. But for the sake of fair comparison here are my thoughts.\r\n\r\n1. It took me a couple days to understand all the internal websites. I didn't feel like there was any great home navigation to find all the other internal endpoints that are needed on a daily basis. Thankfully, though, I had some friends already here who compiled a great startup email to point me in the right direction anyways.\r\n2. Ok, an obvious \"Big tech company comparison\" would point out that at Google they have in building Gyms, free lunch, and zen gardens. And I actually haven't been to Amazon HQ in seattle so I don't know all the amenities there. But ultimately, a job is a job. When I saw those things in the Google office it felt like gilding rather than something that would actually make me happier at work, but that could be different for other people. \r\n3. This is my one real con. Amazon doesn't do yearly bonuses, and gives out RSUs instead, which vest on a 4 year schedule that is heavily weighted to the tail end of that time. So you are always leaving money on the table when you leave. Mind you, having equity at Amazon is a really good thing, so at least right now, seems worth the wait."}, {"review_title": "AWS is Awesome (for me)", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits, good management (at least in my org).

Probably one of the few places I've worked where I can give my opinion freely (backed by data, of course) and be praised for it instead of criticized for not being nice enough / political enough / tactful enough  (I'm a woman).  My org (AWS Platform) is very female/minority friendly, at from my experience.  WFH policy is logical (do it when you need it, don't abuse it, get the job done).

Also, this culture isn't for everyone, and you have to pick your org carefully.  A lot comes down to management - it's a big company.

Due to the high bar of hiring, Amazon tends to hire smartest workforce and that's why i have always had learning opportunities from 360 degrees. There are people who are much junior to you and yet are smart and there are folks above you who you can learn from. Which is unique to all other employers i have had.\r\n\r\n2) As my journey continues with Amazon i started loving the fact that promotions and raises are tightly tied to performance. Promotions are a rigorous process but if you are a good performer then all falls in place for you. Politics does not play in, the processes and mechanisms in place ensure that the deserving folks get to the next level. The icing on the cake in there in no time in role requirement to get to next level. If you can perform at next level, you will get there.\r\n\r\n3) Last and most important reason that i have started appreciating in last couple of years is that the yearly planning process in bottoms up. I most companies the goals are decided up top and then they flow down. Not true here ! At Amazon, each teach team decides its own fates and proposes what great things it will do next year and then that planning process flows upwards. Which gives tech teams autonomy to do stuff which makes it super unique.", "cons": "The first year at Amazon can be difficult sometimes. Mostly with the fact that it has a unique culture of rigor as well as people being brutally honest. If you put together a poor quality doc (no presentations at amazon) for a review, you will be told that in the meeting. If you cant deal with it (which is difficult at start) then you will have issues. The best way to deal with this is to first get a mentor who can help you see through these situations. Next try to imbibe the Amazon leadership principles, they are amazing and if you see things through the lens of these principles then you will understand why people behave in the way they do."}, {"review_title": "Working at Amazon is What You Make It", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Senior Software Development Engineer in Hampton, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* Amazon always focuses on the customer first, and in doing such, you feel connected with the people that use your products.  \r\n* Many of the products we work on are at the forefront of the industry, whether it be cloud services, retail, physical shopping, devices, etc.  \r\n* There's always something new to learn and there is a mixture of all kinds of roles from more scientific and research based to hard core system optimization as well as solving new and interesting business problems, so whatever problems you like to solve, Amazon likely has something in that realm.  \r\n* You are allowed to move between teams pretty much as often as you like.  If you end up with a bad manager or unreasonable work pace, you can work with HR to find something more your speed.\r\n* Amazon compensates employees in stock, and the stock has been doing amazing the past 5 years.  \r\n* Amazon is very flexible with dedicated and long-time employees.  My wife got a job that required us to move across the country, and so I was able to start working from home (after 5 years at Amazon) while flying back to visit the main office in Seattle once a month or so.  \r\n* The company operates as thousands of tiny little start ups.  Each team has it's own set of goals and goes through rapid iterative development cycles, which makes for a fun environment.
