Having incredible high hopes. When i started my manager trusted me to do the work, had onboarding remote due to covid has been hard as you won't hear what people are talking about. Around 160+ and still growing products. I found it difficult to focus and learn due to so many products. Willing to do the work and trusting my colleagues to onboard me in the right way i started to work. Then a new manager came in to collaborate with the other manager and suddenly i felt them watching my every step, negative comments instead of trying to understand or help, micromanage started to come in to the picture and my incredible boss has totally switched into something i don't agree with anymore. People work late night's to keep up with work, people work weekends as well and managers would announce deadlines at 16.00 on a Friday for huge projects that needed to be done by Monday morning meaning everyone had to work on their weekends and no one gets extra paid for that. \r\n\r\nFrom being a great team to work in where i felt trust it has gone down hill. Managers texting in the mornings to check if you are working and what you are doing. Managers went from wanting to teach us to getting mad if we asked for help or showed any insecurity.\r\n\r\nIt has turned so bad that i have cried several times a week, i think about how to improve or what to do non stop. It has taken over my life so much and team members are quitting. I have yet to make up my mind as in the end i actually love what i do and i think Amazon web services is an incredible company and products. I took this job wanting to stay for at least 5 years but now I don't know anymore. I myself feel burned out and i know others in my team feel the same.\r\n\r\nAlso the company is so big so it's pretty much impossible to talk to anyone about how you feel. \r\n\r\nMy tip for anyone thinking about taking this job. The job is super interesting, you will get paid alot but you will work over time alot and it's very stressful, your territories are so big that you will do a job that actually requires 10 employees for, you will feel overwhelmed many times, this is fast paced on another level. You might get burned out. It's definitely an experience either way. You are a small ant here.\r\n\r\nBest of luck for trying.

Big problems - At Amazon, no problem is pushed aside as too hard to solve. In fact, they go after the really hard and insolvable problems and then throw talent, time and resources towards solving them. In my time there, pretty much every team I worked with was solving a \"holy grail\" problem in their field and actually making progress towards it. There is no dearth of interesting projects, teams or ideas to work on.\r\n\r\n2. Structure and thinking - There is a lot of document writing at Amazon, in case you have not heard. While some people do not like that part of the job much, I think the required meetings and documents force every employee to truly think about their job and what they are doing. Producing the write-ups and getting them ready to face up to a room of very detailed scrutiny and questioning forces you to think through every aspect of your business. it is really a very valuable skill that Amazon does a great job of developing.\r\n\r\n3. Ownership - Amazon treats you like an owner - a grown up. You have a job to do and you are empowered to do it. There are checks and balances, of course, but you truly do own your business. You make the assessments, take the risks, justify your decisions and ultimately reap the benefits or learn from your mistakes and move on. There are not many fall-backs and layers to catch you if you are not moving your business forward. Not a lot of finger poitning for failures either, that I saw. In fact, I would say that if you do not act like an owner, you will not be successful at Amazon. You have to embrace the responsibility and run with it.\r\n\r\n4. Smart People - You'll hear this a lot and personally, I think some of the talk is overblown but Amazon does indeed have some very, very smart and talented people working there. I know its a cliche, but I did learn a lot from most people I worked with there - and again, I say, most, not all :-) are just genuinely nice people. I would work again with these people without hesitation. I think the leadership there is especially great - just really smart, experienced people with sharp instincts, great insights and lots of ambition. It was really fun working with the folks I did.", "cons": "1. Structure and documentation - What I said above about structure and documentation, while its great to create clarity and shape your thinking, it can get in the way of actually doing your work. Everybody at Amazon is juggling so much and constantly writing high quality documents can get exhausting. The secret here, as in any job, is to balance the strategic against the operational and prioritize ruthlessly. I cannot say I was always effective at it - but I tried till my last day and now have the benefit of hind sight as well :-)\r\n\r\n2. Culture - I think some people could have a tough time adjusting to the culture - its tough, expectations are high and there is not always a lot of hand holding ( in fact, it would be very rare). I think you have to embrace or at least accept it and focus on the positives. Your team makes a huge difference - so hopefully you're lucky and end up with a great manager and great team mates. If you're looking for free food and onsite massages - you certainly will be disappointed. You can end up overworked and resentful if you are not good at prioritizing your work and your life and making trade-offs.\r\n\r\n3. People/Politics - I started to see a lot of the \"we are the best in the world\" mentality start to show up. I don't believe that everyone that works at Amazon is a genius and seeing that attitude crop up every now and then was annoying. Every company has inside politics and even though Amazon tries really hard to believe there is no politics, there is certainly that to deal with. No more than any other company that I can tell, but it can get frustrating when you're working so hard and so long to get derailed by that kind of thing."}, {"review_title": "Get paid for what you do.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Warehouse Worker in Easton, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wage is good and increases.", "cons": "Arduous work but good pay I guess."}, {"review_title": "It's alright", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Warehouse Associate in Oklahoma City, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay is good, you always know when you're scheduled, and the work is as simplified as possible", "cons": "It's very impersonal, after 9 months I've still never met my \"manager'' or supervisor, just the department supervisor.
