The good parts are that the pay is very competitive with a solid base salary and very nice incentives if you hit your quarterly goals. I also received a very generous signing bonus and will receive a less generous, but still great, year two bonus. \r\n\r\nAWS has a start up vibe to it so things move quickly, which is exciting. You have the ability to implement new best practices and lead change within your sector. This helps get you noterioty which is always a good thing. They are also very big, at least within the sales team, on praising employees for bringing in big deals or whenever a compliment is paid to a specific employee related to their work ethic. \r\n\r\nWork advancement is relatively clear in terms of where you have the ability to go and how long it normally takes you to get there.

Things move very quickly which can create a hectic work environment at times. Best practices are constantly changing and aren't necessarily set in stone which makes getting setttled in your role difficult if not almost impossible. \r\n\r\nWithin the LDR role, you honestly have little to no control on the kind of money you can bring in. Your main objective is to follow up on leads and schedule time for the client to speak to a sales reps. You are goaled on how much that individual client's workload will cost within the Cloud but you have no influence on how much that will be. This makes it difficult to hit quota because of lack of control and high amounts of \"touches\" and \"meetings\" to set up.\r\n\r\nAWS follows suit with Amazon's culture where you have to be very self reliant. Being new and asking a million questions is extremely frowned upon to say the least. People will refer you to a Wiki within Amazon that 85% of the time won't answer your question and honestly would've been quicker and easier for the person you asked to have just told you the answer. This at time and can be stressful and frustrating being a new person. Luckily I started with two other individuals which helped calm me down and let us work together to solve problems. If you are to start alone though I could potentially see that person quitting. \r\n\r\nAs stated above, you have those individuals who will immediately capatilize on your mistake and be absolutely sure to forward it on to your manager or even their own manager.

I define my goals, propose projects, suggest changes to existing projects and choose to meet or exceed expectations. Helicopter bosses are not encouraged but I, as an individual contributor, have to do my part to prove that I can work autonomously.

Amazon is the only company I've worked for that loudly and proudly displays its leadership competencies. In fact, almost everything I do can roll up into a particular leadership competency. Usually our actions are justified and rewarded in accordance with these core values.

You have the opportunity to get a lot of analysis experience here.\r\n\r\nYou will get the opportunity to work with AWS.  A lot.", "cons": "The required skills for the business intelligence roles at Amazon have been, until recently, poorly differentiated. As a result, the skill sets of adjacent roles (e.g. data engineer to business intelligence engineer, business intelligence engineer to data analyst or data scientist) have had a great deal of overlap, which has made it difficult for business-specific roles to know which role to request in order to get someone with a desired skill set.  The lack of distinction between duties of business intelligence roles has meant that managers often hire someone as one data role and expect them to do the work of another role (e.g. business analyst being asked to perform the duties of a data engineer by building and tuning Redshift tables and views).  The resulting mismatch in expectations makes it easier to move laterally if you have been doing the work of another role, but makes it more difficult to get promoted, since your probability of successfully being promoted depends on adequately performing the duties of your role at the level you are in while also performing some of the duties for your role at the next level for the role. \r\n\r\nThe mismatch in expectations is also a factor in attrition, because  it becomes highly possible to do what was asked of you, at a high level, but to not get promoted because of the misalignment between what you were asked to do and what is expected of someone with your title.\r\n\r\nMuch of the misunderstanding is not any manager's fault, but is almost to be expected when your manager fundamentally doesn't understand what you do.  It is customary for Software Development Engineers (SDE) at Amazon to work under more-experienced SDEs who participate in code reviews and can provide mentoring in how to advance as an SDE at Amazon. Business Intelligence Engineers and Analysts more often work directly for business managers or customers who have hired them precisely because they can't perform the function themselves at the level need to operate their corner of the business. As a result, an SDE may have the opportunity to work for someone who is better than she is at estimating how long a piece of code will take to write, whereas a business intelligence professional might work for someone who doesn't even know what language they program in or how long it takes to produce a simple snippet of code in it. It is not in the business manager's role description to have to learn how the business intelligence engineer does her job-- only to be able to gauge how \"accurate\" the results are-- but it means that business intelligence roles have to drive their careers and proactively find their community to get better at their job here. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is something of which you should be aware before you come here.\r\n\r\nAnother disappointing reality of being a business intelligence person at Amazon is that you are largely expected to be a data vending machine-- the product managers or executives need data for decision making and come to you in a panic to produce some data under a deadline that gives them scant time to give you the context you need to understand the request. You are often placed in a situation where you have to cajole the context out of them in a series of curt or cursory email exchanges only to have them take what you have produced and make decisions based on it in a meeting that you are not allowed to attend.  From time to time you meet with a requester who is willing to work collaboratively with you so you both gain something from the exchange, but any person can revert back to a vending machine customer based on the deadlines he or she is facing. The result is that the data professional often can't gain a complete view of what makes the business side so special unless switches to working on the business side either entirely or temporarily. Making such a switch can be beneficial if you aren't sure what you want to do, but frustrating if you already know you want to be a data professional.\r\n\r\nI mentioned that the poor role definition often contributed to attrition, and with attrition comes inherited code-- which is one of the worst parts of being a data professional at Amazon.  Most of the time when you start on a team you inherit someone else's Frankensteined code-- pasted together from working snippets that have been handed down over generations of people who have inhabited your role. The output of this code has invariably been incorporated into some essential business function or weekly meeting,  so if you choose to stay in the role despite the mismatch in what you have been asked to do and what is in the description for your role, you will need to find in between your regular duties to seamlessly fix the code you inherited and replace it with more efficient code without disrupting the processes that depend upon it.\r\n\r\nIf you have the patience to deal with these problems, at the end of it you will be seasoned, but it is worth setting goals ahead of time as to what you would like to learn so that you can determine when you have had enough, because you are going to lose a level or two in the exchange. Amazon sets your incoming job level based on the assumption that a data role is harder here than a similar role at a smaller company. They are largely correct, but the added difficulty of your role at Amazon is often not due to complexity that is constructive to growth should you leave Amazon, but due to the yoke of proprietary systems that were built to accommodate operational scale, but are useless at a smaller company. Levels largely don't matter, but if you come in at too low a level, you might get stuck doing data vending machine work when you are capable of doing more, even though you can't prove you are ready to do more complex analyses if all you do is vending machine work. It is a bit of a Catch 22: if you slot someone in a role that lower than their skill level, they are precluded from the opportunity to demonstrate they can perform at a higher level."}, {"review_title": "Brand Specialist", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Brand Specialist in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "At Amazon you work with really talented people that will help excel your development and open new doors in the future.

Tenured employees are not appreciated and employees in general are entirely disposable. I have never worked with so many people that will happily stab each other in the back (or front) to get ahead. There is no fostering of team spirit or taking a genuine interest in people. No-one seems to have any life outside of work or take any interest in each other as individuals.

I also find it hilarious that one of Amazon's 'peculiar ways' (of which there are many), is too not come across like the corporate borg. This place is more like the corporate borg than anywhere I have worked. Regimented leadership principles that you have to adhere to. Don't let wearing casual clothes to work fool you that you'll be playing table football in your lunch hour. 1. You wont get a lunch hour because the business is too frugal (tight) to hire enough staff. 2. There is nowhere to eat your lunch other than your desk, because the deli handling nine floors of employees is tiny. 3. Should you be able to get out for lunch, you have the delights of Slough high street to contend with. \r\n\r\nI think the thing that is most depressing, is that the business is doing extremely well in these uncertain times, and yet there is no celebration of this, no lightheartedness, no fun. Just a relentless drive for growth with people under ridiculous amounts of pressure, trampling over each other to get ahead and sticking to cliques in order to survive. It's depressing that people have to act in such a selfish manner to succeed, and depressing to think that you have to abandon your principles to stay afloat..\r\n\r\nIt is easy to get sucked into the business and try and meet the ridiculous expectations and pressure you will be placed under, but the business can suck you dry if you let it, and spit you out without a thought.

For people coming out of school as Area Managers, the salary is high for a first job. For professionals coming from another company/field they tac on a robust signing bonus that gets baked into your salary for the first two years. Stock options vest after two years. 4 day work week in most cases with 3 days off in a row.  Benefits are good and on par with any good company. A lot of opportunities for growth (not necessarily as a leader but in position and pay) if you play the game.  If you are willing to relocate (which they will pay for) and you are well-liked, you will get promoted simply because there is that much need because of the company's growth.", "cons": "First I'll say that there is not a strong company culture so the experience can vary greatly depending on the Senior leadership team of each site. My experience is from OAK4 which is literally the worst FC in the company to work (based on employee surveys).  Firstly, job specific training was virtually non-existent.  The first week of training is geared at showing you each part of the operations from the associate's perspective.  You will spend time actually doing each of the repetitive tasks that associates do every day.  The second week is leadership training but not for your specific role. They just go over things like how to log on to VPN, company videos and where to find certain resources.  After that the experience can vary. I showed up to my site with no welcome and told to follow certain people for extended periods of time.  There was no circling back or review of learnings, it was literally follow this person and pick up what you can.  There was not a big investment made. Many said it's because turnover is so high, but I would argue the reverse; that turnover is so high because of the lack of investment. While the pay is good, the 2-year bonus is there so that you have to aggressively try to move up. There really isn't a place for someone that doesn't want to get promoted. So keep it to yourself if that is your reality. Trust very few people, and work to parlay it into a better opportunity within the first two years would be my advise. After two years when the bonus runs out it won't be worth it. Get your first vest and be ready to move on.  The 4 day schedule can change quickly and fairly often with little notice. Some sites rotate it regularly on a schedule, and some just change it based on needs.  Most sites do front half (Sun-Wed) and back half (Wed-Sat) days and nights.  A lot of people don't like nights and most don't like back half, but with both of those the crazy goes away a bit as a consolation prize. The 4 day thing can temporarily go away at the drop of a dime. If business needs says that there needs to be a 5th day, Senior leadership will make the call.  The lead time on this could be as little as a day and it could go on for weeks at a time. Same with longer shifts. Associates work 10 hours, so as a leader expect an 11-12 hour norm due to pre-shift and post-shift meetings. When the associates get put on mandatory 12 hour shifts naturally it extends the leaders to 13-14 hours. This can be mitigated but not avoided.  Even if you work very efficiently you will fall in this range. If you don't, it'll be even longer.  There is not much true leadership development.  Development often is learning new things and becoming more of an expert about the operations. However, not much in the realm of real leadership development that will be transferable and helpful in your career after Amazon. Obviously this depends a lot on your supervisor, but it's not made important, and therefore difficult to do even if the desire is there, due to competing demands.  You will have to manage much more than you lead.  There is extreme micro-managing and constant bullying.  Managers get things done out of fear of consequences not of a true belief that what they are doing is the right thing. The amount of unnecessary email communication is frankly ridiculous.  You will end up deleting over a thousand emails a day (no exaggeration).  The important stuff is mixed in there so get control of that quickly through rules and email organization.  While it is possible to avoid, the overwhelming volume often encourages people to log on often from home and get the emails sent to their phone.  It's a personal choice.  Very low integrity in terms of reporting. 80% of the people pencil-whip 80% of the reports.  Trying to do it the right way will extend your hours and add a lot of pressure.  From an HR perspective it's tough as well.  Not a strong HR culture and I found that most of the people were just overmatched in terms of what they were asked to do. It's pretty scary the things that went on from inappropriate relationships to flat out lies and integrity issues. This was the scariest part of my experience as I felt that it could all come crumbling down."}, {"review_title": "Churn and Burn", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Area Manager (LVL V) in Carteret, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Benefits and great pay.", "cons": "When operating at the scale that you'd expect from a massive entity such as Amazon it becomes apparent that numbers matter more than personnel.
