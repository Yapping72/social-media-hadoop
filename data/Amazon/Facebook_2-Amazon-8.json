Here are the pros so far:\n- I have learned a lot of new things that actually matter\n- I am finally having life, working 9-5 M-F and not even thinking about the work after I close the laptop.\n- We get access to paid coursera content for free where we can take any courses we want. I took some personal development and finance courses (it is not relevant to my role in any way).\n- I get to go to a few conferences a year, fully paid by my team.\n- We don't have to get involved with development if we don't want to. I have AS II teammates who never even bothered to learn how development and putting code into production even works.\n- We get to solve very real problems that can have very real immediate impact. You can see in reality how much your work is improving the system or how much it can lower the costs of operations etc.\n- Office policy is so flexible that some people have never ever seen their desks.\n- Dog friendly offices! Bring your dog every day!", "cons": "Of course there are some issues as well:\n- No food other than bananas in select offices and coffees/teas.\n- Onboarding training includes way too many content and takes a lot of time.\n- It feels a bit hard working across the teams to solve an issue owned by another team that affects the results. Even if the solution is simple, it can be really challenging to convince the other team to allow you to fix it.\n- The writing culture here can be considered good by some, but is extremely annoying. I have written maybe 20 conference/journal papers before, but it feels like we have to write down in a document everything, way too much, spending most of our time writing rather than doing.\n- Publishing is very encouraged, but I've heard getting the actual permission to publish is a bit tricky.\n- Vesting schedule is really bad. Along with very average benefits and zero 401 contribution from Amazon unless if you stay for over 3 years.\n- Collaboration can be hard when nobody ever comes to the office.

I was genuinely put in one of the most toxic work environments I have ever known or experienced. I was warned before I came that it would be challenging, but no one mentioned that It would be ridiculously toxic and that I would be hazed by an entire 40+ people. From my understanding, I was put on the team to replace the current manager who already has a lengthy HR investigation against them. So, I started at this new site and I had a counterpart that was already having some HR issues. \ufffc\nFrom the start, it was toxic. I recognized several safety policies being broken by my counterpart and the team. Every single time I escalated or tried to correct them, I was told it was no big deal and to let it go. So, I kept letting it go, although I was fully aware of the actual policies. \ufffc Things began to come to a head when \ufffcmy counterpart demeaned me and yelled at \ufffcme over the radio in front of my entire team, for \u201cdoing too much.\u201d \ufffc Then, when I escalated to higher up because of the disrespect, I was not advocated for at all. In fact, I was told that I should take the abuse from her on the radio and then later attempt to have a face-to-face conversation with my equivalent, despite her lengthy record of disrespect and the fact that I\u2019d only been there two weeks (oh and also managing her is actually NOT in my job description at all).\nOnce I realized that I wasn\u2019t safe at work, that everyone hated me and that I would not be advocated for when I was mistreated, I started having severe panic attacks. In fact, if any of you have been questioning my mental health lately, you now know what I\u2019ve been dealing with. \nAnyways, I had no choice but to take matters into my own hands. So, I spoke to HR myself. Unfortunately, my counterpart keeps eyes on me at all times by accessing the camera system at our site,\ufffc So She was fully aware at the actions I had taken to protect myself. Next, she called together the entire team and actually advised them to not acknowledge me, sit by me or talk to me at all.\ufffc In fact, I noticed the treatment from the team before I realized that they were actually instructed to treat me this way. It even got to the point where if I answered a radio call out, someone would respond \u201cno, I don\u2019t want you.\u201d \ufffcAnyways, a couple of The AA\u2019s On my team actually did come forward today to admit that they were all told to treat me that way by their direct manager.\nAt this point, my mental health had been slipping drastically. I\u2019ve never once had a job where I struggled so hard to just walk in. I have never had a job give me such severe panic attacks.\ufffc\nI was at my wits end, I reached out again to my boss and the HR person because I knew that I honestly could not handle being put in environment that fostered gang mentality and influenced people to be cruel to me 40 hours a week. So I reached out, I begged them and pleaded with them to send me to a different site. Instead of being understanding and empathetic about my mental health and the very toxic situation They put me in, they were basically annoyed. They really didn\u2019t have alternatives for me and they were so rude to me while I was desperately begging for help in their office.\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc \nDespite working at Amazon for years, being a manager and not having any issues like this at prior sites, Amazon did not advocate for me. \ufffc\ufffc"}, {"review_title": "Good Money for Software Engineers", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Team: Prime Video \r\nComparison: I worked in consultancies in London prior\r\n- great total compensation package\r\n- Teams have a lot of freedom to self organize and choose their practices: more/less pair programming, more/less meetings, more/less TDD etc.\r\n- All the engineers are pretty smart\r\n- Good coding practices", "cons": "- diversity is lacking, there are no women in ours or nearest 2 teams (~15 people)\r\n- no salary transparency when interviewing.
