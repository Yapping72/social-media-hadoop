Job description is misleading which explains the high turnover rate and mass hire that is still ongoing since the start of the department in SIN. Work done here does not feel meaningful and impactful at all as it could've been easily covered by the other teams through restructuring. The management does not (and will not) care about the duration of your stay - headcount is simply replaced through new hires daily that are clueless and farewells are like bread and butter in this team. \r\n\r\nBias and favouritism from team leads/managers are so prevalent that they are not even discreet about it. Career progression is not judged by the hard work you've done but rather on the hands of management which are all highly uncoordinated and probably not even sure of the groundworks done by the \"specialists\". This breeds a cult-like and toxic environment as everyone struggles to get themselves on the good books of the managers in order to advance in the position. Hardworking individuals are all leaving one by one as the working environment is so depressing and there's practically zero opportunity to progress if you do not butter up to anyone. \r\n\r\nFeedback system is in practice for the sake of it - mostly patronised and no feasible action done no matter how many times it was highlighted. Unnecessary meetings called for on a daily basis that discuss meaningless topics. Be ready for top-down management style and micromanaged while in this team. \r\n\r\nI feel the company itself is a great place to work at, just not in AHS. If a call centre job is what you're looking for, would still suggest you to look elsewhere with better management that actually cares for your well-being and career interest, do not get enticed by the company brand name.

Seems like some operational job functions are very tough.\r\n\r\nI have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! This is so true. Within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane. The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be.\r\n\r\nPros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. Free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. Downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401K contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. Not so great. Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. They count as part of your 5 personal days per year. Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros.\r\n\r\nWork life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. I have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. If you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but I can't say how many people are working how long. The view on work life balance is a bit skewed. All it comes down to are the managers and what they think. Projects are always never-ending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. Everyone needs a break.\r\n\r\nOn-call really really sucks. Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs double-duty as support operations engineers. Note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. The on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. If the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon. Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse.\r\n\r\nIntegration is the name of the game in Amazon. You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. Whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. I have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive.\r\n\r\nAmazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. If the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday! Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill.\r\n\r\nAs an SDE, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. In most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. Note that Amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. You will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. To me, this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time.\r\n\r\nInternal mobility is a key strength of Amazon, and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect. Internal moves are easy. You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time!\r\n\r\nSeattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area.\r\n\r\nOverall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. The flexibility of this company is really its core strength. You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. Bummer. You shouldn't be slacking!", "cons": "Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.\r\n\r\nBe realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.\r\n\r\nMedical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.\r\n\r\nSDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.\r\n\r\nEmployee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long."}, {"review_title": "Warehouse associate, full time for over two years", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 May 2017", "job_title": "Tier I Warehouse Associate in Carlisle, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great starting pay and the ability to get raises very quickly.

I would tell them \"just think of it as you are getting paid to workout!\" Because they have a vending machine with gear in case you lose yours, people tend to abuse this and not keep tracked of their equipment. Parking lot would get littered with gloves and vests. If you were a fast and efficient worker they would move you around to pick up the slack of the slower employees. Some of these people were barely working making it frustrating for the people like myself who were scanning 3x the packages they were for the same pay. Management or the leaders they had on the floor were mostly young and were not trained to be leaders or have a proper work etiquette. We all have name tags and one of these young punks kept saying \"hey you, yeah you\" to me on several occasions when I advised him my name is on the tag and to address me properly and respectfully or don't address me at all. He no longer called on me from that time on, nor did he apologies. I was a warehouse manager for 8 years before working in IT and never treated my workers like they were cattle. Another big problem is some of these people were not even competent enough to scan the freight onto the pallet. Normally first box gets scanned to the pallet it goes to and after that you can scan freight to the box already on the pallet. This process was challenging for some and if you are working with this person then you usually get pulled aside with them even though you weren't at fault. I would now have not only scan my freight but rescan their freight in. I tried to explain this to leadership and advise who was the problem but, they rather pull a whole group aside instead of the the individual making the mistake. Bottom line when you scan something in right, it has a different tone beep and goes green showing it was scanned successfully and it does the opposite if you don't scan it in properly.

We have high standards on hiring external talents, but will promote anyone internally to the same position (AMs) with no experience. Too many internal politics inside the FC.

Most managers are L5 and everybody want\u2019s to be an L6 yet lack experience to do the role.

All tasks were timed. 1-2 minute breaks in-between tasks (bathroom, getting water) were not actually able to be taken if daily goal was to be reached (you could physically take the break but the task clock would be running).

Goals for productivity and sales would change with little notice. Many members of the team were put on coaching plans to improve how fast they could work, or fired for not being fast enough. The more like a computer you were, the better. - Went from flexible hourly schedule to schedule-bidding based on stack-ranking. Teammates who were needing supplementary income (due to our low pay) had to leave part-time evening jobs and work odd shift times, or quit. - No internal growth opportunities after 3+ years on the team. Limited growth opportunities to move to other teams in different job functions (team was ranked as L3 but considered corporate). - Limited yearly raise for top performers, no raise for cost of living adjustment. Essentially, a pay-cut in the final years due to rising inflation and cost of living in one of the nation's most expensive cities.

Hours are advertised as flexible but are not and are changed very frequently, sometimes every week with few schedule options to choose from. They are \u201ccustomer eccentric\u201d but do not help CSA\u2019s succeed. Resource pages send you in circles and you have to reach out to a manager nearly every call to get a simple task completed. Then we are judged in our metrics on how many times we reach out to said manager and it can poorly affect you. Training was 100% self led, nothing but reading modules on our own for 6 hours a day for 2 weeks and expected to understand and memorize the material. About a week and a half into your training you\u2019re thrown into taking calls with little assistance and no shadowing with an experienced CSA beforehand. Nearly half of my original training group has been laid off (not sure how, Amazon is coming up on peak season and we were hired specifically for this time) and were only given between a 2 week to 6 day notice. Some had less.

High expectations: Amazon sets high expectations for its employees and demands a great deal of accountability. This can be a challenge for some, especially those who are not comfortable with a high-pressure work environment. Lack of work-life balance: Due to the demands of the job, many Amazon employees report feeling like they have little time for personal pursuits outside of work. Physical demands: Some Amazon jobs, such as those in its fulfillment centers, can be physically demanding and require employees to be on their feet for long periods of time. Pressure to meet performance goals: Amazon sets high performance goals for its employees, and those who do not meet these goals may face consequences, such as demotion or termination.

If you're interested in pursuing non-Amazon technical development or certifications, be prepared to invest personal time and money. The combined effect of these factors has made my experience disappointing. I've reported to seven different managers in my time with the company, which has made it difficult to advance. However, experiences at Amazon vary widely depending on your team and focus, and some teams are better than others. I strongly recommend vetting your manager and team thoroughly before accepting a position. Finally, the scale of Amazon requires teams to focus on a smaller part of the bigger picture, which can result in siloed teams and individuals.

In the first year the facility was open it went thru a little over 4000 employees. Some don't even make it thru the first shift. The place is literally ran like a high school although some days it feels more like kindergarten due the childish behavior of some managers. We have been working an extra day of mandatory overtime since October of 2022 due to a shortage of staff. As soon as one batch is hired another batch leaves. Mandatory overtime is called MET and sometimes it gets added to your schedule at the last minute. If there is bad weather like the ice storm we had a few weeks ago they wont close the facility even though surrounding cities and schools shut down. They said they would excuse peoples time but after the fact refused to do so and, in some cases ask for pictures to prove you could not get out of your neighborhood. Pretty petty childish behavior of them to cheat people out of their time like that. There is a lot of favoritism, bullying and intimidation by the managers. The few good managers we have don't stay long or get moved to another area. In the first year my area went thru about a dozen managers and the longest one stayed was about 5 months. He was a pretty good guy but the constant stress of the place drove him back to the facility he came from in Memphis. Our department just acquired a problem manager that was passed over to us by another department. She has already ran off several good people in our area and about half of our department is now looking for a job or a transfer to another facility. No one in the area wants to pick up shifts on her end of the week and work with her. She has bullied several employees with health issues and put them in dangerous situations. Forcing employees to work in situations that are not ergonomic and could cause injury. Forcing employees to do very physical indirect task that they may not be physically able to do or desire to do and were not hired to do. Don't let her see you talking to someone or she will question you about your conversation. Upper management refuses to get rid of her and just lets it go on. It's really sad because it could be a great place to work. The facility has been open about a year and a half and most of the original employees are long gone. The few of us who remain most likely will not be there much longer at the rate it is going.
