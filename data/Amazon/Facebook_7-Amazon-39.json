You start with 10 hours of unpaid time off you can take whenever and get 20 more hours every quarter until you hit 80 hours. You start with 10 hours of paid time off plus you get 10 hours every 2 months for a total 60 hours a year. You start accruing vacation time the moment you start and accrue 40 hours in your first year. I work overnights and make 16.40/hr. Also, if you need to use unpaid time off, you don't have to call off or anything. You just don't show up and it takes it off automatically. Also they have an app called amazon A to Z where you can view your schedule at the bottom or use one of the tabs to see things like how much time off you have available, your pay stubs, and transfers. You can transfer to a different department as long as you have been a blue badge for 30 days. Blue badge employees don't have a point system like white badge employees. I don't much about the benefits or details of a white badge. You get two 30 minute breaks. One is paid and one is not. 8", "cons": "It's very hard work sometimes and can be hard on the body. It feels like I make 16.40/hr. You will barely be able to walk after your first week. I had to use a personal day just to recover but luckily I started on 12/27 and you have to use your paid time off before the end of the year so I used the 10 hours I started with and got 10 more on the first of January. If I recommend taking ibuprofen every day for the first two weeks. It will help stop the lactic acid from swelling your muscles so much. The turnover rate is high because the work can be very stressful sometimes. You also have a rate but I don't think its enforced too much on the dock. As long as your actually working and not goofing off you should be fine. If you're more than 3 or 4 minutes late it will use a whole hour of unpaid time. There are no increments. So if you're late I would recommend waiting for close to the hour mark to clock in or you won't get paid for it. I work 4 overnight shifts from 615pm to 445am. If you weren't working third shift before this job like I was, this can be a hard adjustment. But i get home around 530am sleep until 3 and leave to go back to work at 530.

If you apply to be a blue badge (easy to do if you have the wherewithal), you can add dental and vision (really good vision) plus some other resources.\r\n3) If you're worried about Covid, have no fear! They make sure people social distance and sanitize their stations often. Plus, on-site testing is available for free. If you test positive, they immediately give you two weeks paid leave from when you get your result back.\r\n4) Free work shoes. Amazon gives each employee $105 voucher with Zappos to buy suitable shoes and/or insoles. That renews at the beginning of the year too.\r\n5) You pretty much get what you expect. Depending on which part of the chain you work in, what you imagine is what you get. I was wary of applying because I'd heard horror stories from the news and a friend of mine who worked at Amazon in Washington that they wouldn't let you use the bathroom or get water during Prime week or some other stupid thing. Yeah, sometimes it's fast-paced, but what do you expect? It's a business. You work.

You get pretty good at it over time, but that's like anything.\r\n5) Leave is annoying and complicated. During 2020, we had to work on Thanksgiving (shorter shift), Christmas Eve (full shift...ugh), and NYE. You have to plan quite a bit to rack up substantial paid leave.\r\n6) This is physical work. You have to move. You have to lift, bend, squat, reach, and briskly walk. Take your age and physical ability into account before you apply.

time. Reason is high attrition not need for employees.\r\nOut of every 100 external hires, 30 quit before 1 year; 80 quit before 2nd year end and only 7% remain till the end of 4th year when the RSUs vest\r\n\r\nSo if you are an outside hire chances are 0.3 that you will have to quit before 1 year denting your CV. Too high a risk\r\n\r\n# 2 -> Be ready to be micromanaged\r\n\r\nJeff Bezos is a infamous micromanager. 90% of managers in Amazon micromanage. You will be told what to do - including fonts in word documents, type of excel to create, what type of comments to provide\r\n\r\n# 3 -> Nobody will care for you\r\n\r\nHR is non-existent in this company. Leadership principles are a big hoax. Only on paper, none followed. Managers interested only in furthering their own careers. No meaningful career discussions possible\r\n\r\n# 4 - > Career levels -> You will be below the ones that joined out of campus or stayed many years in Amazon by a drastic margin\r\n\r\nCareer Levels in Amazon are:\r\nLevel 4: SDE - 1\r\nLevel 5: SDE - 2, TPM, Manager - II, Product Manager\r\nLevel 6: SDE - 3, Sr Engineer, TPM-III, Manager-III, Sr Product Manager\r\nLevel 7: Principal Engineer, Principal TPM, Senior Manager - Software Dev, Senior Manager - Product Management (They will camouflage this in the external market as \"General Manager\" to hoodwink ppl)\r\nLevel 8: Director\r\nLevel 10: VP (There is no level 9)\r\nLevel 11: SVP\r\nLevel 12; Bezos (CEO)\r\n\r\nFor internal campus hires\r\nLevel 4 - usually a SDE stays 2-3 years before making to Level - 5\r\nLevel 5- Level 5 to 6 is tough and can take upto 3-5 years.\r\nlevel 6 to 7 is also 3-5 years\r\n\r\nFor external hires (outsiders)\r\nLevel 4: Folks with less than 4 years work ex OR with salary lower than max band of Level 4 will come here\r\nLevel 5: Folks with salary less than max of Level 5 OR with upto 9-10 years are hired here\r\nLevel 6: Folks with less than 15-16 years are hired here\r\nLevel 7: need 15+\r\n\r\nSo net-net if you are at level 6 outsider - you could be director at Travelocity while a campus hire can be there within 5 years\r\nVERY bad for outsiders\r\n\r\nA director at Yahoo may join at Level 7 and report to a joker with no ppl manager skills 10 years younger to him.\r\n(Associates team in Bangalore is one such team - worst to work for)\r\n\r\n# 5: Pay\r\n\r\nThey design pay with base pay  + sign on\r\nSign-on is for first year and second year - it is a trick to ensure you run on treadmill for 2 years and your salary at beginning of 3rd year can be less than the first year if you are not promoted\r\n\r\n# 6: Recruiters lie\r\nDue to high hiring bar and bar raiser interviews, they reject most that interview. This means recruiters are under tremendous pressure to get candidates in. Some positions are open for 6-12 months and finaly moved back to Seattle. \r\nSo recruiters lie left, right and center to get candidates in.\r\nDon't trust the recruiter\r\n\r\n#7: Lack of social etiquette\r\nIt is Amazon's official line that since ppl are overworked they don't socialize and develop social etiquette. Typical Amazon manager (those who grow from within) are abrasive\r\n\r\nNet-net bad place to join for anyone experienced. Risks outweigh benefits.\r\nInfact unless they offer 3X pay (which they won't), not worth joining Amazon.

Honestly, it's a dice roll if you're going to be happy and successful here. And I wouldn't put the odds in your favor (sorry). Just look at the average job tenure here.\r\n\r\nA lot of your success in your role, like a lot of places, is going to come down to who your manager is and who you work with. That's really what will make or break you.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the notable cons I feel are worth bringing up:\r\n- Seeing one of the folks who interviewed me crying in a 1-1 with her manager\r\n- Poor work/life balance\r\n- The MAWS (i.e. Moving to AWS) software development felt needlessly complex and stressful. It took forever to do anything. And there is often little to no accurate documentation to help you out\r\n- Good documentation writing was neither praised nor highly valued. But rather, your ability do \"Dive Deep\" and sort through sometimes a mess of a project to root cause a problem or implement a feature was praised\r\n- At the end of the day, the only leadership principal that matters here is \"Deliver Results\". If you can do that, then you can reasonably justify the other 13 LPs\r\n- Learn to say no. Be careful of you manager or others higher up trying to use the \"Ownership\" leadership principal to justify giving you more work to do when you're already overworked\r\n- The salary is alright.

But with Covid, I had no other choice. The PAs and AMs know what they are doing despite popular belief (popular belief being what I've read on reddit, salary.com, and glassdoor.com reviews).\r\n\r\nI started off in stow which was the most excruciatingly boring job for someone with a mind for puzzles like myself (I literally choose to major in Mathematics). But like I said, I went to work with a good attitude everyday and tried to put out good numbers. I succeeded. Got noticed by my mangers and kept being told I was the top performer of my floor. My trick was to just make a game out of it and to try to beat my own best. Yes it was exhausting, yes I hated working all night and sleeping all day, yes I wished I got to start in a better department. But in the end, I got paid 1.5x my state's minimum wage for a job anybody can do.\r\n\r\nAbout two months in, I asked for a transfer to the receiving docks and my manager was a little reluctant to lose the top performer but didn't want to hold me back.
