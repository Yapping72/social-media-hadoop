AWS is the leader in cloud computing. Better products, better services, more innovation as a faster pace than our competitors and always keeping the customer #1 (Amazon leadership principle \"Customer Obsession\" is not just a tagline). Joining AWS means joining Amazon, yes. But it also means you benefit from the Amazon stock price if you are awarded RSUs, which most full time employees are. It takes 4 years for RSUs to vest 100%, but time moves fast in this organization. You will work with some of the smartest minds in the industry. Plenty of room for career growth in AWS and Amazon (you can transfer from one to the other).", "cons": "Each department in AWS runs like it's own company. Very much a start-up feel. Not a lot of structure (which can be good and bad). New hires should expect at least 6 to 12 months to be fully ramped (not even kidding). Performance reviews are annual, but you need to be \"making a case\" for yourself all year long as the opinions of your colleagues and peers is taken into consideration. The performance/productivity goals for recruiters (sourcers specifically) is unrealistic. Be ready for high volume recruiting if you're a technical sourcer. It's not enough to meet the bar, you have to raise it to be promoted. This means on top of an unrealistic hiring goals, you also have to take on several side projects. You'll easily work a 60 hour week for the first 2 years if you want to be promoted. As with all jobs, it's all about your manager. Make sure when you interview, you are scheduled to speak with the person you would report to and make sure you ask a lot of questions about their management style. That being said, lateral transfers are common, so if you don't like your manager, it's fairly easy to get transferred to another team.

I have witnessed many many valuable employees let go for what would otherwise be excusable reasons at other companies. Secondly, they have entirely too many supervisors/managers. The old adage \"too many chiefs and not enough Indians\" could not be more relevant. Consequently, the left hand never seems to know what the right one is doing, and thus the sense of disorganization can be remarkably palpable. Although there are some supervisors/managers that are clearly competent with their position, the majority will leave you scratching your head wondering just how in the hell they landed a supervisory/management role. I recently overheard one associate joke that the qualifications for such roles must simply be breathing.  Furthermore, most of the job duties are by nature very redundant and boring, and the perception of time creeps at a snails pace. This is probably not a job that you will  \"enjoy\u201d per se, however, you won\u2019t necessarily hate it either.  Last but not least, the spread of COVID is currently rampant there.
