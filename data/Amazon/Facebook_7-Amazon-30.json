The managers, at least at the fulfillment center I work in (UK-Daventry), are just... ugh, I'm not gonna keep complaining here, but if you want my advice, work somewhere else if you can. Not only the job and pay is bad, but the managers are also bad.\r\n- God dam, is a hard job. I did not think it would be that hard when I joined, but it is. Physically that is. After work all my body hurts and I go to sleep just to wake up, have two hours to eat and shower, and then is back to work. Is a nightmare.\r\n I feel just like a modern day slave.

Too much micromanagement\n2. Too much survelance \n3. You can't really take vacation as you can be fired when you come back for not meeting a deadline by yourself\n4. 11 hrs a day is normal for software engineers on weekdays and a lot of work on weekend along with oncall pager duty almost every night of the oncall week that comes ever 3-4 weeks usually.\n5. If your manager does not like you they can block your internal team transfer.\n6. Amazon practices stack ranking so even if you are an awesome engineer you will be compared to everyone else in your team and eventually fired\n7. Pay is good but not as good as it should be.\n8. People will step on your hands to climb the corporate ladder even if you are just trying to do your job and not really outrun anyone else.\n9. All code review request revisions are averaged out so if you push multiple revisions of each code review request, you will be given hell in annual review.\n10. Once you receive the rating as NI - needs improvement, no matter how much you improve, your life will be hell at Amazon. Based on last years improvement being NI, you will be denied any raise in your upcoming year.\n11. Vesting schedule is substandard, only 5% after first year and 15% after second year which means they already know that you will leave within the first 2 years.\n12. If you leave before finishing 2 years at Amazon, they will not give you their portion of RRSP/401k contribution.\n13. Managers treat you badly in daily standup and other meetings if you are not their favourite.\n14. Their culture is really toxic and your teammates are not willing to, or rather penalized to help you.\n15. Ramp up is a nightmare, as you will be expected to know everything within the first week and the documentation does not help at all.\n16. In order to get promotion, people have created more than the needed number of solutions to do the exact same thing and shamefully defend it saying its different when actually its not.\n17. New grads are treated the worst, with literally no work life balance.\n18. H1B visa is abused by Amazon as people are brought from all over the world and then fired after 6 months, leaving them 2 months to find a new job or to leave the country.\n19. HR is not helpful as they are there to protect the company and 99.99% of the time will take the manager's side.\n20. Some people are just hired to fire so the rest of the team can watch it happen and is scared for their job so they work harder.\n21. Examples of the above point can be found in the communities inside phone tool in amazon where former employees who got fired due to these policies. They have changed there name to (piped) , pip meaning they were put on performance improvement plan which is Amazon's fancy name for managing an employee out.\n22.

I was hired for the holiday season, thinking this could build into a great job-wrong! To start with, they didn't allow breaks when I first began, I know you are entitled to a 15 min. break in a 4 hr shift, so when they wouldn't call a break, I would just sit down on my own for 15 min. The supervisors would seek me out and tell me-\"No, no, no we don't do that there's work to do!\" (So I would hide for 15 min, just to get off me feet for a few.) So coincidently after a few weeks, suddenly management started calling breaks! Long story short, when they need you to work they make it \"mandatory\" to stay late but if you want more hours, they will tell you they don't have anything. After the holiday season, I was told if I wanted to keep my job I had to switch to the overnight shift! I thought I was a 'star' employee, I started training new hires a week after I began working for them! I told management that there was no way I could adjust to the overnight shift, but was told the same, either work the overnight shift or there's the door! I tried it for a few months but I realized that they don't care about you, you are just a number! The 'worker bee's' are the ones that do everything and that lazy people that hide until their shift is over manage to sneak through the cracks! Management will make promises to give you the impression that you have a chance at a long term position with Amazon, however it's not the case. They will just use you to get the job done but that's it. They would even lie to us during the busy season and overnights, to get us to do more they would promise raffles, pizza parties, etc, but it would never happen!!

The managers are often too young and lack life experience. I have worked at two facilities and have been severely abused now at both facilities. The first location harassed me until I cried. When I cried, in front of them, they continued to harass me. There\u2019s no karmic or social justification for anything that has been done to me while employed at Amazon. The harassment continued over and over, encouraging customers who visited the facility to do the same. After speaking with management and HR, I was let go for leaving early and not being on schedule because of the harassment issues I was experiencing.\r\n\r\nI reapplied to another facility. I noticed that my heart grows faint under certain working conditions. After choosing to protect myself and my health by choosing other working conditions, I was followed around by managers/supervisors. When the manager began micromanaging the working conditions, I explained to him my experiences. He was accommodating with sarcasm. He was most focused on my social media posts(which aren\u2019t public and I\u2019ve never invited him too) then addressing the issue. The shifts after having a conversation with this manager, became unsafe and I now have injuries that I never thought were possible (severe squeezing mid spine, pain in my shoulder joint). Keep in mind I have taken personal accountability to watch safety videos and practice those safety precautions daily. Those safety measures become irrelevant when you are being specifically targeted by management who intentionally manipulates the work algorithms to assign tasks that are unsafe working conditions. They will blame my responses to those working conditions instead of the targeted harassment by intentionally giving me repeated tasks that are difficult and unsafe. Amazon doesn\u2019t supervise their managers and the HR is disrespectful when you speak to them over the phone. I\u2019m told to speak with management but they are the issue (The first day I started I was screamed at and accused of something that had nothing to do with me. I resolved the issue on my own by calmly communicating the issue.From this experience I knew to keep to myself and work diligently independently) There is an HR on site but no one seems to know where she is. I keep seeing someone who looks like HR but when I ask, she says she isn\u2019t. Given my experience, it\u2019s possible she is the HR rep and is lying. \r\n\r\nThe culture is immature which breeds a lot of issues. They\u2019ve done a great job at incorporating a belief system that holds you ultimately accountable for their harassment. (If I pursued this further, I would be blamed for HRs poor communication because I didn\u2019t continue to follow up, even thought my experience calling HR usually requires at least 5 phone calls for one minor issues. When I speak with them, every time they have been short tempered, condescending and take actions when . not necessary or don\u2019t take action when necessary. I don\u2019t report each violation of harassment. By attempting to be accountable to my own work conditions by managing myself prior to escalating issues elsewhere, I would be considered as someone who isn\u2019t accurately dealing with the situation, by keeping to myself and changing my working conditions when I see that management is intentionally assigning me tasks that are meant to invoke injury, I\u2019m seen as not taking the right steps even though reporting the issue to HR only makes matters worse and I\u2019ve experienced retaliation before. The culture is such that I\u2019m supposed to believe each situation is unique even though there\u2019s little to suggest anything is different )."}, {"review_title": "If you don't have other choices", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Sortation Associate in Plymouth, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great team and these are all the good things I have to say!", "cons": "They overwork you at the point of feeling burned out.
