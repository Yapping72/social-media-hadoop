They were willing to support me through early mistakes, and develop me into a much stronger engineer through my first years in the industry.\r\n* Internal tools and support are very strong. Access to internal documentation, source code, videos, message boards, and office hours for the dozens of systems I had to learn to interact with made life much easier. With such a large company, many people have experienced similar problems to you before, and it's easy to find answers to problems in the internal search tool\r\n* Lots of opportunities to work on challenging projects, and a relatively straightforward process for internal transfers if you find another team working on interesting projects", "cons": "* I found that the amount of work put on you scales faster than your own productivity does. Early on I felt mildly overwhelmed mostly due to a lack of experience, but even as I learned and began to work much quicker, I was given more projects, required to learn new tools, languages, or software, more project management responsibility, and more responsibility to develop new hires (coming in frequently due to turnover) or organize tech talks or reading groups. \r\n\r\n* By the time I left, I had asked around, and only one person (a manager) was happy with their work-life balance. I worked here for a little under 3 years, and only 2 of maybe 20 original team members were still around by the end. This turnover is both a symptom and cause of burnout as merely by sticking with a team for more than a year, you're likely to become the only person to know intricate details of a few systems, and so become responsible for most of its management on top of whatever other work you're assigned, which then leads to burnout, which leads to turnover, and suddenly now some other poor person is in charge of the system\r\n\r\n* On my team tech debt piled up dramatically. Within two years, we went from owning just one system to more than ten. On call rotations became so hectic that most of the time was spent putting out fires rather than working on addressing root causes. Frequent shifts in team structure, and transitions of ownership of systems also meant constantly having to learn new systems on the fly, and being responsible for decisions made by other teams. However management rarely made time for more than one major project to address operational burden per year, instead prioritizing development of new systems and features, which only further added to issues"}, {"review_title": "Salary", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Have a good culture, helping seniors.", "cons": "Haven't found any cons for now."}, {"review_title": "PIP before RSU vested", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer (SDE) in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free bananas\r\nCEO went to space", "cons": "CEO came back from space\r\nUnregretted attrition quotas (hire to fire)\r\nBackstabbing culture"}, {"review_title": "Worst leadership team and culture I've ever experienced", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 May 2021", "job_title": "Business Analyst II in Shenzhen, Guangdong", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible work hours but sometime could be long.

First, you will be reporting to people who are green in their careers, and pretend to have more experience than you. My last manager was an intern 5 years ago. It is almost laughable to have someone like her manage professionals with 15+ years of experience. But, this is Amazon. They promote from within, which is great, but they lack the ability to align strong professionals with equally strong leadership. The scales are off in this regard. \r\n\r\nSecondly, be prepared to work 16-hour days. Personally, I fell physically sick working those hours, supporting several business groups, which later went to provide 4 full-time jobs to other people. Did you read that? 4 full-time jobs. Why does Amazon do this? Because Amazon is cheap and they have cleverly embedded \"frugality\" into their Leadership Principles, so, as a result, you have everyone perpetuating this terrible cycle of being overworked, understaffed and miserable. \r\n\r\nThe culture in this company is brutal. Colleagues are constantly throwing each other under the bus, and the turnover is high. GSF recruiting managers are self-serving report trolls. They care little for the well being of their team mates, although they check all the boxes, to show that they are being diligent. All they do is ruminate Amazon jargon, and their management style, or lack thereof, is linear and ineffective. Their expectations are off, and they can be unforgiving, when it comes to mistakes. People are placed on PIPs, as quickly as after 6-7 months of starting their new role, even though the role has nothing to do with their experience, in many cases. These are pretexts to walk you out. In fact, if you search online, you will find that FOCUS/PIVOTS are ploys to gather evidence against employees who need additional training. \r\nManagers do NOT like to have to worry about training or re-training. This is a cultural trait. If you're going to be taking up their time, you are gone. Trust me on this! Amazon moves fast, and they will leave you behind, if you do not pick it up quickly, unless you are willing to sacrifice it all for your job. It is unhealthy, and it is cruel. 70% of people who are placed on performance improvement plans are dismissed. Therefore, if you find yourself on a PIVOT, take the severance and run! \r\n\r\nAlso, there is systemic racism in Amazon. Data indicates that Black employees do not get promoted as quickly as their counterparts. This is an issue that has been brought to the executive team\u2019s attention. This goes back to my point of AMZ not being top-notch with their internal recruitment practices. Yes, they can deliver your packages in a drone, but they cannot get the basics right. Why such a miss? Because Amazon is a purely transactional company. It needs individuals who can shut-off their personhood and work. Like I said, it is a brutal environment. \r\n\r\nLastly, another strange thing is how L7s and L8s are treated. It is really weird that they have forums to talk about their lives, their successes, which is all well in good; but this is done in a celebrity-like format. It is weird, and I hate it. If you are in GSF, be ready to never meet or talk to your L7 or L8. You\u2019re too much of a small fry to have them come down and speak to the peasants. Again, the culture is awfully top-heavy. \r\n\r\nIf you think about joining Amazon, look for other groups. Some of them may not be that bad. But, beware of GSF. Strong recruiters go there to be exited from the company. If you do, be prepared to have 300+ requisitions, and report to people with less qualification than yourself. \r\n\r\nOverall, Amazon has been the most disappointing experience of my entire professional career."}, {"review_title": "Best work experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Finance Operations Manager in Ciudad de Mexico", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great teams and Great learning opportunities", "cons": "Long hours every day.

It looks like if most of the people of your team quit the company every 1-2 years that's expected. People get burned out , and try to stay only as much time to get some of the stocks (you only get a little percentage the first year). If you search for people you'll see most quit either after 2 years -when you don't need to return your relocation bonus anymore- or after 4 -when stocks stop vesting. This means that you will get to work with demotivated people who are just waiting their best moment to leave. Amazon doesn't seem to care about any of this and they just keep on replacing people who leave, without taking any action to address the concerns that got people out in the first place.\r\n- This is a highly political company. There's no way that we are \"working backwards from the customer\" if teams are fighting over getting each other's stake. When your team gets into one of these fights and decisions are made without anyone being able to state a good reason for them, it becomes difficult not to get emotionally affected.\r\n- Salary increases do not account even for inflation, leaving you with less money the more time you spend there. Not me neither any of my colleagues got an explanation on what we were doing wrong to get such ridiculous increases, or any other suggestion rather than \"get promoted\". My rent and costs where increasing more than 3% each year and from Amazon I got a 1.3% increase after more than a year and a half.\r\n- This is secondary, but most benefits are just there for the sake of saying \"we have those too\". The dental and other insurances make you pay a monthly quantity and in general add little value over what you would get if you pay them by yourself if you were not in Amazon. \r\n- While I was there, there was a time where I was strongly thinking to go to US due to some personal reasons that made this almost a requirement for me. Amazon wouldn't support me because a few months before they added a rule stating that to relocate somewhere where you need a visa, you need to be an SDE-II and be in that position more than a year. Amazon has become the only company in my career so far that wouldn't help me relocate to a country where they have an office and positions available. This is something that can affect employees' lives a lot and they have introduced this as a vague internal rule without any explanation. But I guess visa sponsorship is expensive, and not worth it if the risk is just losing a replaceable SDE-I resource.\r\n- Don't even get me started on diversity."}, {"review_title": "Fair and great co-workers", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Inspector/Packer in Spokane, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay with no stress.
