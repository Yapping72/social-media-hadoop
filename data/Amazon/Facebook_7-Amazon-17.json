It is not a traditional fulfillment center. We did not pack customer orders. This is just a center that distributes orders to other fulfillment centers. There are two main roles if you are new , stower and picker (they have more, but 9 times of ten you will be placed there of new). When you are trained, you will get put in one of the two areas, you can't do both. I was a picker (outbound) so I can really only talk about that. All I can say about stowers (inbound) is that they get orders from vendors and put them on the shelves. I don't really know anything else. Both roles are PIT (Google \"Amazon PIT\" so you can see what I mean) based. AT our facility PIT machine goes up 40 feet in the air. Yes, you will go up in the air with it and a cage. You have on a harness and during training they try to help you get over that fear. I have a bad fear of heights but for the most part was able to get over it because of the exposure and the aisles being so narrow, it feels a little less risky.\u00a0 Pickers go into aisles and find boxes based on the handledheld instructions. So it will tell you what aisle, row, height and bin(which holds a bunch of boxes).\u00a0 When you get to the bin you scan it and then look for a particular box. Once you find the box, you scan it, put it in the cage attached to your PIT and do it again until your cage is full or the handheld tells you to drop off your cage. You take it to the loading dock (you don't have to empty it... someone else does that... thankfully) and get a empty cage and do it all again. 70% of the time If it tells you your first item is on aisle 170, you will pretty much stay on that aisle and for a bunch of boxes (maybe 30+) so you don't have to spend time trying to get to the next aisle. When you do exit the aisle, a lot of times, the next stop is the aisle that right next to it or close to each other. If you look and see it telling you to drive across the building without a notice saying you are changing zones, you are probably read it wrong. Look again ..To me, finding the aisle was a little tricky sometimes because I didn't go consistently and never remembered where aisles were. The hardest part though is finding a small package in a bin that has a bunch of items in it. You sometimes have to take other heavier boxes out to get to your one box. It's annoying. And sometimes the stowers don't stow right (or pickers don't put the boxes back right) and so the labels aren't easily visible and you have to lift a box just to see a label. I hated that. I was always praying for my box to be at the front. This is especially true for deep aisles. I HATED THOSE. MY opinion is that deep aisles should be reserved for big boxes only. No small boxes. It's too hard to go through 30 - 50 boxes with a reach tool. You wanna climb in just to get to it quicker but that's dangerous (don't do it). You do have to lift some heavy boxes....not anything that requires two people but heavy enough where you will say it's heavy in your head. I felt a little weak for the job sometimes. This isn't a job for people who get hurt easily or tire easily or who have physical health issues, like back problems....The aisles I loved were the pallet/rainbow aisles. On those, you don't have to look for a specific package 98% of the time...the whole bin is all the same product with no sticker, so you just grab one, put the sticker on and scan it. That's it. With all that said, I didn't hate picking but I didn't love it either. It's one of those jobs where if you like a challenge of finding stuff fast (like on those hidden picture games) you may like this position. It's very isolated work (which I personally loved) but that's not for everybody. You cannot wear headphones (which sucked) because it's quiet otherwise. The 3day (10 hr each day) training consisted of a lot of sitting and waiting...when we weren't doing anything, we watched videos ...a big waste of time learning stuff that barely affected me. On the 2nd day I started to learn how to drive the PIT and practice. You practice on wire guided aisles and non wire areas. That was fun to finally get hands on after hours of sitting The previous day and half of day 2. The lesson on how to actually find boxes lasted only 10 minutes at the most which makes no sense to me as that was the thing I did the most. They should give you tips and tricks on how to do it quickly. They don't. The people are okay. No one is mean or nasty... Just felt like no one was necessarily happy to be there. Understandable. The people in HR are super nice. Great attitudes.\u00a0 I ended up leaving for another facility because I needed a better schedule (I was reduced time flex but had to do 30 hours a week and could never get in that frequently) . If it had been closer to my house and only 15 hours a week, I may have stayed a little while longer.

The issue is the stocks were nowhere near what people who came in at L4's got. L4's coming in get close to 60K in extra compensation over 4 years coming in. When I promoted I got 15K over 3 years. What kind of person would be willing to do the same job as their peers and get paid 10K less a year while providing a better performance. There really is no rhyme or reason to L4 or L3.
