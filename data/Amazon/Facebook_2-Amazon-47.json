Management wanted me to scan when there was no room for scanners they sent me back to inbound. Then punished me for it. Told me I had to scan for 2 weeks EVEN after scanning for four days already. Then told me they were never going to train me for inbound. Whatever no big deal. But they treat everyone like a child. It\u2019s demoralizing and demeaning. My real issue though is with their scheduling. They add time to your schedule in a sneaky and nefarious way designed to fast track you out the door. They would wait until after my break then add time to my schedule because they knew I couldn\u2019t check my phone. Then they don\u2019t tell you when you\u2019re supposed to clock out. So if a supervisor tells you to clock out at a certain time if it happens to be more than 5 minutes before your scheduled clock out time. They give you a half attendance point. 6 points and you\u2019re fired. They don\u2019t care and won\u2019t fix it. In fact I think they do this on purpose to keep the door revolving so they can brag about constantly hiring people. \n\nNUMBER 3: The lies; retaliation; hostile work environment \nDangerous work conditions \n\nYou have to deal with everyone being a liar and out to screw you over.
