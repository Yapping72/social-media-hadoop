The better your rate, though, the more they expect you to keep that up constantly, whether you\u2019re ahead of most people or not. And if you\u2019re not at \u201cyour\u201d normal, several people will nag you \u201care you okay\u201d with the dumbest look on their face. They all show up one at a time with that same dumb look.

It\u2019s probably 5 or 10 minutes to and from, honestly. Pee quickly because they\u2019re timing you. Literally. You cannot have an emergency pee or #2. That is the unthinkable. Seriously anxiety-provoking thought. I mean, I can\u2019t imagine that ever working out well for anyone. Then, you\u2019d have to walk another 10 minutes or so past a bunch of people to leave. Just no. \n\nDo you think you\u2019d like driving a little lift truck thingy that puts you four stories up in the air in very narrow aisles where you have to pull stuff off shelves and load it into the wobbly cage attached to your little lift? No? Me, either.

But, as a second career/ job after retiring from a 20-year long occupation: screw it. It\u2019s not worth it. I don\u2019t want to hold my pee, walking 10 minutes on painful feet, sweating like crazy with my potty time being monitored and showing up on a badge tracker\u2014for $15 an hour. No thanks.

A L4 - L5 promotion generally requires approval from peers, and strong technical skills (although anything on top of that will help), and a L5 - L6 promotion requires approval from those who are outside of engineering disciplines, as well as managers at higher levels. Your manager is incentivized to help you move to the next stage because their performance reviews are based on how well the team they manage do\r\n\r\n- A true meritocracy - you are rewarded based on your performance and you can speak up against leaders (respectfully, of course) if you disagree - I've never felt the need to back down just because I was \"just an engineer\" - if you have a good idea, everyone is willing to listen and act upon it if appropriate", "cons": "- No free lunches / inconvenient to find places to eat at pre-COVID, cafeteria offered limited choices\r\n\r\n- Only 6 public holidays observed per year\r\n\r\n- Compensation heavily skewed towards stock options over base salary (the increase in your base is fairly trivial compared to packages at equivalent levels at Facebook and Google), although the total sum tends to even out\r\n\r\n- Sometimes I did feel there was lack of technical leadership - L4 and L5 engineers often had to take up responsibilities typically assigned to L6 engineers (because it's very hard to hire frontend engineers, let alone a senior one) - it was harder on us because we had to gate the quality of the project, think about architectural concerns without lessening the scope of the work we were expected to deliver, which was at times stressful\r\n\r\n- Engineers from different teams I spoke all shared one thing in common - \"understaffed, and overworked\" (the management of the workload can be manageable with a good manager, but it doesn't change the fact that a lot of teams simply don't have funding to hire the engineers to cope with the workload that comes in)\r\n\r\n- High turnover - in the one year I was on this team, 9 engineers left - that's around 50% of our team size - vacancies are often hard to fill for frontend roles in particular, which means that there's additional stress imposed on existent members to lead and mentor new engineers on top of project work\r\n\r\n- Frontend engineers are a relatively new job title, which means that they're vastly outnumbered by their backend counterparts - it's easy to feel neglected, as well as having a preference to lean towards backend solutions over frontend ones. Oftentimes, there are much less frequent design reviews simply because there are no senior enough engineers to help out with reviews\r\n\r\n- Amazon is still very heavily Java focused. Unfortunately, this means that as a frontend engineer, you won't see the strong support and widespread support for Javascript, and indeed, TypeScript, you'd typically see at a smaller dev shop or a consultancy (by support, I mean the sort of expertise I expected to see at a top notch tech company was noticeably absent - there were more TypeScript and JavaScript experts in a small consultancy I used to work in)\r\n\r\n- On a similar note, so if you want to explore something with a different tech stack (not just programming languages), you have to fight through hurdles after hurdles to get it approved, not because managers or the team doesn't know those are superior technical solutions, but simply because there's insufficient expertise to properly design architectures and solutions around new tech\r\n\r\n- Code quality can be lacking at times - this is not a statement against the technical prowess of engineers, but the fact that Amazon values agility over quality - code bases have a shelf life, and are expected to be rewritten after a period of time. This means that architecturally sustainable engineer practices are often sacrificed for delivery and meeting deadlines\r\n\r\n- At times, you'll see the \"this is how it's done, so let's stick to it\" mentality to prefer the status quo over revolutionary change depending on the project you're working for. I would've expected to see more risk taking, but unfortunately the more conservative approach is preferred because they tend to get approved more easily up the management chain vs. having to justify something that's totally new or never been done before"}, {"review_title": "An ok beginning job", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Shopper in Cary, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexibility \nCo workers friendly\nNothing else", "cons": "Communication\nQr codes \nNew bag style"}, {"review_title": "Good for someone who doesn't pay their own housing rent", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Packer in Columbus, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Could apply to any shift since I was flex", "cons": "Too much hustling and overworking encouraged"}, {"review_title": "Terrible", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Warehouse Worker in Ama, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Terrible\u2026 bad work environment.

Next con, I \"can\" be paid for my ten hours of work but there are stipulations. So, I have to work against the gps, do ten hours of work in less than seven hours, and once I am through I have to work to get paid what I deserve. I won't go into the details for the pay but I cry myself awake everyday. Speaking of, everyday I have no choice but to run. If anyone had told me the truth I would have chosen better but I'm stuck in it. No one was upfront with me until after my first drive. They verbally dressed me down. Everyday I am out there I have to do certain things in order to meet the time stipulations. So just know if you take this job, when you get out there it is either your family or the customer. Every stop I make I have to tell myself this. You will end up doing the opposite of everything they tell you to do in training. I'm just waiting to get fired at this point, I am sure I'm not the only person. For your body my advice would be buy 520 numb and a strong aspirin. You won't make it otherwise.

Certain plans might look good on paper, but in reality do not work. Too many factors involved. During COVID-19, they preach safety and \"6 feet!\". But the working conditions make that reality impossible. Managers are CONSTANLY worrying about their rates and numbers. Most are always walking around staring at their computers, oblivious to the piles of packages overflowing along the isles. It has only gotten worse in the last 6 months or so. Slower and steadier works better than fast, faster, and fastest, and then having a huge backlog to sort out at the end. There is no reward for good work, just punishment.

The lazy people get away with murder. A recent snow day cancelled deliveries. A few workers made it in and they did do work. Most did not come in. Then management decided to close the facility anyway and pay everyone their normal pay. That is fine except there was no extra pay or rewards, or anything for the few who actually did come in and did do their work during icy and dangerous conditions. The management cannot figure why those workers who did come to work are disgruntled about that.\r\nNow, Amazon is moving towards \"megacycles\". Instead of various partitme shifts with flexible hours, they want to go to 1:30 am to 11:30 am four days a week. This job is extremely physical. Current workers in the overnight shift can easily do five to seven miles, and the morning shift can do 10 miles in four hours. This isn't simple walking, it is carrying boxes up to 50 pounds and pushing carts. Combining these two shifts will be exhausting. Numerous other locations have had this happen to them and they aren't too happy. Talks of strikes and union orginazing are a reality. People are not robots. It is totally senseless."}, {"review_title": "Great place for those who wanted to grow faster", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 May 2021", "job_title": "Recruiter in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great platform for learn, fast paced environment, great techs and people, you never done learning here, very positive culture drives you to improve yourself and gain great exp", "cons": "fast paced, pressure is high"}, {"review_title": "Amazing work place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Data Analyst in Chennai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work environment and friendly", "cons": "nothing that i know of"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Process Associate in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits Time off 3 days off", "cons": "Work life balance chaotic at times"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "25 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Garden Grove, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of hours and flexibility", "cons": "The con is the pay rate"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Associate in Brampton, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and lunch room", "cons": "To much hard work, feels like robo"}, {"review_title": "Low salary", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Human Resources Specialist in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They provide good working environment.", "cons": "Low salary for a lot of work."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Support Engineer in Chennai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Workplace and workculture is nice", "cons": "None that I can think of"}, {"review_title": "Good workplace", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Seller Support Associate in Calcutta", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Healthy environment.

At face value to a candidate, the work sounds interesting, but it definitely isn't. The code bases are full of short term thinking and their attitude to difficult problems is to throw more people at it, rather than try and be efficient - people get promoted for shipping crap, not for sustainable engineering. I have felt my tech skills get worse and worse the longer I've worked there for. In addition you will likely get about 0 base salary increase during your time there. They justify this by stating the shares allocated have gone up, so they don't need to pay you more. In addition to no real rewards after the initial big bonus to lure you (which you will pay for with your sanity), there's also a US-style stack ranking process where your manager is your friend one minute and stabs you in the back the next. Whilst you might think this only happens to the bad ones, I have seen good engineers forced out, so everyone that knows how it works lives in constant fear, those who don't know just aren't aware of the game they're playing and will eventually get caught out. On top of being crap to their engineers, all the stories you read in the papers about firing people for trying to unionise and stand up for their rights is true. The fact they try to cover it up externally just makes it that much more sickening. If you have any self-respect, stay away, it's not worth it just to have the name on your CV. The joining bonus is lucrative, but that's the only redeeming feature."}, {"review_title": "The best place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Sortation Associate in Eggolsheim", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone who works at Amazon gets to know very nice and well-educated people.
