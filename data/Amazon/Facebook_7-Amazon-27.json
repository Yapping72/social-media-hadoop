Ambitious project timelines with no experience on the subject matter or time to conduct the project.\n\nD. Resources for projects are slim or none, therefore, projects will be made by non-technical people trying to learn technical skillsets. The project quality is poor and leadership does not care - as long as they can say they have something to show.\n\nE.

Not everywhere trains it's managers to treat those under then with respect. Not every workplace puts the welfare of all of their employees first. I do believe whole-heartedly that this is what sets Amazon apart.  I have the best manager I have had in my lifetime in the workforce, and practically everyone you ask for assistance is willing to help, and mentor you.

Everyday my body hurts more than it has in a long time, but I always leave with a smile, and wake up ready to go back to work.
