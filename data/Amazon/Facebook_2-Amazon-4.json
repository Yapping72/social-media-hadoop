Structure and documentation - What I said above about structure and documentation, while its great to create clarity and shape your thinking, it can get in the way of actually doing your work. Everybody at Amazon is juggling so much and constantly writing high quality documents can get exhausting. The secret here, as in any job, is to balance the strategic against the operational and prioritize ruthlessly. I cannot say I was always effective at it - but I tried till my last day and now have the benefit of hind sight as well :-) 2. Culture - I think some people could have a tough time adjusting to the culture - its tough, expectations are high and there is not always a lot of hand holding ( in fact, it would be very rare). I think you have to embrace or at least accept it and focus on the positives. Your team makes a huge difference - so hopefully you're lucky and end up with a great manager and great team mates. If you're looking for free food and onsite massages - you certainly will be disappointed. You can end up overworked and resentful if you are not good at prioritizing your work and your life and making trade-offs. 3. People/Politics - I started to see a lot of the \"we are the best in the world\" mentality start to show up. I don't believe that everyone that works at Amazon is a genius and seeing that attitude crop up every now and then was annoying. Every company has inside politics and even though Amazon tries really hard to believe there is no politics, there is certainly that to deal with. No more than any other company that I can tell, but it can get frustrating when you're working so hard and so long to get derailed by that kind of thing."}, {"review_title": "It's a great company to work with.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Jan 2023", "job_title": "HR Assistant in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Connection you get to make.

My team is amazing and everyone gets along - It's definitely a tight knit community, but you need to get placed on a good team to have a good time at Amazon. The team is what makes or breaks it, in my opinion. The compensation is great for a fresh college grad and it's a HUGE plus. Flexible work hours are also great, but it depends on your manager. My manager allowed my team to pick their working hours since our team is spread out across the nation and we're all in different time zones.

Tip: Schedule 1:1s ASAP to get to know your coworkers! It's a tough job to source for candidates who are eligible for the role(s) you are trying to fill at Amazon.
