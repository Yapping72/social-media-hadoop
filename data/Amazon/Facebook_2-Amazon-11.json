You are required to have more in-depth networking knowledge incase something happens, ie WAN troubleshooting when something goes down, but they have other teams that handle the actual in-depth stuff. During the interview I thought I would be doing more in depth networking/configurations on equipment, but day to day it is fixing printers and supporting the hardware onsite + the warehouse. Still great experience and a good resume builder for those wanting to move up in IT, and you can move internally within the company - unlimited potential if you put the work in/gain certifications and knowledge for other roles, ex can move to software, AWS, security or the network development team, Amazon has everything - and they don't restrict you, you can move internally after about 3 months or transfer for any reason. It's very nice in that aspect - I've had other jobs where you have to wait a full year before being able to transfer.", "cons": "Rotating on-call - only in 4 day intervals (depending on area), but if you don't like the idea of having to be on-call and being responsible for bringing the site back up at any given hour/driving 3 hours to a site at 2am, do not recommend - also, if you quit before the full year you have to pay back your bonus at a prorated rate, so if you end up not liking the idea of on-call (which many don't) you're kind of stuck. They have other jobs without on-call requirements at a similar level/better pay band.\r\nBig pay discrepancy's between internal and external hires which leads to massive resentment of long term employees, which really brings down moral/leads to people who don't care anymore.\r\nAnother cons is that you're not working on the networking equipment, so if you dont use it you really lose it.

You are not a person at Amazon. It doesn\u2019t matter which warehouse you work at.

On top of that, this is the only company I\u2019ve ever worked for where you\u2019re held hostage by other departments not having finished their work. What I mean by that is there are many times where the people in my department have finished all of their work for the day, yet we\u2019re expected to stay and help any other departments that need it, so that we all leave at the same time. It results in some of us doing far more work than others, and the majority of the time, we\u2019re helping in areas we don\u2019t have training in, and that some of us have physical issues that prevent us from helping, yet we are docked some of our allotted time off if we choose to leave before they officially call \u201cEnd of Sort.\u201d If you run out of your allotted time off, you\u2019re fired. I\u2019ll word it a different way to drive the point home: You are fired for getting your work done and not physically being able to help another department that was too slow to finish in the same time. Sometimes the reason another department doesn\u2019t finish in time is because of management not planning correctly. They send people home early, all the time, to save on labor, then they just keep the rest of us there longer.
