I can't keep up with all the senior management turnover. \r\n- Turnover. Not a huge problem in my dept, but as a whole, Amazon has a large turnover rate, more so than most my previous jobs combined. Its hard work, long hours, not friendly to families or the elderly. \r\n- Constant Change. While this is a condition we signed up for, management is very unclear and nontransparent when it comes to such change. They observe you working with a stop watch and pedometer for a week, turn your dept upside down, raise rates, then expect you to 'adapt' and learn the new process.  \r\n- Promotion, or lack thereof.

So basically it\u2019s putting away random items in a storage bin driven by robots called Kiva\u2019s. Each item is varied by size and have appropriate bins by size (6, 9, 12, 16 and 18 inch) cubbies. A Kiva is called up to your station and you don\u2019t know what size bin that will pull up. So it\u2019s up to your judgment where items are stored. Sometimes there is not enough space to put away items or you get a line of small sized bins but all you have is large items (Like animal food, appliances and heavy items). So your work is judged by your UPH (Units per hour) and Tact time (Your average time putting an item away). They stress that fact that \u201cquality\u201d is very important (Like not making mistakes and putting items effeciently) but it obviously they stress you more on working faster. For me personally the faster you go, the chances of making mistakes is higher.  For breaks, your producticity time is effected even on our 10 minute breaks as well as our 30 minute lunch break. They say that essentially it\u2019s a 15 minute break because 1.5 minutes  to walk from your station to the break room or car, your 10 minute break and 1.5 minutes to walk back to your station.  If you are not stowing by the time your 15 minute break is over, it effects your productivity level as you \u201ctook a longer break\u201d and not currently working. As a newbie, we have 2 training sessions a week called \u201cLunar Landing\u201d. This session pretty much tells you how fast you should be working as weeks go on. So essentially they want you to work like a machine and not mistakes. Lastly they stress you on signing up for benefits. These training sessions are useless and repetitive.

From talking with other employees from other teams, and reading these reviews, I think it is somewhat the luck of the draw with Amazon - because teams are very independant and decentralized, your experience with one team can be wildly different from another.  Luckily, I believe I am on a very good one.\r\n\r\nManagement has been great, in my experience.  My manager is a coder/manager, so while he isn't the best project manager I've ever worked with, he works very hard to understand what is going on at a low level with the team, without micromanaging.  I rarely have had to deal with upper management, and when I do, the experience has been positive.\r\n\r\nWork/life balance has also been good.

Also, some smaller teams share pager duty, and while this means you are oncall less often, it also means that you can end up supporting code you know nothing about.\r\n\r\nAmazon's mantra of frugality slips a bit too far into the benefits.  While the pay is very good, the benefits are not.  There is no tuition reimbursement, 401k is sub par, and the health care is not cheap.\r\n\r\nWhile overall the decentralized nature of the company is a positive, it can be difficult to work with other teams.

In addition, the workload can be high if you find yourself in the wrong place - choose wisely.\r\n\r\nThe downside of free reign with teams is that there is often little consistency of behavior, as each team implements what it needs; this can cause problems if you need something not offered. It also impacts crosscutting concerns - coordinating multiple teams is almost impossible.\r\n\r\nPayments is a high stress area, as is anything that supports warehouses.

I understand that they want to move on up, but for some reason they have to go to another facility to do that, when that particular job opportunity is also opening up in same facility. It doesn't make any sense.  They also have a bad habit of hiring outside the facility and not promoting from within as much as they should. I don't know if there is some sort of quota the facilites have to go by, but plenty of associates have applied for tier 3 jobs only to have another employee from another facility get the job. \r\n\r\nThis last peak season we had issues with filling hiring slots. Amazon has been in our town long enough for the whole place to know what it is like to work here. I have heard from people \"on the street\" ask me what is going on over there, as they know people who have worked here and they do not want to go back. Every time it has been about the picking department. They all say the same thing; \"we feel that we are set up to fail\". Until the pick department takes care of this problem the hiring for peak may get worse and worse. The associates who work in the facility do not like to go to pick, and it has been like this for the 5 years I have been there.

So that's one. But primarily it's the way the people working there are treated. They don't care about you, simple as that. Of course one could argue it's not their job to care about you, it's your job to do the job you're hired for, and there are valid points along that line of thought, however they could treat their employees more like humans and less like cattle, or prisoners. \r\n\r\nDon't expect to have much time, or energy, for anything outside of work. It's not that it's a difficult job, in terms of how to do it, it's that they run you ragged, so that by the time you get home all you want to do is sleep. On the plus side, if you want to lose weight, it's pretty much perfect. You won't have much time to eat, and you'll be burning every calorie you might take in before it has a chance to settle anywhere. \r\n\r\nYou can talk to the same manager every day for a week. be off a day, wear something different the next day in and they've completely forgotten who you are. There's no structure and no communication between different management teams. You can be sent on what is supposed to be a quick side task and the manager that sent you to do such and such disappears the rest of the day, so you're left wandering around, but you can't go back to your dept because they've already pulled you out of it. \r\n\r\nYou don't get to choose what dept or position you get. It's based entirely on what they need, or think they need, the day you start, along with however many 100+ others that started the same day. And once you're in that dept that's it. There's no getting out. I lucked out and got a fairly decent job in packing. However a friend of mine who started at about the same time as I did, was stuck in picking. Well, with all the running and sweating, her asthma kicked in. She was taken out in an ambulance at least twice in the same week. When she asked to be moved to a different dept, SMX's response was \"No. Maybe you should just quit\".

If you have kids, or anyone else that might need to get hold of you in an emergency, you're given a help desk line to give to those people. The catch is, no one is ever around to answer the help desk line. \r\n\r\nQuotas: Every dept has a quota. 135 boxes per hour was the minimum in packing, and every item that goes in each box has to be scanned, with faulty hand scanners that either don't work or want to scan everything they come across. If you can't meet the quota you're out. So next time you order something from amazon and it looks like it was used for a football, it's because of the quota that packers, and pickers, and everybody else there have to keep up with. It's insane. Dropping the quota just 10% would save the company a lot of money in damaged items and returns, because less of the packages would be getting thrown around by their distribution workers and they could take a bit more time to pack a box carefully. I'm not joking when I say that if they could use cattle prods or whips on their workers, they most definitely would. \r\n\r\nFavoritism.

It happened to me twice. \r\n\r\nOn top of all that, the pay averages about $10 an hour. No benefits. After taxes, for a single person, you're better off picking up tin cans or mowing lawns. You'll make more and you won't be treated like cattle, or a criminal. On the plus side, they hire anybody that can pass a (rather extensive) criminal background check and a drug test, regardless of your work experience or work history, so there's really no excuse for most people to not get a job there, but don't expect it to be easy and don't expect any kind of respect. I did it for a short time because I needed the extra money. Next time I'll definitely plan better and look elsewhere.

As time goes on, standards have bottomed out, productivity has gone down, and morale is nonexistent.\r\n\r\nThink Big: This is supposed to mean \"think outside of the box\", but Management seems to think that means \"180 degrees from Reason\"\r\n\r\nBias for Action: Management moves so quickly that they can't even keep up with replacing their staff.\r\n\r\nFrugality: They have spent many many millions of dollars on security procedures that don't work.  They are continuing to try to force square pegs into round holes and spending a TRUCKLOAD of money to do it.\r\n\r\nVocally Self Critical: \"Deflect! Deflect! Deflect!\"  Management has not reversed a single terrible decision that they've made.  Quite the contrary, when it has been made even more obvious that their plans are stupid they buckle down and stubbornly plow ahead.  It hasn't worked yet.\r\n\r\nEarn the Trust of Others: Their orientation does a fantastic job of this.  The trust does not appear to be warranted.\r\n\r\nDive Deep: This is supposed to mean \"look below the surface\" and keep digging until you find the problem.  When the bosses of my bosses were informed of the problems they quite obviously dismissed the complaints.\r\n\r\nHave Backbone; Disagree and Commit:  People who have a backbone are systematically run out of the facility by bad policy and horrible decisions.  The latest round is flipping the entire staff's personal lives on end every three months - a policy that doesn't apply to Managers.\r\n\r\nDeliver Results: The results that they are delivering are substandard and dishonest."}, {"review_title": "warehouse fulfillment outbound/inbound", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Apr 2015", "job_title": " in Breinigsville, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits if hired by Amazon; availability due to large number of workers needed for six weeks in peak season; good as seasonal job through ISS (but without benefits)", "cons": "labor rates designed to predict daily production of warehouse are unfair and inaccurate predictors of employee performance.\r\npartiality in assignments, depending on local manager; managers change frequently\r\nno physical accommodations for age-related handicaps without doctor excuse\r\nLabor targets designed for 25% bottom-skimming of least productive employees, most achieving 90-99% of labor rates."}, {"review_title": "not for everyone", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 May 2015", "job_title": "Fulfillment Associate in Jeffersonville, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay for easy work.

There are so many hard-working employees who really try to love their job and move up and be loyal to the company, but none of that is recognized by management. They pick their \"favorites\" who get the \"easy\" jobs, that are not rated, priority training, and groomed to move up, when people who actually deserve to move up get passed over. Employees are expected to move at a ridiculously high pace, doing the same repetetive task for 10-12 hours a day in the heat, on concrete floors, without getting switched, while the \"favorites\" get to pick what job they want to do. Getting written up is such a normal part of day-to-day, that whenever someone new is upset about getting written up, the general response is, \"don't worry, it happens to everyone\". During peak, in some functions, it is impossible to make rate, which will earn employees a write-up every week, and 3 will get an associate fired. Managers have the ability to \"overlook\" the write-up and prevent associates from getting more, but will only do so if the employee is one of the \"favorites\".  They say safety is their number one priority, but safety rules go out the window and managers will overlook safety violations to make rate, as long as the safety team is not watching.  Because of this, almost all associates dislike their jobs and cannot wait to leave. Also, almost no member managment has actually been an associate, because they are hired young and straight out of college, which would be great, but they don't understand, nor do they care about employees barriers. Management moves around so much thay in the 2 years that I was there, my direct manager changed 6 times and my ops managers changed 4. So, essentially, it is impossible to build any type of professional rapport with management. HR is only there to make the employees feel like there is a support system when things are happening that are wrong, but they don't really do anything unless they feel that the company is at immediate risk of a lawsuit if no action is taken. There had been managers that had HUNDREDS of complaints against them by multiple  people for unfair treatment, sexual harrasment, along with various other issues, and nothing was ever done until there was concret proof that they were a liability to the company. Company values are just words, nothing more. Management loves to hear them in interviews, but they are never actually utilized.

Amazon is big on its leadership principles. It's a source of truth to guide decision making. It works pretty well for deciding the scope of projects. It's also used to evaluate performance. Sometimes it's helpful, other times it feels like a lip service your manager has to do. Once, I was switching context to a new project, and my manager called me out for \"Bias for Action\" for not starting it quicker.

There was really only a couple that treated people consistently with some respect, the majority were just unnecessarily rude. Though AMZL was not evaluating employees on their scanning rate, it could be difficult to get even your 16 hours in due to being sent home early during slow weeks and so it becomes necessary to try to pick up hours on the scanning side, where it can be extremely difficult to meet their high scan rate demands. Managers on the scanning/ sort side generally don't know people by name since there's just too many coming and going, so it tends to be much less of a team environment than AMZL. Conversions to 'blue badge\" (regular part-time) positions only happen a couple times per year- after the Christmas peak in late January, then again whenever HR decides, which will likely happen before they begin hiring for the next peak season in the fall, so if you miss out on it the first time as I did, it's almost better to quit and try to get re-hired as a blue badge rather than be strung along by HR telling you that conversions \"will happen again soon\"--they won't.   At least that way you can earn the 12.75 that you did during the holiday season, and not bust your butt working for 11.50, which is what they set your pay at come Jan. 1st if you are seasonal. I say most of this to help those who may be going in as a seasonal person so they will know not to buy into anything HR says about seasonal employees once the rush is done. They will not just terminate you into any \"alumni program\"- there is no such thing. Just convert to a blue badge at the first opportunity- they will not make this clear to new people, so if you even think you want/need to be working there beyond January, just go to a blue badge.

There are a *lot* of reasons I'd recommend not working here; but the two that stand out are the culture and the hours. You will work a lot of hours in whatever dept. you're in, almost without exception. But the real overriding factor in everything that makes it such a horrible place to work - the one that all the other issues grow from - is its culture.\r\n\r\nHere's the long and short of it: front-line and middle managers here are really the 'bottom of the barrel' types. No self-respecting manager would try to manage any team in this environment (unless they didn't know anything about it when they were hired - ahem!), and that's because of one corporate-mandated policy that destroys any possibility of teamwork: Top Grading. Let me explain...\r\n\r\nTop Grading sounds like a good idea when you only look at the 'top' part. What that means is the top 10% of performers on each team get the bulk (or all) of the raises for that team that year. This happens every year (depending on your dept., anywhere from Feb.-May), and is something so pervasive in the company that you really do risk your job if you try to stand up against it (pretty much Bezos's idea - so if your chain answers up to a Sr. VP that answers to him, it's gonna happen).\r\n\r\nBut why stand against it? Well, let's say you have a great team, and everyone's pulling their weight. The problem with this policy is, it also includes what some have called Bottom Grading - appropriately named, as it spells out the rest of the truth of the happily named Top Grading. The full truth is, you have to get rid of the bottom 10% of your team every year - period, end of story, no arguments. Basically, Amazon's 'high bar' with 'bar raisers' in interview loops comes down to little more than an inflexible ideology.\r\n\r\nSo just try and make a team in that kind of environment! Even just trying to be part of one is horrific; after all, you could be next. It's either you or someone else on your team - probably a couple or more. And this includes managers and directors.\r\n\r\nI'm betting you can guess the result: a highly politicized environment, where everyone's going for the immediate win and doing their best to suck up to their boss at every moment, as once you're clued in, you realize your manager's or director's hands are tied.

There are a *lot* of reasons I'd recommend not working here; but the two that stand out are the culture and the hours. You will work a lot of hours in whatever dept. you're in, almost without exception. But the real overriding factor in everything that makes it such a horrible place to work - the one that all the other issues grow from - is its culture.\r\n\r\nHere's the long and short of it: front-line and middle managers here are really the 'bottom of the barrel' types. No self-respecting manager would try to manage any team in this environment (unless they didn't know anything about it when they were hired - ahem!), and that's because of one corporate-mandated policy that destroys any possibility of teamwork: Top Grading. Let me explain...\r\n\r\nTop Grading sounds like a good idea when you only look at the 'top' part. What that means is the top 10% of performers on each team get the bulk (or all) of the raises for that team that year. This happens every year (depending on your dept., anywhere from Feb.-May), and is something so pervasive in the company that you really do risk your job if you try to stand up against it (pretty much Bezos's idea - so if your chain answers up to a Sr. VP that answers to him, it's gonna happen).\r\n\r\nBut why stand against it? Well, let's say you have a great team, and everyone's pulling their weight. The problem with this policy is, it also includes what some have called Bottom Grading - appropriately named, as it spells out the rest of the truth of the happily named Top Grading. The full truth is, you have to get rid of the bottom 10% of your team every year - period, end of story, no arguments. Basically, Amazon's 'high bar' with 'bar raisers' in interview loops comes down to little more than an inflexible ideology.\r\n\r\nSo just try and make a team in that kind of environment! Even just trying to be part of one is horrific; after all, you could be next. It's either you or someone else on your team - probably a couple or more. And this includes managers and directors.\r\n\r\nI'm betting you can guess the result: a highly politicized environment, where everyone's going for the immediate win and doing their best to suck up to their boss at every moment, as once you're clued in, you realize your manager's or director's hands are tied. You walk on glass, and try not to *ever* cross them or give them a reason to put your name in the bottom 10%.\r\n\r\nSo that's it, in a nutshell - ideology 'tinkled down' from above loses to allowing managers to manage their own teams independently.

You are encouraged to THINK BIG, LEARN & BE CURIOUS, grow, exercise BIAS FOR ACTION and have real OWNERSHIP in work that is 'mission critical' and genuinely 'making history'.\r\nThe LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES (which can be found online) are earnestly employed and integral to day-to-day thinking, practices and processes.  The environment at Amazon holds a palpable energy and excitement that comes from a fervent commitment to HIRE AND DEVELOP THE BEST. Being among the best-of-the-best, folks who ARE RIGHT, A LOT, and being brought together to collaborate and contribute is incredibly stimulating and rewarding.  \r\nSenior management and company tenants impressively INSIST ON HIGHEST STANDARDS, and CUSTOMER OBSESSION is a real and seriously held litmus test for all activity!  This EARNS TRUST and is a huge \"pro\" in my book.\r\nHonestly, there have been some VERY dark days that have demanded I call upon personal and internal fortitude to navigate forward, and I am pretty sure there may be more of them in the future.  However, the personal and professional lessons learned within those times are invaluable, and I am incredibly thankful for them.\r\nThe philosophy of Amazon is incredibly energizing.  I cannot think of another company that is innovating at the scope and scale that Amazon is.  It is thrilling and a sincere honor to be able to make history, to feel accomplishment for your hard work and I really do have fun while doing so.\r\n2 days out of 10, I am regrouping to fortify my resolve and get to work, but the other 8... I am 'Tap Dancing into Work!'", "cons": "The scope and scale of Amazon demands that you DELIVER RESULTS - fast!  The ambiguity of the ever adjusting and evolving environment can make it very difficult to DIVE DEEP, and resources must be prepared to HAVE BACKBONE and speak up when things seem to be going off of the rails. \r\nUnfortunately, this does not always go well with middle management and this seems to be where MANY MANY resources get chewed up and spit out. The mid-stream environment can be very political, with your immediate manager holding your growth and development - a process with a lot of ambiguity - firmly in their hand.  This is highly concerning, especially if you have excised your 'backbone' (as is expected), and then had to 'DISAGREE AND COMMIT'.  Many managers at the midpoint have a very difficult time not letting this activity impact their opinion of resources, especially if the manager is new to Amazon, which is all too frequently the case.  This can indisputably derail your growth and promotion opportunities within the company.  This 'power' results in a lot of favoritism, biases and deflating activity by middle management that undoubtedly skews development and promotion opportunities.  A middle manager can make or break your career path based on their fondness of you.  This means that in order to be successful you have to acknowledge the ambiguity within the process, be resilient and push past road blocks.  It requires strong personal fortitude and a great attribute, but can take its toll on morale and enthusiasm, all too often yielding counter-productive results.   \r\nNot all teams are created equal, and some teams celebrate diversity in thought, while others double-down on being likeminded and cast alternative thought as 'maligned', 'wrong-fit' or 'just not on the same page'.  This can be soul crushing if you are supported by data, but constantly feel like the 'odd man out'.\r\nThe same amazing approach and willingness to constantly innovate can lead to stressful periods when unproven processes are employed. Think 'high density' and 'open concept' seating.  Smart and FRUGAL business practices may support the approach, but the stress on the employee who has become the 'test monkey' can really take its toll."}, {"review_title": "You can thrive here, if you are self-directed and own it", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Dec 2017", "job_title": "Technical Evangelist in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "One of the first pieces of advice I read here before joining was that you have to be \"self-directed\", in that work here can be very uncertain and you have to figure out a lot of things on your own.

One of the leadership principles here is Ownership, and it is one that can guide you to a very fulfilling career, where you learn new stuff every day for many years.

There are positives of being largely federated (that is, teams are quite independent), and there are negatives (there can never be enough communication to have ideal coordination and avoid duplicity and optimal efficiency), but with such scale and federated independence comes the ability to experiment and solve very large problems.  Also, ambitious people can oftentimes get distracted by the wrong goals (obsessing about leveling up), but that can happen in companies large and small.  Key team leadership is critical, and although not all leaders are super efficient, there's plenty of excellent leadership that is of world-class caliber.

Some companies claim to care about customers, but from my experience working in retail management for other companies what they do does not even come close to what Amazon does. \r\n\r\nWe pioneer, innovate, and value the opinions of employees and customers at all levels . We truly listen to both customers and employees. I have personally worked on many initiatives to put Associate feedback into action. Some of the best ideas come from our front line employees. We listen to their feedback about barriers they face and improvements that can be made to make their job easier or better and we take action to improve those things quickly! This includes anything from adding more food options in the breakroom to making multi-million dollar investments into new technology, equipment, process improvements, etc. \r\n\r\nThe career opportunities are virtually limitless. While I was a leader in Operations within the Fulfillment Centers I personally reviewed resumes, helped with interview prep, provided opportunities for Associates to take on new and challenging roles, and personally promoted over 30 well deserving Associates from front line employees into Management positions in a span of only about 2-3 years. \r\n\r\nWithin my own career I have had an opportunity to run a department/area within a Fulfillment Center as an Area Manager where I was able to directly support, train, and mentor a large team of Associates. \r\n\r\nI was then able to transition into an ACES Continuous Improvement Manager role where I received expert level training, development, and experience on Lean Six Sigma process improvement strategies equivalent to that of a Black Belt. \r\n\r\nI got promoted into a Operations Manager role where I was managing other Operations Area Managers and leading a very large team of Associates in a Fulfillment Center. \r\n\r\nI was even able to participate in an innovative new rotational program where my only job was to listen to the needs of both Associates and Managers and ensure that their feedback for improvements got put into action as quickly as possible. We call this Voices in Action. This included anything from adding better flavors of creamer for the free coffee, to adding more fans for better airflow in specific hot spots in the FC, to providing career skills training to Associates wanting to promote and grow in their careers, to providing mentorship and development training to new managers still learning how to be great leaders. The fact that Amazon would invest so much into supporting its employees speaks volumes to the culture of the company and that they are not just talking the talk they are walking the walk. \r\n\r\nThrough my experiences within Operations I wanted to make a bigger impact on the way the we onboard, train, and continuously develop employees at all levels of the organization.

At most, you worked 5 days a week if needed.\r\n\r\nWarehouse work is not for everyone, I have worked in several warehouses Amazon has some pretty easy positions.

It is fairly easy to maintain these rates at a steady pace. This pretty much sums it all up.", "cons": "Couple downsides, however, you will find this with most warehouses.\r\n1. Despite the nationwide pay increase to $15 still low for how successful Amazon is.\r\n2. Poor management, some better than others though.\r\n3. Drama, even with some of the management. (This is typical with most companies)\r\n4. Slow pay raise scale.\r\n5.

Bosses are not bossy type they treat you with respect all time.", "cons": "The below points are for the Customer Service department of Amazon Hyderabad:\r\n\r\n1. Promotions are not based on the years you spent in the same process but it is a result of the metrics you maintain. This is bad for true people who cant lie to customers. People with malpractice have a better chance to grow. This is referred to as 'Smart work' and 'Hard work' has no value and I have seen people getting fired because of 'Hard work'.\r\n\r\n2. Favouritism (the practice of giving unfair preferential treatment to one person or group at the expense of another) exists. \r\n\r\nIf you work really hard, this doesn't matter sometime. You could be your manager's or lead's pet to grow.\r\n\r\n3. There is something called 'interim' in almost all next level job. This is easily understood as a 'testing period' for getting promoted in next level. This interim period can last for 3 months to 10 months and if you maintain your metrics then you'll be made / converted to permanent level. It is like You are at Level 2 position and you applied for next level which is L3. This will not be permanent L3. \r\n\r\nIts like Level 3 (current position) > Interim L4 >  L4 (permanent) or Go back to L3 (did not maintained your metrics).\r\n\r\nYou cannot pursue your passion. I moved to one of my favorite dream jobs 2 times,  6 months each by applying internally and still they sent me back to previous level. \r\n\r\n4. Unfair Salary. If you are working in Amazon and have 4 years of experience with say 2 lakhs per annum CTC. They hire the candidate externally with say 2 years of experience and offer them 4 lakhs per annum CTC. This is really bad about this company. They do not promote their own employees who are very much capable to do the job in Amazon way.\r\n\r\n5. No fun activity at all. The punch line of Amazon is 'Work hard, have fun, make history'. This should be updated to 'Work hard, Work hard, Work hard'.\r\n\r\nThey claim its a Great place to work. I ask, what is Google, Facebook then ?\r\n\r\n6. They hired lot of managers from HSBC and other cheap employee unfriendly companies and these managers are bringing those cheapness and unfriendliness along with them and implementing it here. Obviously they all have suffered in their previous company and they want to see Amazonian suffer so that this can give them a balanced satisfaction. One such example is, partially removing the cab facility (Home pickup to home drop) to  Shuttle transportation (Point pickup and point drop)."}, {"review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Warehouse Associate in Hazle Township, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Overall Amazon is an excellent place to work and I've truly enjoyed my time spent there.

By that time I was worn out, overwhelmed and overall just tired of the mindless work I was given. I was happy that they saw potential in me to become a full time regular employee, but I wasn't willing to move to another facility and possibly be put back into learning mind-numbing work. \r\n\r\nI came in expecting to be noticed that I had great work ethic and being a college graduate would hopefully be taken out of the group for a more professional position.

Given Amazon fast paced work culture, you learn a ton, quickly.\r\nI've learned more in my almost 2 years at the company than 3-4 years elsewhere. This is a great place to be if you value learning and want to optimize for learning in your career: the career progression opportunities abound if you perform well. Competitive name on resume, intelligent coworkers, fast paced culture where you are consistently challenged, flexible work hours", "cons": "The salary is quite low when compared to hours worked. Amazon's compensation is awarded over time (4 years), where compensation comes with a lower base pay, stock and signing bonus. The average Amazon employee lasts 2 years, so you may not realize all these benefits. Stocks don\u2019t vest completely until you have completed 4 years with the company. 401k match is not earned until 3 years of service. Sign on bonus isn't earned until you complete 1 full year with the company. If you leave or are forced out prior, it must be repaid on a pro-rated, annualized basis. Relocation bonus and expenses also have to be paid back if you leave within 2 years (pro-rated). Amazon espouses frugality and uses these deceptive tactics to lock talent into a contract where employees are promised fake money, awarded over a very long period of time, during which many employees either quit, or are forced out of the company.\r\n\r\nIn regard to compensation, I would push to come in as an L5 Brand Manager instead of L4 Brand Specialist. L5s typically come in at an $84K annual salary + stock, whereas L4s are usually $65K + $20K signing bonus + stock.  Total compensation between the roles is almost the same \u2013 with one key difference. Within 2 years as a brand specialist, you have to get a promotion to an L5 to have it make financial sense to continue (unless you want to take a $20K pay cut as the signing bonus is only valid for 2 years). Promotions at Amazon can be very challenging, so negotiating to an L5 upfront can be beneficial if you want to stay at Amazon long term. Also, annual increases are very minimal, on average 1-2% per year, if that each year. As an L4, you almost feel expendable, where the 1st 2 years are a test to see if you qualify to stay and the company and move up to a more steady pay grade as an L5. I would use prior work experience and top tier education to push to come in as an L5, one thing I wish I knew prior to joining Amazon.\r\n\r\nLack of Appreciation: One of the primary drivers of attrition within this role. There is NO positive reinforcement at Amazon. On the occasional blue moon someone will pat you on the back and congratulate you for a great win (it is rare- believe me). If something goes wrong, it can be blown out of proportion and magnified. Can be demoralizing over time.\r\n\r\nConstant stress/anxiety: The bar at Amazon is constantly rising and you have to go above and beyond and constantly push yourself to make a name for yourself. Leadership and management have to know who you are, and the value you bring to the table. Stack ranking does occur during the annual review process, often times based on favoritism and can be political, at times. The work environment is competitive, cut throat, Darwinian (the strong survive, weak perish). I\u2019ve seen people disappear, cry at their desk, get yelled at, and just walk out and leave the company. Amazon has a culture that embraces conflict, and disagreement amongst people \u2013 it\u2019s very much and a love or hate place to work (little grey area between love or hate). If you embrace conflict, Amazon may be a great fit. \r\n\r\nHigh turnover: You have very limited time for family, social life, etc. due to work commitments. The expectation is that you are available 24/7, though no one will tell you this directly. Workload varies by team and time of year. I would not recommend Amazon as a place for someone who has a family, looking to start a family or enjoys having a social life. Even if you are sick, there is constant pressure to work (from home) and get stuff done.\r\n\r\nIncompetent management: Some managers do not know or have no experience managing teams, making it difficult to grow, develop and feel challenged.\r\n\r\nConstantly dealing with ambiguity. The company has a very self-reliant culture, so make sure you are comfortable managing ambiguous situations and can drive results. You teach yourself everything at Amazon, no one will hold your hand and walk you through things. There are a lot of type A personalities that when leading projects across leadership, you can be told 5 different things from 5 different people across teams. Gaining alignment across leadership and buying groups is a HUGE ISSUE and causes inefficiency when leading and executing projects.\r\n\r\nI would think hard about signing for this role or use it as a short term learning opportunity. Biggest challenge is as an L4 you feel like a workhorse or object and completely expendable, churning out work for leadership with almost no credit for it. Also, one IMPORTANT note: Amazon does not pay for the brand specialist role. It is paid for by the vendor through vendor funding (about $300K annually). So, to put simply, Amazon is MAKING money on this position (one of Amazon's core tenets is frugality). They will not tell you this upfront, but people usually find out after joining. In conversations with vendors, the typically re-evaluate whether they need the brand specialist role in annual negotiations, which can make you feel completely expendable. Respect in the workplace is vitally important, and unfortunately, Amazon doesn't have any of it."}, {"review_title": "Challenging and exciting place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Aug 2016", "job_title": "Operations Research in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazon is ambitious and willing to take risks in business, that allows its employees to have a real impact through their work.

LOL no, that would make life easy. To be approved for that, you need to be literally 4 levels up from the bottom! Root access on your Desktop? Nah, but they'll give you sudo, but you can't actually use your desktop for development -- you'll have to work through a VM. And to make sure you don't enjoy it, your development VM will be some ancient Red Hat image, with absolutely nothing newer than 5 years old (literally!). Just in case you ever want to google something, all the libraries/function/features made in the last half-decade won't work.\r\n\r\nThe internal systems at Amazon are so painful, that I suspect that a large percentage of employees after a hard-days work, come home and put needles in their arms for fun. When stuff works, its slow and largely unusable, and a dozen times worse than any freeware you'll find on the internet. The source control, build systems and all other developer tools seem like it was developed by a retarded monkey after he drank too much that night. Apparently they're now working on an \"internal github, that works on more SCS than just git -- and has an awesome advanced security model\". I wonder why they don't try get their page-load times under 10 seconds first. \r\n\r\nEven things that you thought were solved 20 years ago, Amazon manages to break with their own special flavor of retardedness. Like the mailing lists. It's an accepted fact, that it's impossible to *reliably* filter a message to a folder, because the send is not from the mailing list -- there is no mailing list header, and no required subject prefix! Another great joy is, after sending a message to a mailing list, your inbox will lag for *literally* the next 5 minutes, as you get spammed by \"Out of Office\" replies. But no one excepts the Amazon workplace to be functional or enjoyable, so this is just the normal.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, then there's the bureaucracy. At first, you'll try fight it, and try do what's best for the company. But soon you'll realize, like half the company is nothing but paper-pushers -- and you can easily waste a month just trying to get approval for some trivial thing. In the end, you'll be a lot happier here if you treat it as a job, don't try fight it, don't try enjoy it, put in your hours and leave at the end of the day (hoping your pager doesn't wake you up in the middle of the night, over some stupid issue)"}, {"review_title": "Fun place to work, great people, work hard to move up.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Oct 2013", "job_title": "Associate in Shepherdsville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to move up if you work hard and make the right connections.

Don't even ask about getting Amazon to pay for journal subscription -- you are expected to scrounge papers from friends still in academia or off the Internet. The \"mentors\" I had were largely useless and it is virtually impossible to earn a promotion without superhuman efforts, i.e., having no work-live balance.  In addition, there is a culture of micromanagement which comes down from the top.  This attitude makes it difficult to research and to solve important problems which are costing the company millions.  And, this is not limited to a single manger -- I had five in two years, all of whom were worse than any manager I had in my 25-year career prior to Amazon.\r\n\r\nWhen you attempt to make changes, it can take six months or more of politicking and fighting the Agile/scrum schedule to launch your improvement into production.   Amazon takes the leadership principles seriously, but \"Deliver Results\" and \"Bias for Action\" trump everything, even correctness.  No one seems to remember who made $50MM mistakes, but they do remember who didn't deliver the XYZ feature on time by giving up endless evenings and weekends.\r\n\r\nNext, read the fine print on everything you sign.  Amazon has many pernicious ways of clawing back money from you when you leave, e.g., you must stay two years to avoid repaying relocation expenses and you will only receive matching contributions to your 401(k)  if you stay three years.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the infrastructure is \"frugal\" and often unreliable.

But since it converted to Amazon the people seem like zombies and the rules are a tad but too much. \r\n\r\nTHEY WILL HIRE ANYONE; when I say this there are some people who are either really rude, lazy or try to cut too many corners. Just the other day I saw a man kick a bunch of shoes and cuss about how stupid Amazon was because he could not find a cart for picking. Really? Does Amazon put that pressure that if we can't find a cart we could be fired because we won't make rate? Or do they hire just anyone who would fly off the handle like that? Then you have some people who will sit in the isle and talk on their phones. No joke, but if I look at my Ipod I could get yelled at because I am a temp and not a blue badge. \r\n\r\nTraining was poor. My job is so easy a monkey could do it, but there were some things that came up and I needed to know the companies policy on and I would be ignored or I couldn't find the person who trained me. So I figured out how to cheat the gun and make it do what I wanted to until I figured out how to fix my previous problem, on my own. \r\n\r\nAlso, they will call overtime constantly. But during the week they will VTO people and once overtime day comes they ask you to go home within the hour.

The pay is decent for a company that will hire just about anyone. The starting rate at my warehouse (Robbinsville, NJ) is $12.75 with a 50 cent raise for working at this specific location and another 50 cents for choosing the night shift. There is some opportunity for overtime pay as well, especially during Amazon's peak season which occurs between Nov-Dec. \r\nThe benefits are very good. They offer medical, vision, dental, 401k, educational assistance, and 4 shares of stock that must accrue for 2 years before they can be sold. They also offer medical leave and an extensive paid leave for parents expecting childbirth. \r\nThe only other pro to this company is how they offer time off to their employees, but eventually this system fails for many employees after a few months. When you first become employed you are responsible for managing 3 types of time-off you are allowed to use: Unpaid time off, Paid time off, and Vacation time. While they start you off with an abundance of hours at your disposal, improper use of this time will quickly come back to haunt you if you're not careful. Also, if you go below 0 hours of unpaid time, you will be terminated, no matter what excuse you have for not being at work. Most employees staying at Amazon for more than 3-4 months will find themselves with little to no time left to take off from work if they do not stockpile them.", "cons": "Where do I begin...I'm just gonna start rambling.\r\nFirst off, the hours are awful. 10 hour shifts four days in a row really wear away at your tolerance of warehouse work. At first I didn't think it would be so bad, but the monotony of the job really starts to eat at your happiness. Personally, I live 45 minutes away from the building, so in total I dedicate 13 hours towards Amazon daily when I add commute times (this includes leaving extra early to get food). I manage to get 8 hours of sleep but I only have a few hours to myself every day. It's not fun, you wind up being exhausted and sleep through your extra time. You will not have any free time. It's even worse when they add an extra hour every day and an extra day to your schedule during peak season.\r\nWith so many people in the building, you're bound to get mixed opinions of them, both good and bad. The overall culture isn't so great since everyone is usually complaining about the job. Management isn't the worst but it could be much better, there are often minor gripes among employees daily. \r\nThe job itself (as a stower) is the worst aspect of this whole job. You're job is to take items off a cart and stow them into cubby holes...for 10 hours a day. If you have something next to you, try picking it up and placing it somewhere else, then putting it back where you found it. Repeat for 10 hours. On top of that, management will be disappointed if you don't achieve a certain rate per hour and will even take disciplinary action. \r\nEventually I moved up to problem solver, which was a more stimulating position since I used a laptop to fix any issues with the items that must be stowed. While this was a more satisfying job, management ended up screwing most of us out of the position by hiring too many and then picking favorites. I went from problem solving almost every day to getting it once or twice every two weeks, sometimes even less. Additionally, problem solving is a position with a tier 2 salary within most fulfillment centers, but the Robbinsville location only considers it to be tier 1. \r\nThere are many other issues myself and other employees have with this place, but like I mentioned in the beginning, it's not a bad place if you're looking to go elsewhere within a few months.

Meaning, noone cares about your career development, promotion, satisfaction, etc. You are left to your own devices because they can replace you by tomorrow. \r\nThere is a corporate-wide incentive within Amazon, to address low satisfaction and high fluctuation across marketers, because people feel stuck, exploited, and they leave. \r\nIf you are considering a marketing job at Amazon, know that it's most likely a very monotonous job that entails operating outdated highly-manual tools that are built on series of workarounds (tech got more important things to do) and not even tool's PMs know how to use them. There is no creativity, no budget, no attention from the leadership (only if you fail).  And yet, you will be expected to deliver results working with these user-unfriendly tools, and perform series of monotonous jobs, while having no reliable support (there is literally no effective onboarding for most of them - you have to ask someone who knows the workarounds to teach you!). And you will be expected to perform all kinds of tasks outside of your marketing role (like writing extensive SQL queries because there are no BI resources available for this 'unimportant' job- again with no onboarding or support, so prepare to pester your neighbors) just to stay in the role. And if you ask for any help, they tell you to find mentors. That's it! It seems like all eyes are on tech and everything else, is just not important enough. \r\n\r\n- Your salary actually drops over time:\r\nIf you don't get promoted within a specific time frame, your salary effectively decreases. They won't tell you that ever, though. You only find out after a few years. \r\n\r\n- People are excluded from promotion based on their personality:\r\nIt's an ongoing popularity contest. Prepare to look or talk in a specific way to get good reviews. If you complain or show frustration, you are out. If you are a female/minority, you get to work twice as hard.\r\n\r\n- Isolating and inhumane work environment: \r\nIt's a shark pool -  most people are anxious to talk to each other because it will be used against them. And if you need something from someone else, they will most likely not even respond to your email. Amazon employees are better off being robots.\r\n\r\n- No agency for work-related issues: \r\nFind a mentor, they will tell you. HR is not able to assist you.

Everyone feels a strong sense of ownership in the systems they build. You are not just a code monkey.\r\n\r\nThe decentralized nature also means that the employee experience may vary depending on what part of the company you work in, so my observations may differ from those of others. (If you're working on base-level functionality such as the order pipeline, you will have different pressures placed upon you than someone working on higher-level or internal-facing features.)\r\n\r\nOne of Amazon's core values is frugality--a fact which doubtlessly helped the company survive the dot-com crash of the early 2000s, and should continue to serve it well during periods of economic uncertainty. This adds a nice degree of confidence in the security of one's job.\r\n\r\nUpper management attitude is that we should always be innovating, and based on the features the company has launched over the past few years, you can tell they aren't just using that as a buzzword. Amazon is still a relatively young company, so there is still a willingness to experiment.\r\n\r\nLook forward to the mid-2010 move to Seattle's growing South Lake Union neighborhood. We're building a new campus from the ground up.

A typical example is one week of pager duty every 6-8 weeks, but the operational load varies considerably from team to team, so be sure to ask about it during your interview. (Typical Amazon development teams I've encountered consist primarily of SDEs with 1-2 management types; Microsoft-style \"test engineers\" are relatively rare, and all but a few teams handle their own operational support.)\r\n\r\nWhat is the line between \"frugal\" and \"cheap\"? This is one of the continuing debates among engineers, as Wall Street worries occasionally lead to the tightening of the purse strings. There may be some bureaucracy if you want to request new hardware, and periodic requests to justify your use of resources.

This level of freedom means that those teams which require strict SDLC methodologies to meet high availability requirements can apply those, while teams who do not require as strict of a methodology are also free to explore agile approaches.  There are lots of available tools for working in certain ways, but teams are not required to use those tools and are welcome to use others of their own choosing.  This freedom keeps the work environment fresh and interesting, even as Amazon has grown into a truly large company.\r\n\r\nThe other aspect of Amazon that is truly rewarding is the \"ownership\" attitude that is fostered.  Not code ownership, per se, but rather company ownership.  Any employee is encouraged to think about how the project they are doing improves customer experience, drives down costs, and overall improves the business.

You perform, you'll get attention, compensation, opportunities, you name it. They reward people who over-achieve.\r\n- Little politics. For a company this size, I'm amazed at how much a team environment it is. I would have expected different from a large corporate American company. Its not like that and you actually have to talk to your issues in front of your SVP.\r\n- Amazing people. Amazon is doing some ground-breaking stuff so naturally they have a lot of amazing people, but not just technically gifted. At Amazon, the soft skills are just as important as tech. So you get to work with people who you admire and look forward to working with every day. Its a team\r\n- Technology. Amazon is leading the way in Cloud-computing and across the rest of the company there are other really cool things happening. They have the scale only a handful of companies do. Its stuff you just don't get to see in other companies\r\n- Challenge. I doubt there is a company doing anything like Amazon is doing at the pace and scale they have.
