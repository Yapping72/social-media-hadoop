I attended day 1 after completing all required online training one of which is their covid-19 policy saying they are performing daily temperature checks on all employees, PROPER mask-wearing is being strictly enforced, as well as social distancing. After noticing that not only is this location NOT performing temperature checks, they are also not enforcing PROPER mask-wearing. The only thing this location IS enforcing is social distancing...but just barely. After bringing this to the attention of employee relations who in the end just shrugged it off, I put in my resignation. During the week (1st week of Jan 2021) while my resignation was finalized and my concerns were \"addressed\", I also received notification via their AtoZ app, that there were 4 days that they had a covid-19 outbreak at the facility.
