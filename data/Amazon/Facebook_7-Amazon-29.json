That said, let's segue into the first point: \n\n- As with all large tech companies, tech debt runs rampant, especially on direct customer-facing applications. The insane tech debt backlog can cause affected teams to divert ownership of a technical component to another team, even if that ownership model isn't the right one. Take this with a grain of salt; there are teams with smaller backlogs than others. Choose your team wisely!\n\nMeanwhile, here are some general cons I have:\n- Leadership sets very aggressive deadlines. In fact, more than half of the original project deadlines will get pushed back for reasons that aren't discovered until later. Be ready to crunch when deadlines approach and are ready to explain delivery delays when original deadlines aren't met.\n- Bureaucracy. As a large company with 1.2M+ employees, it is common for leadership to make decisions without involving all the right people along the way.\n- Away-team work. This is where you do development in an application your team doesn't immediately own. Away-team work is more common than you think at Amazon since project headcount isn't always sufficient. Beware of long-term away-team projects; the longer you spend on these, the harder it is to stay connected with your actual team. \n- Lots of meetings.

In my case, there was no just cause or review. I was employed for just about 4 weeks, left on my own without a training plan while my manager was on holiday. During this period was told to just observe the operations. I got tired of just standing around doing nothing and started doing online training through the company training portal. When my manager return from vacation, she instructed me to register for a compulsory training course which I did. The next day she fired me. As I said, I understand termination during probation but in this case? Just about 4 weeks into the job without supervision or training partner.\n\n Amazon preaches leadership principals, here is an example and see how this applies:\n\nStrive to be Earth\u2019s Best Employer\nLeaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what\u2019s next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees\u2019 personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.\n\nThat is one of the leadership principles which sadly was not implemented prior to or during my termination. \n\nNormally, when you are new to a company and still find your way your manager will guide you or assign a partner/mentor, not in this case. I was left alone, what evaluation was done on my performance or by whom that lead to my termination.\n\nNo, I am not disgruntled but rather angry at the situation that people can just fire you just because they can and do not have to explain or have just cause why, it's like playing GOD, I can and I will and there is nothing you can do about it. \n\nThey hide behind.......... \"it is in your probation period and we do not have to give you a reason\" So maybe the rumours of this Amazon station's reputation is true after all, maybe it is systematic discrimination.\n\nIt is managers like this that gives Amazon a bad name as an employer.\n\nMy advice, double-check and triple-check at which station of Amazon you will be working and what it's like to work there.

This makes maintaining a positive face to the associates very stressful.\r\n\r\n-At some sites overtime requirements are ridiculous. However I fortunately was mostly able to avoid that. The shifts can be long however. There was a time that I was consistently working 15 hour days.\r\n\r\n-Managers are scored by their associates based on numerous factors. This can be a good thing, and my scores were always good. However this can be credited to me personally being more people oriented, while some of the more technical managers who contribute just as much to the organization can receive low scores due to their lack of associate face time. The score becomes more problematic once managers become scarce, and hiring increases. This prevents you from being able to realistically do your job of running shift while having meaningful engagements with associates."}, {"review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Catalog Associate, English in Chennai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Office and work stations are amazing", "cons": "Growth is a bit slow in India.
