the company for \"performance management\" and then fires about half of those people.  Amazon believes that if they fire the bottom 5% and hire people \"better than the average person already at the company\" they will always have the best talent. This year they increased the target in most teams to fire 10%. Even on teams who continue to recruit for open positions!\n\nIn practice, the URA target creates a Darwinian culture where people are always scrambling to make sure they're either 1) Best friends with their manager or 2) Better than a couple other people on the team. And sometimes 1) is much easier than working hard for 2)... \n\nBroad power given to managers in performance review process (skip level managers generally trust the information provided by front line managers) reinforce this Darwinian culture. It means that your relationship with your manager is almost *everything* to your survival and success at the company.\n\nIf you're not your manager's MVP, or second most valuable player, you might be their next URA (UnRegretted Attrition) target and you will be looking for a job soon. \n\nIf you're a front-line manager, it is more complicated. Your skip will demand high productivity from the team, for obvious reasons. But your team rates you monthly (\"Overall, how good a job is your manager doing?\"). If your directs rate you poorly, this data can be used to fire you, so, ask too much of them, and you might be out the door. Or they start leaving to other positions - the SDE II role is always in high demand, so it is super easy for SDE II's to leave. Even SDE I's with a year of experience are finding it easy to move within the company. This puts front-line managers in a structurally difficult situation. Unless you're also a good developer and can demonstrate your value that way.\n\nAlways remember that you're just one re-org from having a manager with very different expectations than your current manager.

Second, Amazon doesn't really care about you as a person - only as a productive cog in the machine.  Third, the RSU award program is ok, but total comp is really only great if the stock is climbing 30% a year.  Finally, everyone wants to hire an ex-Amazonian right now.
