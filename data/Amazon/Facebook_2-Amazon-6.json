You have others around you doing the same and other various jobs. You also have a radio you're able to use when you're not sure what to do about something.

For those of you that have ADD/ADHD it is a blessing and a curse. For me personally if I was to sit at a desk all day, and do the same movements at the same pace in the same spot all day everyday. It would not take long for me to go into autopilot, eventually leading to me falling asleep or making a lot of mistakes. No matter what job you get at Amazon you will have to be able to self start and be trusted to go to your breaks and lunch at your specific time (give or take a few minutes) and most importantly COME BACK to your area TO SCAN ANYTHING if your job has anything to do with scanning anything. After your training and waiting weeks are up you will get a .5 - 1.0 point for being late back from a break or lunch. They do have a 3 min grace period. Benefits seem really good, I've never used the health insurance though. Seems good... You have the ability to cross train in other areas. I think for at least the warehouse I work in they are making people cross train as this facility is switching to a return warehouse. The point system has it good sides.

So many issues have been created because of their systems, both on the job and personal life. You can opt in for emails to be sent any time you were given a point, late pass, applied pto, or got approval for ato. That's great. But it's the way you will always get these emails even if the system is wrong and tries to fix it. The AtoZ app shows your points, the day and time you were given a point, why you got it, and it'll tell you to dispute if needed. Be sure you always check your atoz app for this information. I HOPE A LOT OF PEOPLE READ THIS BECAUSE IM ABOUT TO SAVE YOUR BUTTS!!!! PTO is automatically approved. You can be at work and you feel like going home, all you have to do is put in the time you're leaving and what time your shift would've ended had you stayed. Then go clock out. Obviously you should inform your ambassador. Screenshot your confirmed time and hours or minutes from your atoz app. As soon as you click confirm and it shows whatever it shows screenshot it and keep it in a folder on your phone. ATO has to be put in and approved by whoever. Same goes for this. When it is or if its approved, screenshot it. Bc this is an area you can get mix ups in the system. If you're going to be late or take a day off and you want to use your PTO make sure you screenshot your confirmation. I have had it MANY MANY MANY times where I put it in and I'll clock in late, only to see later that they gave me points for it. Sometimes they will STILL take your PTO time !!!! Sometimes they might catch it on their own. But more often than not they wont. Screenshot your point and your PTO and add the screenshot of whatever you used to cover it to start with. Start a case with HR from the app. Check back daily. IF YOU ARE CLOSE TO YOUR LIMIT ON POINTS do not wait. Put in the hr case and then go to the hr desk at lunch or beginning of shift because they could start the process of firing you no matter what it says. But I have had it to where my screenshots didnt matter because their system said it looked fine. When covid started they decided out of the blue on our first day to change the shift by 15 min difference for the start and end . They didnt change everyones in the system so I was getting 2-3 email a day saying I was late, took a early lunch or was back late from it, and that I left early from work. I didnt even notice until I got an email saying I was out of late passes, and ATO, that my points were at 6 already. I was able to fix it but my husband to this very day believes I was getting to work late every night and leaving work early every morning to cheat .
