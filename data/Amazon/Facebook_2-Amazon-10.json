This site doesn't not have second or third beers so u don't get a raise when get more responsibility on if you make it to manager, and most are brought in from other sites on ly one person there was a manger that started as something else. I think he is placeholder to give out hope but they hire college grads who never worked a day in their life. The entire place is truly run by computers. that's your real boss. if there is a problem on the app there is a problem with your job. And, YOU have to go after work on your time to HR for an hour long line to fix it. Not worth the trouble unless your starving or need medical attention. Now I did work there for about year. And left because my body was literally breaking like a machine cause every job is a 1step 2step job meaning u pick up from the right and place on the left. You're a robot. and repetitive motion like that for 10 hrs a day 4days in a row every week for months can break parts of you that were fine before. And no matter what they would not give me another job. So I was out on workers comp which they denied. And refused to change the conditions I went back and the pain happened till I had to go back to the doctor again and waiting for months for them to approve my therapy but they wanted me to return to work first. Not for me. Too much nepotism, not enough professional management. honest there \"manager\" are not Managing anything. I don't think one person has the authority tactually change or do anything to improve the situation outside their own objectives.

Best practices from a centralized corporate lens are not shared with new managers so the ramp up is steep for them. \r\n- Safety leadership obsesses over the smallest detail while leaving mould growing in the water tanks where everyone is supposed to refill their water bottles while in the facility.
