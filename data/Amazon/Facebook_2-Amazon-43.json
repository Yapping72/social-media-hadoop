in Euclid, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay:base pay for everyone is $15 an hour,I received $3 more for nightshift, and they were offering $2 extra during the beginning of covid.3%401k match. Amazon stock purchase option. Always hiring and continue to open new warehouse locations asap. Great place for anyone willing to work and try their best, no experience needed. Many different positions and opportunities to move up and around the facility. May obtain up to 6 points until termination they state but ive received more than 13 from computer errors and maintained employed. Points drop off every 90 days. Receive pto(almost 2 hrs if FT )and pay weekly. Constantly offering overtime and extra pay during certain shifts anywhere from $3 to$5 extra weekly. Free Insurance benefits for all employees starting day 1 just a $1,500 deductible until most services and prescriptions are free. Come prepared to work with a good attitude and make yourself known to others. The .ore people you know the more information you learn and more opportunities open up to broaden your horizon and higher pay typically comes with it. Very flexible scheduling, constantly training and implementing new techniques to make your job easier or safer, definitely implemented a lot of COVID safety measures asap and continuing to add more almost daily it seems(a lot of sanitizers everywhere, disposable masks/gloves, plexiglass dividers for protection, hired over 100 people as safety monitors to remind people to keep 6ft apart and wear masks properly as well as more sanitary employees to double up and keep the facility extra clean and stocked up. New cameras at main security entrance monitoring everyones temperature as they walk into work as well as implementing COVID testing. Paid 2 weeks off if sent home bc of fever. Open to feedback and new ideas, just locate your manager or write on the idea board. Open 24hrs so there's many shifts available for anytime of person, very diverse and fun workplace if you can find the time for it.", "cons": "The facility uses a lot of electronic equipment, computers and robots which leads room for PLENTY errors. Clock in now requires use of location sharing in the amazon employee app which rarely picks up on my exact location stating I wasnt inside the facility so I wasn't able to clock in and constantly having to file time clock errors to correct my punches. Definitely pay attention to your hours worked, time punches and points because they easily get tagged onto you due to the time clock and location services errors. Make sure you punch out at the correct times for breaks or points will get added on and ive even logged into the employee app and was given more than 3 points during 1 shift and I think 5 total out of complete computer error in one work week. Immediately address any issues like this to hr before it gets out of control. Usually a quick fix and hr is on site almost 24hrs except from like 2am to 6am.theres an employee hotline 1800 number that's accessible 24/7 but can be hard to understand and usually can't fix the problem right away typically giving you a claim # and tell you to call back within 24 to 48 hrs to see if they can help. Sometimes hard to understand and don't have the capability to help you as well as the site facility hr personally. 1st month is very hard on the body and surprisingly painful bc of the use of random muscles you don't use at an office desk.The warehouse is the size of multiple Walmarts put together, be prepared for a lot of walking and steps. Once inside you will notice a line of green tape wrapping around the building called the green mile. Sometimes they are always offering so much overtime and extra shifts to pick up, it can be nearly impossible to find a workstation to begin working at or by the time you reach a station given to you by management, another employee had already beat you to it.ike I said its a very large facility with 4 or more floors. Sometimes you might want to arrive early so you can get a station before the rush of employees enter bc it can take up to an hour or more to find an open station finally, so make sure you invest in very good walking shoes bc thats something you will constantly be doing if not standing at your station lifting heavy boxes and climbing step ladders for most associate positions. I definitely felt more like a number than a person who needed to produce the right number or quota hourly which felt almost nearly impossible and management will definitely be right there to remind you every hour or two along with other quality control personnel informing you on every mess up you had made so far that day which half the time is not even you fault, its either the scanner or computer errors you have no control over. Itd great to be informed of mistakes made so you can correct your errors and perform your job better but majority of the time its not something in your control and management is concerned if you know how to do your job correctly and don't listen to you when you try to explain majority of the problems stem from electronicall errors and other things out of your control such as running out of work and people forget about you bc your located at the end of the facility so you have to wait for them to bring you more unless you put on your walking shoes and locate management and inform them or go to the dock and grab your own pallet of totes back to your station wasting a lot of time and energy and doing the work of multiple people for pay that seems great until you realize the amount of work and physical labor you end up doing while doing such a simple job task. I constantly felt like I was walking on eggshells under my management team, which almost sent me through a retraining course bc they didn't think I understood how to do my job that consisted of scanning an item from a tote and placing it on a shelf with different sized openings to store objects of all shapes and sizes. They did not listen to what I had to say. Sometimes you can get a tote full of 200 cell phone cases if you're lucky and friends with the employees who bring the pallets to you, making your quota obtainable for that hour within 10 minutes...but if you only get totes filled with objects the size of a small child, you're lucky to scan in almost 100 items for the hour and thats moving at the speed of light to get that #. Also the facility is so large its almost impossible to leave your station on break because you end up spending majority of your time walking to the bathroom or cafeteria and back and believe me, by break time you will definitely want to sit down as soon as your given the chance. They also monitor your time off task, so if you haven't scanned an item into the system within 5 minutes they start recording how long until another item is scanned in. I dont believe you can get fired over not making quota but you're only alotted 30 minutes a shift of time off task. Sometimes where you're stations located, it can take you 7 minutes just to reach the restroom not to mention using it and walking back another 7 minutes., so my advice is to arrive early to get a station located close to the entrance because the cafeteria and restrooms are right there as well giving u more time to rest on break..unless you're a person who doesn't eat or use the restroom and doesn't sit down\ud83e\udd23 . Permanent employees get mouth swab drug tested during orientation while filling out paperwork and policies and picking up their badges. I was told the company they outsource the test to will call you only 3 times. If you miss the call, you unfortunately miss the job and have to wait 6 or 9 months to reapply. This is the only company who has drug tested me without asking me upfront if I take any prescription medications. Therefore, ive lost the job I applied for twice already because I was never able to get ahold of the testing company to show proof of medication, which was very disappointing. I receive a lot of spam calls daily but I answered as many calls as I could throughout the week and still missed them. I was able to work as a seasonal employee throughout this whole COVID season without being tested until i received a notice that seasonal employees will be ending their positions soon unless we applied to become real employees and once approved for that status we must take the mouth swab drug test which I was told by the quest employee id receive an email or text in the near future with my results and how to proceed from there...well I never received either one of those, took the test on a Sunday evening (beginning day of the workweek) and by Friday I lost access to the employee app, so I had to Google the 1800 hr phone number who then explained I was terminated but didn't have the authority to tell me why and the phone call wait for the representative I needed to speak to was a 3 day wait making it basically impossible to attempt the situation at hand and my facility hr did not have a phone number therefore I couldn't contact them either because my employee badge no longer worked to let me inside the building to speak to hr, my manager or anyone besides a security guard possibly. Oh and don't forget if their isn't a computer tracking your work, theres definitely multiple employees watching over your every move and just in case, there isn't a single spot inside or outside of the warehouse that a camera is covering youre every move besides inside a bathroom stall I would hope..but its understandable considering the amount of employees entering the facility within a days work along with the amount of inventory and its price. It is a very large and profitable company with a lot at stake. The high volume of employees and constant feedback can get overwhelming when working three 12 hour shifts back to back, you definitely need the 4 days off afterwards to recoup unless your a real people person who's constantly on. Your mainly at a station about 6 ft from the next, so you rarely get a chance to socialize plus its very loud. On top of that, you rarely see the same people twice because you either work different shifts or get placed on a different floor so its rare to feel included, like you're part of a group or something. Which doesn't give you much to look forward to at times when going to work. The main human contact is management pointing out every flaw and quality control coming around every so often informing you of another mistake and how to go about it next time around...no cell phones or earbuds aloud and don't get caught by upper management returning from their paid COVID leave bc thats instant termination."}, {"review_title": "Hard work rewarded", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Senior Program Manager in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Compensation is solid, with hard work being rewarded", "cons": "Work life balance not always the best"}], [{"review_title": "The Amazon Experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 May 2021", "job_title": "Whole Foods Shopper in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Full schedule, customer service, methodical approach to doing job", "cons": "Full-time opportunities only at select locations"}, {"review_title": "good but stressful", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Trainer in Bristol, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay, quick paced environment with new projects always on the move", "cons": "high workload, under staffing in support functions"}, {"review_title": "Great people to work with", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Retail Sales Associate in Alicante", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Calm environment and steady flow of customers", "cons": "Not a lot of variety in daily duties"}, {"review_title": "Amazon job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 May 2021", "job_title": "Risk Manager in San Jose, San Jose", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "its an entrataining and customer obsessed company", "cons": "I dont have any to think of"}, {"review_title": "good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 May 2021", "job_title": "Associate in Burnaby, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "excellent management, good pay, safety is on prior", "cons": "little hard, long shift, tiring"}, {"review_title": "IDK", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 May 2021", "job_title": "Package Handler in La Vergne, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay was ok but could be much better", "cons": "Location is not good for people outside the wire"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 May 2021", "job_title": "Customer Service Associate in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good company and no issues at all", "cons": "No cons at all ,the company is perfect"}, {"review_title": "-", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 May 2021", "job_title": "Trms in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work is peaceful.\r\nMore opportunities to upgrade skills.", "cons": "Growth is very slow as there's huge competition."}, {"review_title": "Receiving", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 May 2021", "job_title": "Area Manager in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits\r\nOkay Pay\r\n3 day weekends\r\nGreat Culture", "cons": "12 hour days\r\nPay can be better for hours \r\nDrama"}, {"review_title": "Overall recommended", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 May 2021", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer in Shanghai, Shanghai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "WLB compared with other company in China", "cons": "No core business in China area"}], [{"review_title": "Really harder work than you would think", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jan 2021", "job_title": "CSA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Health benefits if you manage to achieve the subscription from a different city than Bogot\u00e1", "cons": "Not enough time of training and no further assistance after on-boarding, you are on your own on a really stressful job."}, {"review_title": "Accounts receiveables collections process", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Financial Analyst in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazon company is too good.", "cons": "Management is not good.
