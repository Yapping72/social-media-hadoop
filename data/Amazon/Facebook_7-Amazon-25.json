Amazon allows almost unlimited creativity for those that like to think big and then drive to completion.

Experience gained and networking acquired across multiple teams and organizations is determined by your own cadence however these open up unlimited and massive opportunities in the company YoY.", "cons": "Very hard to maintain work life balance. You will generally work a level up while getting payed a level down at amazon. Getting promoted is largely determined by continuously proving your case that you are succeeding at current level, writing your own promo docs (even though your boss is supposed to to that). Burnout is real and will happen faster than other companies. Working for amazon is alot like PBR, just have to hold on for 8 seconds and you can win the rodeo but you can also end up with damaged social life/WLB/relationships outside of work. It maybe worth it, but you have to be consciously assessing mental health and checking for burnout. Many people roll into December with full vacation/PTO becuase there is never a good time to take off. Growing a career at amazon maybe a good flavor of life to choose for someone as it provides opportunity for all as long as you deliver results. Overall I would recommend for someone looking to grow and promote fast at a tech company but those that value life outside work should look elsewhere. Amazon is getting big and slow, if you have the ability to drive with agility and flexibility you will be more successful than your peers and get more results. At Amazon you need to get used to driving programs with little to no support, and doing the job of 3-4 people. Amazon mentorship program exists but it is weak, Mentorship program at amazon could become a huge strength for the company if it had more support behind it. The constant turnover of business/tech/operation teams is almost unbelievable, and is slowing many large scale programs and initiatives. Amazon needs to solve the continuous attrition of good workers getting burned out/under-payed/over worked, or at least slow it to a reasonable level. Right now the attrition at the company makes it difficult for teams to move forward when all employees for a given team turn over in 6-12 months, leaving few to no SME for respective fields. Amazon needs to cultivate talent and turn those new hires and transfers into the next generation of leaders and executives rather than continue suffering the same fate year after year as the talent base runs away."}, {"review_title": "Low pay for hours", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Milwaukee, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits, able to train for other positions", "cons": "Work you to many hours at a low pay rate"}], [{"review_title": "Working as Amazon delivery driver in BC", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Delivery Driver in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours and days of work during the week", "cons": "Long time driving in traffic"}, {"review_title": "great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Risk Specialist in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good company to work as company", "cons": "nothing to give any cons"}, {"review_title": "Not bad", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Software Developer in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "salary paid is very good", "cons": "work life balance is bad.
