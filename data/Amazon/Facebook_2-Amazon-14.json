Amazon has a very unique and strong culture where it's Leadership Principles guide day-to-day decision making in a highly visible way. Amazonians hold a high performance bar for each other and are encouraged to Think Big and take calculated risks. Working at Amazon is unique in that any manager regardless of leveling can make case for a new idea and if compelling in their argument, they will be supported to pursue the idea. Amazonians Dive Deep into data to identify insights and inform go-forward strategies. Amazon give it's employees the opportunity to do their best work while positively impacting the lives of millions of customers.

To maintain pace with the performance bar while supporting a load of weekly/monthly/quarterly deep dive business reviews, annual planning (ongoing for half the year), team development, strategic thinking and doc writing, (for most) requires working consistently through nights and weekends. Promotions at Amazon tend to occur 12-18 months after an employee has been operating at the next level and the process is equally as rigorous and challenging as getting hired. The company currency is the written narrative (6 pagers), be it a business review, new product idea or 3-year plan. These reviews can be anything but warm and fuzzy, one must have thick skin and high emotional intelligence to take criticism, which is widely constructive but can at times become demoralizing. Bottom line, Amazon isn\u2019t for everyone and the pace and high expectations can lead to burnout; but if you have the stamina, customer passion, analytical horsepower and thick skin, it\u2019s one of the best places to be to do your best work with some of the brightest minds you\u2019ll meet."}, {"review_title": "Great Company to Work at", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Sr. Business Manager in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Ability to work with an entrepreneurial mindset.

Colleagues across departments in AWS are friendly and always willing to spend time with you, and I've been shocked at how well my team respects work/life balance and schedules especially in working with colleagues globally across different time zones.

My department put a no-meeting Friday policy in place, and the team typically rarely asks folks to turn on video unless they are presenting which does make a remote day to day more manageable.
