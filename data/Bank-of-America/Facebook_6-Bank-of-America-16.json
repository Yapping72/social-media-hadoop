The problem is that 100 people are competing to be promoted into 1 spot that opens every 3 months. The term revolving door does not even begin to describe this place. (Almost) everyone wants to leave. \r\n\r\nAbsolutely terrible compensation. They continually dangle the carrot in front of you with the prospect of future salary and bonus increases. The compensation system is borderline criminal. You receive credit on paper for about 50% of the work that you do, and you will need to \"challenge\" for the rest. Challenging involves proving to someone in the back office that you should have been awarded credit but were not. Challenges are often rejected. \r\n\r\nThe position has transitioned into a customer service role similar to the call centers at Comcast. Morale is low and the environment is toxic. Bonuses continuously declining with a $39,995 base salary. Many employees are part time Uber drivers. Upward mobility within Merrill Edge is non-existent, and if you think that this is a back door and that you are going to go to another part of the company, good luck. Many of the positive reviews on Glassdoor are written by Bank of America recruiters.

I came fully licenses with a CFP and almost a decade of experience.  People with far less experience were hired directly into the higher positions I thought I would work in.  Management assured me that it would only be a few months before I moved up.\r\n\r\nWhat happened instead was that the compliance team waited months before submitting my license to FINRA.  I basically worked all a call center appointment maker for the first year.  I made exactly half of what I was told my first year salary would be.  I did move up quickly once I was finally licensed.\r\n\r\nMy next role was working until 11 PM every night (1 AM EST).  Since there were no leads for over half the shift, management expected the team, as salaried employees, to work 10-13 hour shift.  Several lawsuits came from this.  I finally got into a role that was a better fit for me, and remained a top performer in my position for the remainder of my time.\r\n\r\nI was quickly disillusioned.  Under the suitability standard the company followed, my role was to generate unnecessary commissions when a client rolled out of their 401k.  I was never paid on commission, but my managers compensation was directly related to it.  \r\n\r\nThat was probably a large part of why I had 12 sales managers in three years.  Most of them were fairly incompetent and lacked skill.  I had caught many future managers with the firm manipulating compensation and cheating clients.  I even my reported my direct to HR, something that I have never done in 20 years of working.  Other managers would openly scream and threaten my co-workers.\r\n\r\nI decided to take a longer paternity leave prior to my son being born. I told a co-worker that I was looking elsewhere and may leave after the time off.  I had already met large sales quotas for my coming month.  After taking a vacation, I returned to work to find out this friend had been promoted to my manager.\r\n\r\nI called a few weeks later to start the paperwork.  I was informed I needed to wait two more weeks to start the process.  I let my manager know this.  I was terminated with cause the following week.  My reason for termination was stated as an issue with trading.  This was in spite of the current manager, and two prior managers, reviewing the trade issue and informing me they found no fault with my business practices.\r\n\r\nThe negative U5 meant I found it difficult to work elsewhere in the industry.  I decided to go independent, as I never wanted to deal with the sales practices the big bank forced on employees.  My compliance team reached out with concern over the U5 report.  Not because what it stated, but because they discovered that Merrill Edge was using the same canned terminology to terminate employees.\r\n\r\nI was put in contact with a former FINRA lawyer and discussed the dismissal.  I was informed that, in 20 years of working in the industry, neither the lawyer nor my compliance team had ever seen two U5 terminations read exactly the same.  This was a first, and there were several others just like me... including one other who was also terminated prior to setting up his paternity leave.\r\n\r\nI would carefully consider any offer working with this firm.

First, just think about it logically, this is a big company, they deal with high turnover just like any other big corporation, even though they are one of the most well known companies in Jax and offer many job opportunities, this isn't going to be the greatest place to work for, just like McDonalds doesn't have the best hamburger in town. \n\nIf you work here, the average employee will have to put up with office politics, unfair commission structure, crappy systems, inefficient policies, bs managers, etc. If you are only concerned with making money in your life, then by all means, this isn't a bad place to work. You can make good money, depending on your role or how many hours you want to put in you can make six figures a year. Remember though that every position with the exception of a very few, which mostly goes to females, like training mentors or compliance personnel, you will be working on the phones. Not only are they call center jobs, they'll also be some sort of sales job. There's high stress and expectations for you to hit their metrics no matter what, even if your opportunities have dwindled due to market or changes within the company. They have no sympathy if you are having difficulty meeting metrics due to sudden changes. You will feel like a number who is easily expendable because they are a big company, they'll just find another peon to replace you. Since this is a large company, managers will telll you how to do something one way and after following those instructions for over a year, you'll get a new manager and then criticize you for it and say you should have done it a different way. There's always a lot to be desired.\n\nSome of my biggest sticking points in my experience was the fact that you are nitpicked for any little thing you say since every phone call is recorded and part of your performance is graded on it and how little any employee development there is. There's a million things in the investment world to know about, but often times you get these one off situations that don't relate to your day to day typical phone call and if you aren't knowledgeable about it when you get that one client who asks about it, your manager will say your not ready for a promotion even if you do everything else you're asked of. \n\nManagers can and will take advantage of tenured reps because if they just hired newbies to the role you are in and you are tenured, they'll prevent you from being promoted so half their paycheck isn't dependent on the performance from newbies. Also, the managers will make up stupid reasons to hold you back from a promotion when you ask for one when they need you to stay in your current role because of upcoming changes within the company but aren't prepared to tell anyone yet. \n\nOne more was is that one of the biggest commission payouts is based on retention of clients in your books, if you killed it in the day to day aspects of your job, opening new accounts, bringing in new money to the firm, selling clients on investment plans, but too many clients closed their accounts because they are unhappy with the company or need to take out the money for whatever debt they owe, you could receive a very low bonus because the other metrics don't carry as much weight despite those being why you come to work each day and you have very little control on the retention aspect."}, {"review_title": "administrative assistant", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great place to work, good benefits, feel appreciated, opportunity to learn and grow in the field.

Rich area, poor area, high or low traffic center. What?\n\nVery little of your pay comes from actual investment activities. The only things you gey paid on are \"funded accounts,\" \"new money,\" and \"referrals.\"\n\nA funded account is when you open an investment account and the customer funds it with a certain minimum amount. For these, you barely get paid anything at all.  It is also difficult to get them opened through compliance, to call different departments to \"link\" accounts, and actually put money in the account.\n\nNew money pays the most but is the hardest to get.  It does not matter how much money you get invested unless it comes from another company.  BUT gathering more money from another company does not \"trigger\" new money credit unless a new bank or investment account is opened. So if someone comes in with a large check but doesn't feel like opening accounts, even if you convinced them to bring that money, you get paid nothing. \n\nFurthermore, you dont get credit for money deposits for 8 weeks from the date they arrive. So if they remove it in the next two months you lose get nothing. Then your bonus comes a month and a half after the quarter ends. So in many cases you dont see the fruits of your labor for about half a year after you make a sale. How is yhat for motivation? Positive reinforcement should be as close to immediate as possible in order to be effective.\n\nAlso, if you miss the minimum threshold for new money, you get paid zero for the quarter.  So you can bring in millions of dollars in a year and not get paid a bonus at all. Remember, new money is the only metric that pays a substantial amount.\n\nReferrals are for small business and home loans.  But the advisor is restricted from opening and mostly servicing small business accounts.  How does that make any sense? Home loans pay a flat new money amount when they close, but that completely depends on your mortgage officer. If he is like mine, you can send 15 referrals and none close. So get paid zero compensation there too.\n\nQuality referrals to WEALTH MANAGEMENT for clients over 250k do not pay you. Only if and when the business closes. Again a huge chunk of your esrning potwntiak in the hands of others.\n\nIn most scenarios, the tracking system will refuse to pick up credit for your work and you have to \"challenge\" for your compensation  then they will use obscure tactics from the 90 page comp plan,  which is updated frequently and without notice, to deny you credit.\n\nOne more thing the so calles management is a joke.  They get on these conference calls and talk like they know it all and are better than you. Well, i use brokercheck when i see you start talking. Most of these managers had their series 7 and 66 for one or two years before taking the series 9 and 10 and becoming managers. Some have disclosures such as a bankruptcy in their record and manage a team of financial advisors. Completely unqualified.  They do not promote based on merit.

This accusation technique was so brutal it triggered psychological ruminating over the matter. \r\n\r\nMy card swipe records and CCTV showed that there was there was zero basis for this allegation, and I had bumped in to the employee on my regular route to work, using the lifts I always used. The false accuser had lied saying she only ever saw me use a different set of lifts.\r\n\r\nHR then called me back, told me that they had seen CCTV, written a \"report\" on the matter, and would update the false accuser. When I complained\r\nthat I suspected that the false accuser was spreading rumours in the office I was made to feel that it was my imagination. HR lied about issuing a  \"report\", what they actually created was a wishy washy letter which referred to \"general interaction\" and totally hid the false accusation.\r\n\r\nI had to continue to work in the vicinity of the false accuser, regularly crossing paths with her, and having to put up with multiple people in the\r\noffice making funny faces at me. I then told the false accuser that I had not deliberately waited for her by the lifts and apologised if I had\r\ninadvertently scared her. For this action HR launched a formal disciplinary against me.\r\n\r\nI was then subject to horrendous bullying, humiliation, lying and shouting in a two against one session. There was a clear attempt to get me to make\r\nfalse statements conducive to covering up HR failures and to prevent me from making my case. There was an attempt to browbeat me to to accept that\r\nthey did not know I had not followed the false accuser even though HR had previously claimed to have viewed CCTV video. The CCTV still images were right\r\nin front of them as it was aggressively claimed that nobody would acknowledge I did not follow the false accuser.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent carefully massaged outcome was deeply biased, misleading and fraudulent. It hid the fact I had complained of the false accuser\r\nspreading rumours. It hid the fact I had been told HR would update the false accuser but had not. It hid the fact that I had requested explicit acknowledgement of the false accusation. It hid the fact that during the hearing I had requested multiple times for the false accuser to be presented with the CCTV evidence and my swipe records.\r\n\r\nHR misbehaviour continued with me being told not to bother appealing and that the appeal manager may investigate me for \"sexual harrassment\" (a totally\r\nmade accusation by HR designed to put me off appealing).\r\n\r\nI did appeal. The appeal outcome does note that I requested the false accuser to be updated but say it was is not \"normal\" to do so and provides no futher details. The appeal manager did agree to tell the false accuser to stop spreading rumours.\r\nThey used euphemisms such as \"high level\" and \"trying to summarise\" in a pathetic attempt to justify why prior documentation had what I would describe as\r\nmajor fraudulent ommissions. \r\n\r\nThe firm refused to acknowledge I had been subject to bullying and kept trying to fob me off. The hearing was recorded and the audio would be strong evidence of bullying. When I asked HR to listen to the audio they claimed it had been deleted.\r\n\r\nAfter the appeal, HR agreed to tell the false accuser the truth and this time I got it written on email they they actually did it. \r\n\r\nHowever, I could not trust HR that they actually did update the false accuser (even though I now had it in writing on an email) as they had spent 6+ months lying, bulling and stone walling the matter. I found a new job, resigned, and emailed the false accuser directly with attachments of my swipe entry records, \r\nCCTV still images and described how HR through deliberate inaction had sought to hide the truth from her."}, {"review_title": "Customer service representative", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits are good, HR team is amazing & extremely cooperating and they are honestly more sensible than the managers.", "cons": "No growth, Poor management, unreasonable targets, too Monotonous, no life work Balance, managers do not have managing experience not education required to manage a team they certainly lack the judgement capacity.( Chandler branch)"}, {"review_title": "Downsize every 2 weeks!", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "10 Sept 2019", "job_title": "Mortgage Servicing Specialist in Plano, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits are great and may the only reason you stay if you have a family.", "cons": "Culture is not for the employees and paid is subpar.

Tuition reimbursement that nobody ever uses. Paid sick days", "cons": "DO NOT apply for this position if you are a college graduate. I don\u2019t even know why would the job posting asks for college degree. This job can be easily performed without high education as it is basic. Just to give you an insight, this position is no longer what it used to be. \r\n\r\nWhen you have your interview they will say that you\u2019ll be a banker with sales goals and that at times when line gets busy, you will have to assist the tellers as well. They will say that when you are at the teller line you are supposed to uncover customers needs and see if you take sales opportunities to fulfill them at your desk. \r\n\r\nThis IS NOT really what the role is at the moment, things are changing and the bank is getting rid of tellers to eventually have them trained so they become relationship bankers. \r\n\r\nFull time tellers will disappear!!!. They also want to have a single teller eventually or two relationship bankers that can do both jobs. \r\n\r\nSo with that being said, this is  basically a full time teller position except you will be given 5 times more tasks and way more responsibilities than the teller position ( called customer service representative which still exists) \r\n\r\nThe tellers  are currently  paid 20 dollars an hour and they want to pay relationship bankers the same even though you will be doing so much more. \r\n\r\nManagement is based on sales but you can\u2019t barely get sales because full time tellers are going away so that leaves you being a cash handling associate. Having two or more relationship bankers instead of plain tellers is only convenient for the bank and their budget, not for the employee. So if you have a college degree, listen to my advice and take your skills and education somewhere else. This job is basic and no college graduate should be wasting their time being a teller. On the other hand, if your education is high school only and you still decide to apply, I would suggest you negotiate the pay rate and not let managers get away with it. \r\n\r\nThey will try to underpay you and other future candidates if you accept this job for 20 an hour so please do everybody a favor and do not accept less than 24 dollars for this position if you still want to apply. I\u2019m being straight up here when I say you will not only do transactions but also work at the desk when they need you, complete end of day reports, they will ask you to work when you are sick and you\u2019ll do most of the tasks an assistant manager does but underpaid. \r\n\r\nThey don\u2019t want you to have overtime so your hourly rate is what you are getting. \r\nThey will tell you that you\u2019ll get money from bonuses but that\u2019s unrealistic considering the fact that you have to be a teller most of you shift and so do the other relationship bankers that way none of you will make your goals ( they do this to cut expenses and not pay bonuses) They will rush you and overwork you all the time so take my advice and go to a company that can afford you or if you still want to work here don\u2019t settle for less than 24 hour. Pay increases over the years are minimum to non existent and they won\u2019t even consider you no matter how good you are at your job, you are just an average employee to their eyes, no raise whatsoever."}, {"review_title": "Investment Banking - Foreign Exchange and Money Markets", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "28 Mar 2020", "job_title": "Senior Team Member in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "this is my first job I have learned in and out about investment banking division and I am very thankful to bank of America and I had a great experiences at this bank.", "cons": "no night allowances for the employees apart from that I feel very great for working bank of America"}, {"review_title": "A great place to work, but choose your career path wisely", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Aug 2008", "job_title": "Regional Sales Manager in Hillsboro, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, including a pension plan.", "cons": "Too many people in management and not enough people that have authority to make decisions without having to get approval from someone else who in turn has to get approval from someone else."}, {"review_title": "Decent firm poorly led", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 Oct 2008", "job_title": "Vice President in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They offer a great benefits package (including extensive paternity leave) and decent salary.\r\nMany are great co-workers, though teamwork is not a strength of the firm.", "cons": "Management is horrible  - no communication, they take arbitrary and conflicting decisions, go back-and-forth regarding the strategy for I-Banking.
