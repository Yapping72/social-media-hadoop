They make promises they don't keep. Most have their heads in the clouds regarding how much Relationship Managers can actually perform. So goals can be a little ridiculous. \r\nBonuses are horrible, performing at 110% can barely get you around $950 in bonuses FOR THE ENTIRE QUARTER. Also, that depends on location and that is considering my location had decently higher volume. On top of that they find ways to take pieces of that away left and right saying \"your center didn't perform here or there\". Not to mention bonuses are already taxed at such a high rate in California. You end up getting almost no bonus at all in most cases despite doing well. (I've hit 135% + of monthly goals). Most other sales jobs in the area would give you a much better bonus and about as much pay. Most long time employees say the position used to pay much more.\r\nThey seem to be slowing progression as well. They threw \"Senior Relationship Manager\" between Relationship Manager and Financial Solutions Advisor. It's basically an inbetween job where you get licensed (series 7 etc) but they won't let you do anything with it. (Pointless...) \r\nIf you are working in retail or some other part of the bank there is no pathway to maybe transfer to a diffent side. For example a young recent graduate transfering from retail banking to having a career they actually studied for in investment or corporate banking.

BAML outside the USA is a bit different from other US banks. Instead of looking to increase their share of foreign business, BAML is really just looking to facilitate business with their US clientele. This means that they really aren't interested in growing their Asian business. headcount in the region has largely been decreasing and much of the work done in the region is actually meant to find ways to automate roles. \r\n- Work-Life - It is a US Bank in Asia which means that depending on your role, you will probably be doing 1-4 late night conference calls a week. I regularly did 10-12 hour days. Many other people did much worse. \r\n- Senior Management - Though it seems like there is a lot of change in the financial industry of late, senior management doesn't seem to have changed at all. It just felt like an old boy's club (and I am a man myself) with massive amounts of politics and huge quantities of wasted efforts just to keep senior leaders happy. I acknowledge that part of a person's job is to help make their senior leader look good, but it just felt like we were spending too much of our time doing this so that he could keep his comfortable role. \r\n- Culture and values - Sure, BAML has them, but I just don't think senior leadership even bothers to pretend like they live them. Apart from mandatory training, which is largely lost on most people, the values seem largely uncommunicated. \r\n\r\nCompensation and Benefits - this is probably the one bright spot (and probably the only reason people actually work here). I felt the pay and benefits were quite good. \r\n\r\nOverall - If you need a job that pays a salary, work here.

Vacation is pretty skimpy--only 2 weeks for tellers w/ less than 5 yrs at the bank. They just cut out our bonuses, so tellers now get no cash bonuses.Management is always shifting priorities. They go overboard focusing on whatever new priority they have, and lose sight of everything else. For example, right now we have a long, elaborate greeting we have to do, and you'd better get it right if you're visited by a secret shopper. In a couple months they'll change their focus again & forget all about the silly greeting. Training is HORRIBLE. If you haven't worked as a teller before, you'd better be ready to fight to get sufficient training. My #1 piece of advice if you get hired: do not just let them throw you out there.

After acquiring very Merrill & Countrywide, the friendly \"let's help each other learn and grow to reach higher standards together\" bank culture has been replaced with a \"throw people under the bus\" and \"get ahead by any means, including making snap business decisions without considering consequences\" culture.  The company doesn't care as much for it's associates as they used to. The atmosphere is highly political, much more so than it was in the past.\r\n- The company is VERY disorganized and lacks in an integrated communication strategy even within individual business units.  The right hand never knows what the left hand is doing, even within peer teams.  We spend a lot of time fixing problems that we create internally (many due to poor decisions, or lack of communication).\r\n- Company is too big, too complex, and extremely hard to navigate.  There are many convoluted processes in place (like internal recruiting, compensation, & promotions) that the average associate does not understand.  Like wise, the company is so big that it's very hard to know what's what organizationally & who's who, even within the smaller business units. \r\n- Company does not require formal training for managers.  Likewise, most associates are only required to take annual compliance training, but no formal on the job training. This often leads to entire teams not knowing/understanding and underperforming in their function within the process.  A lot of associates and managers are set up for failure if they are not savvy enough to just \"figure it out\".\r\n- Compensation/Promotions: The \"lucky\" associates that have the opportunity to work for great leaders may be fortunate enough to be paid in the appropriate range and recieve promotions based on capabilities and value add/leadership potential to the company.  THIS VERY RARELY HAPPENS. More often then not, associates do not get timely promotions or raises. The associates who \"play the game\", but may do less or lower quality work will be be paid more than the guy who's really performing.  Furthermore, all performance evaluations & rate increases, etc. are subjective based on the immediate manager.  There is no consistency in how associates are rated, which leaves a lot of room for favoritism.\r\n- The company overall has certain values and advocates specific things like (inclusive meritocrazy, and flexible work schedules) but all that depends on the immediate manager. If an associates immediate manager does not advocate the companies values, than the associate is out of luck.  Likewise, there is no associate support to protect from bad/poor management. If an associate is dealing with an unfair manager, he/she has no true recourse of action (other than to call the internal HR Advice & Counsel hotline, which means nothing because all they will do is document for a case against the associate if the problem continues to compound)."}, {"review_title": "Lots of room to move up, great employee benefits, pay isn't quite where it should be.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Jan 2013", "job_title": "Senior Operations Analyst in Plano, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "BAC has great health and dental benefits.\r\nBAC has an employee assistance program which helps you financially if you need it and qualify.\r\nBAC has a child care reimbursement program which helps make childcare affordable.", "cons": "I make a few dollars less an hour than similar positions in other mortgage companies are paid.

It's been two years and not one of the college grads in the department has been considered for advancement, only lateral moves to other \"phone\" jobs. \r\n\r\nManagement is not knowledgeable about the departments they manage and managers are switched out constantly. Most managers in my department have never worked the job, therefore they are unable to provide support when needed. They seem to be there only to ensure you are adhering to your schedule and enforce policies. I have had 5 managers in 2 years. By time one catches up with my reviews they get replaced by someone else. \r\n\r\nIn the case of phone based jobs - you are literally tied to a desk. You may not leave the phone without manager approval or scheduled times (which may be up to 4 hours apart). No off-phone time to review email communications (policy changes, etc.), so it can be difficult to keep abreast of important information. Nearly zero interaction with anyone face-to-face. No flexibility in scheduling and most schedules are late morning to evening and included weekend days, meaning it's nearly impossible to further education. Incentive is paid for above expectations performers, but failure to reach incentive goals results in reprimand. Those who perform as 'average\" should be coached and encouraged rather than punished by poor reviews. Those who don't excel in all areas aren't recognized for their hard work.\r\n\r\nSick time computation (which may vary by department) is complicated and difficult to adhere to. You are given 80 hours per year sick time, but each absence is an \"occurrence\". Occurrences are computing on a 12 month rolling calendar and at your 5th occurrence you are on \"warning\", therefore you can have plenty of hours of sick time available this year, but be unable to use it without reprimand because of an absence last year. For people with kids or who had a period of medical issue in the past, this can lead to a perpetual cycle of being reprimanded for each absence (up to threat of termination), even when those absences are few and far between at that point. \r\n\r\nStress levels are high, incredibly so considering the job is phone based. The problem is not the customers (they can be rather frustrating, but not the primary source of stress). The stress comes from all the things listed above. Between the crazy sick-time policy and the stress, half of my dozen person team is currently on med leave.

Many employees have been there for 10-30 years and do not want to train new employees due to fear of being overshadowed or passed over for a promotion.

Her best friend has been employed in that position for almost two years and is still not retaining information thus far. I basically had to train myself for the time I was there. When I asked questions I was oftentimes ignored and/or forgotten. When I suggested getting help from other teammates who seemed to have a grasp on the information also, it was frowned upon. This puts you in a compromising situation because now you\u2019re neglected from being trained and can\u2019t reach out to other sources for help. Workload was extremely behind and no one really wanted to help. Grunt work was oftentimes put off on \u201cthe not so favorites\u201d.

I was surprised to learn the children did not know how the different parts of the town functioned and enjoyed explaining it. \r\n\r\nThe training, though mostly on line is very good as you can go through the material at your own pace and it does depend on workflow, but there is required and then elective training. There are no credits earned, but you learn the material rather than just sitting through a conference. \r\n\r\nI also LOVE that they celebrate the Holidays every year in some way even on a small budget, so we all felt happy and warm and together.

Bank of America will train you how to speak to clients, how to handle difficult situations, and how to work with a sense of urgency. It's a great part-time job during college/school to help build your resume. If you're looking for a long-term goal here, there are a lot of opportunities given the several different locations/branches (but don't think a promotion will just be 'handed' to you). You need to have the right work ethic and attitude. It's also a great way to network. I used to love talking to my customers on a daily basis. Some will keep in touch long after you leave. \r\n\r\nQuite honestly, the work is easy. It's 'retail' banking. Do your job and you'll be fine. \r\n\r\nPart-time and full-time employees receive benefits. Vacation, sick days, jury duty, 401K, medical/dental/vision, tuition reimbursement, childcare reimbursement, paid leave, etc.", "cons": "Low pay. Bank of America will pay you a much lower hourly rate than other banks in the area. I still have several contacts that work for the company, and in 2012 in Los Angeles, they were starting off tellers around $11-$12/hour. I started with the company in 2007, and started at $10.00/hour (or it could have been $9.75\u2026?). In 2009, I left making $11.00/hour as a Senior Teller. I was often tempted to go to Wells Fargo, Chase, or even smaller credit unions, where they offered $2.00-$3.00/hour more, but chose to stay with Bank of America because I knew it would only be temporary until college graduation.\r\n\r\nOffice politics will drive you crazy. It's easy to be recognized in the branch level (recognition is often based on your performance - referrals, sales, customer service), but to be recognized by upper management above the branch level is difficult (and they're the ones that control the promotions). You need to suck up to move up. As always, it depends on your branch and market. I worked in Southern California and found that the particular market manager I had was notorious for favoritism, and only promoting employees she liked on a personal level. Sometimes you need to wait it out. There are constant changes with management, branch and upper-level, and if a great manager ends up at your branch or market, you may find yourself with a great opportunity. I know people who have moved up from a part-time teller to manager in a little over a year. Some people stay tellers for years. \r\n\r\nHowever, it's not always based on management. It has a lot to do with your attitude and your work ethic. A lot of the tellers, personal bankers, and even supervisors were incompetent. They would leave their stations and wander around because they didn't want to help customers (basically, they didn't want to work). Many didn't know how to deal with customers during a difficult situation (what I like to call the blank stare), and many didn't want to go above and beyond for their branch. Call me sensitive, but I saw my branch as my team, and I would help whoever I could if they needed help. Unfortunately, a lot of employees will not have your back here. They'll complain about the smallest things like taking a later lunch, not being able to sit, not wanting to help customers after 6:00PM, emptying the trash, etc. There's also constant office gossip. Employees befriend in cliques. Your best advice is not to get involved, it's not worth the petty drama. \r\n\r\nSometimes you can't blame them though.

This led to dozens of issues including various interpretations of banking laws and regulations: one manager would basically enforce it as \"A\" while your own would enforce it as \"B\" causing major impacts on quality as well as producing very confused customers.\r\n\r\n~Aside from specific incidences regarding banking laws, this also caused major issues among teams on the floor.  My manager, specifically, interpreted each site rule per verbatim: ie, no pens or paper, no food, no decorations, no personal items, etc while the manager sitting five feet across, couldn't care less.  While this may seem trivial, our small team would sit in blank cubicles, no holiday decor, etc while the folks immediately in back of us, were decked out with holiday lights, magazines, treats and so forth.  Yes, we are certainly there to work but considering the nature of the job (non-stop calls), any small activity or perk makes a huge difference in our day.  This was depressing to say the least.\r\n\r\n~  No assigned seating or desks.  Placement was a free for all and those of us working later in the day usually found ourselves sitting alone and away from our teams.\r\n\r\n~ Ridiculous rules.  Overall, each day seemed more like an adult day care than a financial institution.  The East Providence call center specifically, had a \"paperless\" policy meaning no pens, no paper, magazines, etc were allowed on the floor.  Again, considering the lack of consistency among management and the monotonous tendencies of the job, this made working ever so much more difficult to focus on.  Employee satisfaction can make a huge difference in the quality of one's work & I suspect the ridiculous turn over of employees is possibly related to this.\r\n\r\n~  Very strict attendance, PTO and sick day policies.  Regardless of the reason why, all PTO (vacation) & sick time needed to be approved well in advance.  As opposed to scheduling things based on your site or team, this was based on the company as a whole making time off for doctor's appointments, family emergencies or general illnesses, close to impossible.  Typically the only options would be to call out, receive an occurrence or use VTO if available (unpaid).  Unlike many of the other companies I've worked for, they also had an extreme no tolerance policy on weather related absences.  During the Warwick floods or the serious blizzards we experienced back in 2009/2010, we were expected to be there and if not, were automatically given an occurrence.  Sadly, again, due to inconsistencies among managers, some were given less of a reprimand than others for the same instances.  Additionally, this created an endless cycle of very ill employees reporting to work: on more than one occasion people on my team would come in with stomach viruses, vomit in their waste baskets and stay for the remainder of their shift infecting everyone around them (again, no assigned seating).  Once on a warning, the employee would forfeit their incentive bonuses and any hope to apply to other departments regardless of their stats.\r\n\r\n~  The customer survey system was greatly flawed.  Although in my particular case, I was consistently among the top of my peers, every so often I'd receive a customer e-mail survey that clearly was not for me (ie, a call I transferred to another department, customer was not satisfied with the second individual they spoke to and would fill out the survey for that person instead of the CSR).  Even in situations where the survey was very obviously not for the employee (ie, customer referring to the opposite gender, specifically stating the call was regarding a mortgage or something we do not handle as well as other very obvious identifiers), managers would refuse to remove any survey score unless the customer identified the rep by his or her name.  Which never happened.  Sadly this very small incident could be the difference between the much needed bonus or nothing at all.\r\n\r\n~  Scheduling was completely outsourced quite frankly, to India.  If your shift started at 7:50am and you needed to call out, this would create an issue: they weren't open until 8am and you're required to call out at least an hour in advance.  Due to the serious language boundary, there were also major issues where employees would call to find out if a shift change was approved or to call out only to be given incorrect information.  (I winded up receiving a warning at one point due to what appeared to be a \"no call, no show.\"  I had called out, followed procedure only to later, be told I had not called.

Anytime a position opens, the hiring managers expect a lot of effort on your part (i.e. coming in multiple times on your off days or lunch breaks to learn more) well before the job posting to demonstrate interest. Unfortunately, the different job functions aren't clear and often times you don't know a job exists until its posted.

Also, not being located in the main locations (DE or Charlotte) makes the growth opportunities even more limited. \r\n\r\nThey expect quite a bit of effort for a very small increase in pay. They are quite skimpy with increases, it's taken me 5 years to get to making $30k base salary, and the only way to make more money is to really just move up in the company. If you have the opportunity to get a bonus each month, when they determine your yearly raise, they take how much you earned in bonues and add it to your yearly and consider that in how much they will give you in a base salary increase. If you are doing well on bonuses, you are probably not going to get the biggest increase, but in the end you make more money anyway with bonuses if you perform well. \r\n\r\nVery few people in my location have a M-F schedule and many work 2nd or 3rd shifts.
