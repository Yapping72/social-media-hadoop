For the first twelve months of your contract you receive a very fair base salary. During this time the expectation is that you will learn the B of A systems, processes, and underwriting guidelines; establish strong, mutually beneficial relationships with your financial center partners and associates from the different lines of business within the bank- Merrill, US Trust. Small Business Banking, Commercial Banking, etc.  and build your pipeline to the point that after the first 12 months, when you are transitioned to a lower base salary, your commissions are sizable enough to more than make up the difference. I've been in this role for a little more than 12 months and I am currently living this reality, but not all of my colleagues have been so lucky. During the first twelve months it is my advice to board as many loans as possible- purchase, refinance, and HELOC, and to not worry about the loan amounts. This not only puts you in a good position to reach the 12 month bonus goal, but it allows you to effectively learn the ins and outs of the internal processing, underwriting, and closing processes, and helps fortify your working relationships with your financial center partners who you will find are your strongest and most consistent source of leads. Demonstrating your ability to deliver for your teammates while simultaneously making a name for yourself with your clients and business partners in the community will put you in the best possible position to transition out of the runway period. The pricing is incredible, especially for preferred rewards clients, and jumbo loans. If a borrower has accounts with the bank you save a good amount of time tracking down asset statements, and gathering contact information, which can be a fairly arduous process compared to working for a broker or correspondent lender", "cons": "The underwriting standards are TOUGH, but once you learn them, you'll find yourself working almost exclusively with borrowers who are more than qualified, as opposed to chasing deals ridden with credit/income/asset issues. Most likely your processors and underwriters will be based off-site at the regional fulfillment center, which can lead to communication breakdowns. Despite the division of labor, which is intended to streamline the processing, you'll need to be plugged in every step of the way to ensure your loans close on time.

If your co workers suck you are going to want to quit, if they are awesome it makes you at least get through the day. I've been lucky to work with great co workers. I have friends who work at other branches that haven't been so lucky. If you have two or more women working together who don't like each other you're in for some drama. A good branch manager really helps.\r\n- A lot of tellers at a branch are either part time students, part time moms, or full timers who are content with being tellers.

I've worked at two separate branches and we lost 3 people in the first one without replacement and 2 in the second without replacement each year. You are regularly processing 250-300+ transactions a day which exhausts you at the end of the day as you have to engage customers for referrals on top of that. You really stop caring about giving good customer service or referring clients by the end of the day because you are too tired from the 100 people you've already helped that day. \r\n- SALES ORIENTED. Make no mistake - management loves you if you can refer clients to the bankers for sales or will see you as expendable if you can't. Simple truth. Only the top 10-15ish out of 100 CSRs in a market make their quarterly BCR (banker conservation rate goal). If you can be one who meets their goals you are in line for a promotion if you can't you're out of luck.\r\n- NEPOTISM. Market leaders will look to give out promotions to those they like.
