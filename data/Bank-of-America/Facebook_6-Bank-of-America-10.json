Something that definitely appears to be a common theme is upper-management searching for the \u2018next hot thing\u2019, which is generally a talented individual that has been hired somewhat recently. The internal bureaucracy of the company can allow talented, long standing agents, to not be considered due to a variety of factors. This issue seems to be exasperated towards agents that engage in leaves if absence as well. Those of whom that took LOA\u2019s have to go through a level of training proportional to their time away from the company. Unfortunately, a seemingly common  social business aspect, is one in which it almost feels management frequently doubts the ability of said agents. This ideology can be harmful rhetoric, pushing employees to not utilize their PTO to be viewed as \u2018committed\u2019."}, {"review_title": "Sales heavy", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Relationship Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay for you with benefits", "cons": "Lots of pressure to sell"}, {"review_title": "Good company", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "7 May 2021", "job_title": "Relationship Banker in Warwick, RI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefit, good pay, good place to work", "cons": "Any at the moment is good company to work"}, {"review_title": "BoA", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 May 2021", "job_title": "Financial Center Manager in San Antonio, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wonderful benefits for all employees", "cons": "Working six days a week and taking time off is very difficult"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Receptionist in Annapolis, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible no pressure and friendly", "cons": "Low pay, benefits and perks"}, {"review_title": "ib", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Associate in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "strong salary compensation and bonus", "cons": "long hours and tight deadlines"}, {"review_title": "fine", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Teller I in Saint Paul, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great place to work at", "cons": "there are no, great place"}], [{"review_title": "As a whole they are great", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "3 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative (CSR) in Syracuse, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits\r\nGreat pay\r\nWork life balance", "cons": "Direct management cares only about numbers\r\nStressful"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work with excellent benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Senior Underwriter in Jacksonville, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work with excellent benefits", "cons": "No cons its a great place to work"}, {"review_title": "Stable job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Investment Banking Associate in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stable job, wont get laid off, strong diversity program.", "cons": "Less competitive follow on opportunities.
