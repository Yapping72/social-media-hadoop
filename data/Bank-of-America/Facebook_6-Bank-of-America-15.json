They give you a staffing system that tells you how many tellers you need on any given day.  But the rub is if you follow that schedule to the letter?  You end up WAY over on your payroll hours.  They tell you to trust the schedule but don't give you the staff to MEET the schedule.\r\n\r\nTraining?  Yeah, good luck with that.

Our managers preached to us about meeting goals and being customer-oriented, but did not display any of these traits in front of the staff.

I am a very fast teller, I consider myself to have great customer services skills, and I am efficient, being always on balance.

They do not and refuse to change their marketing strategy. (in doing so they'll continue to fail- good luck with that!)\r\n\r\nThey promise that they will help and support your wanting to \"move up\" --- these claims are false. They understaff their branches to the point that somehow the managers can't seem to \"let you go\" meaning moving up would mean that they would lose a teller so they can't. So you suffer. You're overworked, doing tasks that someone in a higher position usually does still making lower pay. \r\n\r\nThey claim to have an open policy, meaning you can even \"coach\" your own manager in wrong behavior or point out anything that she/he did wrong or goes against the usual rigid Bank of America Script (yes I said script) but in actuality, you'll get some lashes of attitude, unjust treatment and so on. And the longer your Manager has been with the company, the worse. \r\n\r\nUNDERSTAFFED- UNDERSTAFFED-UNDERSTAFFED- get read to juggle way too much. Two tellers for four windows? How does that even make any sense? Customers will always be irrate with the wait and you also get timed on how long customers wait. They never offer any help, or fix the problem they will just consistently blame it on the tellers. Two hands, two feet. Customers are trusting you the bank with their money. \r\n\r\nThey offer Teller Supervisors to assist tellers on the line and supervise. Yet wait they fail to tell you is that this title is bogus. You are either a teller. Or you're a mid go-fer. Welcoming customers all day and dealing with issues that the manager should be dealing with. Do remember that the title is TELLER SUPERVISOR.

Tellers are left alone waiting for overrides, customer help and anything else in between in limbo looking like fools in front of customers for minutes at a time (remember, you're getting timed !)\r\n\r\nTraining is absolutely horrible! How do you expect someone to come into the company and get trained by a computer from beginning to end with all computerized features? The customers are 3d images, your teller drawer, etc. Pathetic. Where is the hands on training? This is a multi bilion dollar bank with customers depending on the tellers firsthand to be able to navigate the system and products.

Upper management is out of touch with Associates in \"front line\" roles (specifically, the banking center channel). Due to falling revenue the Bank has had to layoff what they consider non-essential roles, while they seem to be smothering branch leaders and their staff, as well as market leaders (\"market\" aka district). The company is very routine/process focused, which is not a bad thing, however, it is oftentimes impossible to complete all of the tasks required and get the type of results that keep your job 'secure'. Lastly, and perhaps MOST importantly, I would like to point out: there is a Distinct disconnect and Lack of Opportunity for those who are Top performers in the Consumer and Small Business banking segment of this company. Those thatwork in Charlotte --the headquarters for BOA-- and who are not in the banking center channel, seem to have Many more opportunities than those that get literally \"stuck\" in theconsumer banking world.  You would think that the company would not only take the step of identifying top talent, but after doing so, would take necessary steps to leverage these talented individuals. The Consumer banking channel represents 70% + of the company's profits, yet there doesnt seem to be enough leveraging of individuals from this part of the business when it is time to employ process improvements/update/change/review tools and routines. There are several Departments (and Project teams) that focus on this leg of the business, though these departments Rarely include employees who have come up through the ranks of the consumer 'world' (even though many of them have received advanced degrees and are performing at the highest levels). I say all this to say that you must be careful what part of this Bank you get hired into, because you could be there (not learning or developing) for a very longtime regardless of well you do; it's almost like they want to selfishly keep you held hostage 'because' of how good you are (can't afford to lose you). Recently, there have been Many employees leaving BOA because of some of the above (not scientific, but I know several of them (and they, as was I, were Top Performers).\r\n2. Training and Scheduling: the on the job training is not working. Associates are never fully prepared because there is little to No real quality time for training, especially since operations and the face to face time with customers is necessary to grow the business. You cannot get a gallon of juice from a piece of dried up fruit. Those who are not actively working in branches continue to ask for more: more processes to be completed, more operations to be done, more training, and of course more sales (understood because this is a for-profit corporation).  Quite frankly, I and my team were doing well, but I found working for this company to be simply too much of a strain on my personal life and overall health and well-being.\r\n3. Recognition varies depending on the Leadership team. Salary was Great but Money just simply was not enough to make me stay. I got the same pay, with Better training, more support, and a better quality of life at another Financial Institution.\r\n4.

Very few of the remaining managers in preferred sales/Advanced Client Solutions have EVER done your job. The one that have all left, and their replacements are nothing more than well-trained company \"yes men\". They do not care about you the employee. They only care about advancing their own careers.  They are perfectly content pushing policies and procedures that make zero sense, because at the end of the day...they don't have to do your job.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, there are great departments in the bank, that are more in line with what they advertise on their career page. But I would not, under any circumstances recommend anyone work as a front-line customer service/sales rep.\r\n\r\nTheir yearly \"employee satisfaction survey\" is a joke. They actually have each team in my department take the survey together, in a separate room and have a manager in there coaching us on all of the great things that came out of the survey in previous years, etc etc. They even give us candy. There are always big changes that some after the survey is over....just not good ones.

My case was a student loan payment that I had missed. \r\nKeeping the job is contingent upon the fact that you pass the beastly Series 7 Exam. The material is extremely difficult and they don't train you for it at all...they just throw you a couple books that are poorly written and extremely confusing, and a link to a website that is even worse.\r\nThe majority of people who work there don't even use the material that's how bad it is. They go off to use Kaplan. \r\nIf you don't pass you get to take it again. \r\nHonestly the whole process of working there for the first 6 months is extremely stressful because you're constantly faced with the fact that you may not have a job much longer. This is the situation that just happened with me. \r\nI have 2 children, finally got hired at a company after about 2 years of a dry spell and the birth of a baby last year, and it felt so good to get my kids and I off of Medicaid and food stamps. I ended up not passing the exam with the demands from this job....the forced overtime and having to raise 2 children.\r\nI didn't have the time that they require to study to pass this exam. I did bring it to their attention that there were a few sections that I needed extra help on that I didn't understand and they would offer help only to have it taken away because call volumes are more of a concern. \r\nAs much as I tried I just wasn't able to get a successful score on the exam and now I am out of my job.\r\nI have lost all of my insurance and I just got off the phone with the welfare office again because I need to have our insurance turned back on. I have a baby with a medical condition and we need to have him covered asap.\r\nI was just about to go and get us a better apartment and now that's not going to happen.

I felt like I was a child living in this person's house and had to follow their rules regardless. There were never 2 sides to a situation, it was always a \"my way or the highway\" mentality.  I had a very hard time with this, particularly with the lack of outside oversight. The manager is your real opportunity for promotion/visibility and if that relationship doesn't work you are toast. I have many friends that work in corporate jobs in the bank and love it. I am also sure other banking centers are awesome, I just didn't choose the right place for me.

There are multiple teams at the home office with different jobs but in the field there\u2019s only the field fsa (not counting the gwim roles like bfa). Most reviews are for either of these positions, but I\u2019ve done both roles, & over a year\u2019s time in each. I worked on different home office teams when I was at the center, and since moving to the field at a local BofA I worked at 2 centers before resigning. I have Merrill top performer  \u201cbulls\u201d and I\u2019ve also been on written warning. I\u2019ve experienced this role inside & out.\r\n\r\nPros: all from the center. Coming licensed and with phone sales experience I started on a well paid team with no adherence and only talking to people interested in investing with Edge. Bonuses even after cuts were ok, 401k match after a year, & annual contribution that vests after 3 yrs, paid time off, vacation, several health plan choices. Most new employees  get stuck on inbound service teams listening to complaints all day. I lucked out because of my prior experience & licensing.  After a year and working on 2 different teams at the center I transferred to the field fsa role.", "cons": "Cons: all from the field fsa role. You\u2019re just a licensed banker, like most other reviews state. Especially since adoption to DOL ruling removed everything an fsa can do on the investment side except open online accounts,  refer to Merrill Lynch, or enroll in Merrill Edge Select Portfolios, and if you do that, once enrolled the reviews are all done by a home office team. That means no relationship for you to build on with any of these options, b/c compliance prohibits field fsa\u2019s from proactively calling on these clients.\r\n\r\nMost of your day is spent doing banking, and sadly, the fsa is pressured  to get more bank referrals, \u201cpresent\u201d credit card offers, and open new deposit accounts. Any Merrill Edge business is a one time transaction, you don\u2019t build a book and don\u2019t build a relationship either. The msm is just a policeman who's job it is to make sure you are hitting the numbers,  issue warnings, or fire you if you don\u2019t make the unrealistic metrics. No positive coaching, like discussions  about long term career goals after the fsa role. Constant micromanaging to make sure recorded calls are done daily, bank products have been offered to everyone to sit with, and overall the fsa is treated like an entry level banker on their first job right out of college. Not to mention constant pressure to sell MESP, which is garbage and clients (along with many people at the firm, too) know it. Since BofA chose to realign the fsa to consumer banking from wealth management, it was also decided at that time to essentially treat us like bankers and not like financial advisors anymore. \r\n\r\nMost msm\u2019s don't how each bank is in a different city, demographic, and the foot traffic is different. BofA keeps pushing people to do everything online, on the app, or at the atm to reduce costs but keeps insisting its realistic to expect each fsa at any center to consistently see 5 to 7 people per day. \r\n\r\nCompliance is a nightmare having to deal with it both from BofA and Merrill Edge. You have to know how to open, process, and service both BofA and Merrill Edge/Lynch accounts, which can take a while to learn. Even though I was an internal transfer, training for the fsa role was a joke and all I learned was how not to get in trouble on the bank side, & hardly any time was spent on investment training, knowledge, and how to be a successful financial advisor.

On call and you go 20 minutes over when you are supposed to take lunch? You better cut that out!  Try to imagine doing that 9 hours a day.  Every, single, day!\r\n\r\nGlorified banker - You are a \"financial advisor\" but the only advising you can do is either open a none-advised self-direct account, or into a \"robo advised\" product where the financial advisor aspect is taken out. Thats right, you can NOT recommend a product where you are involved.  Try convincing clients to move their accounts over when you tell them that.\r\n\r\nRegulations to the max - To verify a client you have to verify FIVE PIECES OF INFORMATION.  Try doing that at the start of a conversation and going anywhere with it.  Any time investments are brought up you have to read a paragraph disclosure.  Im not joking, its a paragraph!  Any time you do a \"review\" with the client you have to touch on multiple financial terms and make sure the client fully understands. You can already picture the reaction when you try explaining multiple financial terms to a discount brokerage client, who you will be lucky if they even have heard of a mutual fund.\r\n\r\nArchaic Systems-  They are too cheap to update their software.  You will be using systems from 1999 to document every single one of your calls. They are too cheap to invest into salesforce.  Maybe they just like the software because it seems to \"forget\" to credit you for half of your paid out metrics, forcing you to document, monitor, and keep track of every single potential payout.

So your time won't be spent on improving your bonus.\"\r\nQ: \"What happens if one of my assigned clients closes their account?\"\r\nA: \" We take $$$ from your bonus. We don't care if you have never spoken to the person...it's your fault.\"\r\nQ: \"Do people enjoy working here?\"\r\nA: \"Everyone hates it here, everyone is underemployed, everyone is embarrassed by what they do. Our first team in Rolling Meadows had 3 people quit in their first 9 months.\r\nQ: \"What is the vacation policy?\"\r\nA:  \" We do give you a fair amount of days off. Pretty much no chance you'll ever get a Friday (you have to use you sick days) and no way you'll ever get a day before a bank holiday.\"\r\nQ \"How is management?\"\r\nA: \" When of our leaders comes to the office, everyone is required to wear suits. The managers don't speak to anyone on the team and just hide in their offices.\"\r\nQ: \" How are our calls monitored?\"\r\nA: \" There is a dedicated team that will do everything possible to fail you. These low scores directly impact your bonus.\"\r\nQ: \"What skills will I learn?\"\r\nA: \"Everything you'll learn is only specific to Merrill Edge. So your experience here won't help you at all. And on top of that, you'll have to explain why you took a service role at a call center.\"\r\nQ: \"I was told that top reps have quarterly bonuses of 30K and higher.
