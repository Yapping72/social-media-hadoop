Upper management continues to move the goalposts with regards to their expectations for financial center employees, and they consistently fail to follow through on their word.\n\nThey routinely neglect the emotional well-being of their associates. Turnover and staff shortages are rampant with no end in sight. There is always a long hold to submit HR complaints because they are also understaffed and inundated with frustrated employees. \n\nUpper management seems to be willingly exploiting the dysfunction. They are completely unable and or unwilling to grasp the severity of the problems financial center staff face on a daily basis. Yet they attempt to micromanage every asinine detail of their associates' workday despite the fact they are essentially never physicslly present, opting instead to cower at home remotely while their most vulnerable staff are left to scramble together answers for leadership that refuses to accept critcism of any kind.\n\nThey want to wring their hands and deflect accountability because of the pandemic, but only in ways that suit them at the top. For regular employees who aren't given remote work options, too bad.

As a relationship banker working as a teller they expect you to ask probing questions and set up appointments. When you\u2019re at the teller line and there is a line of people waiting that is unrealistic. I think that the title of the role and the description is a bait and switch tactic. They use the possibility of promotion to keep employees motivated but I saw very little signs of promotions at the two financial centers I worked at. Also, they hired me and trained me at one location but wouldn\u2019t tell me what bank I would end up working at after training. They\u2019re very inflexible about switching roles.

Also, you're told to do upskilling training modules in your free time but discouraged from doing it during work hours. But you're not allowed to do the modules from home.
