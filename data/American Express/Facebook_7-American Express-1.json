See for yourself.\r\n\r\n- UNETHICAL sales tactics and UNBELIEVABLE internal red tapes.\r\n\r\n- AT YOUR OWN RISK, LACKS JOB STABILITY. Middle management is safe for a year or two. However, Senior Manager/Executive/VP/GM are generally the first to get redundancy packages when there is a cost-cutting measure. If you are in a sales position (non-leadership role), you have about 6 months to 1 year to prove yourself to stay in the job. Reducing sales pipeline and your target DOUBLES each year!\r\n\r\n- Slow career progression. Only when there is an opportunity is when someone goes to a competitor. There are many internal politics at play and behind curtain deals. They already have brought someone from other business segments to fill in the space. However, for hiring compliance reasons, they would advertise the role and interview others just for the sake of it. So don't expect any career and personal development.\r\n\r\n- Most leaders lack skills, experience and knowledge compared to other competitors.\r\n\r\n- It was only bearable before the pandemic, during COVID, and now, the company has no strategic direction. TARGETS are unrealistic, and there are no exceptions."}], [{"review_title": "Good Leadership, Benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 May 2022", "job_title": "Senior Product Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, good leadership, good culture", "cons": "Management decisions take a long time.
