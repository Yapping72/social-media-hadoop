I do think they try to invest in people (although not as much as they need to in compensation) and want employees to establish a long-term relationship with the company. \r\n\r\nMost people tend to stay at least a few years, and they almost never get rid of people for petty reasons. Senior management is generally strong and good at communicating information about the company. If you don't know how the company is doing, it's your fault, which isn't always the case at companies. There is good opportunity to move around, sometimes too good, but you're usually not pigeonholed into a certain for your entire career with the company. In fact, you had better serve in different functions if you want to move up the ladder. \r\n\r\nPay and bonuses are simply too low (see below), but PTO is generous, particularly when you get to manager and above. The Culture Card is an underrated benefit for New York employees. Generally, people don't stay too late. Amex is particularly good for women and people with kids. In fact, it almost seems like women have better chances of promotion and movement in departments like marketing. Be prepared to shell out money every week for the wedding and baby showers.\r\n\r\nOverall, Amex is a decent place to work (you won't have too many days when you dread coming to work, which I can't say about some other places I've been), and it's certainly a good name on your resume. However, there are definite issues that ultimately drive people away after a few years.", "cons": "OK, have to start with compensation. The pay is simply too low given the background and performance they expect from people. To spend $80,000 on a brand-name B-school and end up with a $90,000 a year job just isn't worth it. This is New York, where a studio can cost $2,000 a month, and American Express's compensation just doesn't cut it. Also, HR openly admits (at least they're open about it) that the goal is to be no more than average for the industry. For a company that constantly preaches to drive for excellence, I think it owes its employees something a little better than mediocre compensation. Also, the health insurance HSA is poor. All it takes is one expensive prescription and that \"savings\" account is wiped out. The 401K plans stunk when they had Ameriprise funds, but they may be a little better now. \r\n\r\nThe jobs themselves, particularly in marketing, don't even really warrant the fancy degrees anyway. If you're smart and a quick learner, you can pick it up quickly. Most of the challenge is navigating the acronym maze to find the right person to get done what you need to get done, not actual strategy. Honestly, when you get a new boss, you may be much more of a subject matter expert than that person given all the movement in the company. \r\n\r\nThe culture can be a mixed bag. It definitely has a bit of sorority/country club vibe to it. You have to be very careful about what you say, because there is a lot of gossip. You can look forward to a lot of \"Well, some of your colleagues say x\" type of feedback from your manager, making you wonder what you did to deserve that kind of feedback when it seems like your colleagues think highly of you. You also pretty much have to do extracurricular activities such as employee satisfaction committees if you want to be considered a team player. Most of them are just bogus talking shops that waste time, but you better get on one, and if you become a Director or VP, you'll have to lead them. \r\n\r\nAmex is very matrixed and consensus driven, leading to a very slow-moving, conservative culture. If you're looking to do cutting-edge, exciting work, look elsewhere. This is a place for people who don't rock the boat. The slow decisionmaking process always pops up in employee surveys, but it never changes. You will be doing a lot of \"aligning\", having meetings to prepare for meetings, meetings to recap meetings, and of course decks. Without Powerpoint, half the company would have nothing to do, particularly VPs and above. I actually think Sr. Manager and Director positions are more interesting than most VP roles because as Director or Manager, you actually do things, rather than talk about doing them. The majority of people in the company come from the same 5-10 b-schools plus a few different financial services firms and big consulting firms. This leads to groupthink, along with the obsession with meetings and decks. If you don't come from these places, you will have a hard time moving up and you won't get some of the special access these folks get (particularly B-school interns and recruits). Promotions are overwhelmingly from within, which is great for the most part, but as you get higher up, there is very little new blood or original thinking. \r\n\r\nOh, and if you hear the words \"American Express Technologies\" associated with one of your projects, run away, run far away. IT is bad at best, shows what you get by skimping and having your tech people in Phoenix instead of Silicon Valley or someplace with actually competent talent.\r\n\r\nThe review/rating/posting process can also be pretty phony and political, as it is in most companies. The \"Goal\" rating is pretty straightforward, except that if you exceed your goal but everyone else does as well, you may not get a top rating since ratings are based on a fairly strict curve. While you want the company to do well, ultimately, you don't want your colleagues to do TOO well, or you lose money. Brilliant system. On the one hand, everyone preaches the value of teamwork. On the other, you want to make sure your \"teammates\" do worse than you so you can get a better rating. \r\n\r\nThe \"leadership\" rating is complete New Age corporatespeak BS. It's basically based on how well-liked you are. If you're a rah-rah \"I love the the Blue Box and every idea my boss has is fantastic\" type, you'll be fine. If you like to question and are skeptical, you aren't a \"team player\" or you don't communicate well. Also, while HR talks a lot about 360 feedback and giving your manager upward feedback, good luck actually doing it. Amex managers don't tend to react well to anything but the most benign \"upward feedback\". \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, one of the really positive aspects to the corporate culture is the ability to move around. Just know that the politics surrounding performance evaluation apply to posting for new jobs. The mediocre performer who goes with the flow and is on a bunch of ESAT committees gets the rewards, while people who question things don't get very far. Understand that when I say \"question things\" I don't being contrarian for the sake of standing out, but pointing out legitimate issues that could hamper a project and offering alternative solutions. If you aren't high up the food chain, this kind of thing can be seen as not being a team player.\r\n\r\nAlso know that even getting a good rating doesn't guarantee you a promotion. People from the chosen B-Schools and consulting firms are usually favored. In addition to the rating you see in your evaluation, there is also a 'shadow rating' - the so-called 9-box, that you are not allowed to see. This basically determines how far you go in the company. If the higher-ups feel you're great at your current job but don't have potential for advancement, even outstanding performance may not help you.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the culture leads to people staying for a few years, and then most people get sick of the red tape and politics. Or, they realize that the company thinks they have maxed out their potential based on the 9-box and know they won't move up. You see very few older people in the Tower who aren't senior management. It's not so much the case at the service centers, where promotion isn't as big a goal. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, Amex is a good place to build your skills and brown-nosing ability, but it's more of a jumping off point for most than a home."}, {"review_title": "Still an old Wall Street company at the end of the day...", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Aug 2011", "job_title": " in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work-life balance, generally very nice people with strong focus on customer service, very much concerned about the safety and security of its customers.", "cons": "Since Amex values safety and security so much, it is extremely slow to change and adopt new technologies.

Bad surveys stay on your report for 30 days and commission is paid once a month so you do the math. \r\n\r\nThe schedule is soooooooo strict. You are not even allowed to use the bathroom whenever you want with out being questioned. You get one 40 mins lunch break and two 10 mins breaks if you work an 8 hour shift. If you don't handle your bathroom duties during that time, you can expect to have a meeting with your team leader about you not adhering to your schedule. \r\n\r\nThe PTO structure is also generous (23 days per year) BUT, if you work in customer service and you want a federal holiday off you will have to use your PTO days. But you can even forget about having any holidays off your first year working there. Time off requests are based off seniority and availability. Once everything is taken, then too bad for you, you just lose your days. The sick time was accrued at a rate of 4 hours per month and you can roll over sick days."}, {"review_title": "Travel Counselor", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "14 Nov 2017", "job_title": "Travel Counselor in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Company benefits are excellent.

They lure you in with the sweetness of the salary and benefits addicting you to the \"high\", but once you are \"hooked\" they begin to turn the screws demanding more and more output.  The incremental increases in compensation tends not to keep up with the pressure, resulting in a growing personal dissatisfaction.  However, you cannot leave because you are unable to find comparable compensation elsewhere.  \r\n\r\nSenior Management follows the same communication cycle every year:  1st quarter - Last year was a banner year, however, this year will be one of our worst.  Everyone needs to buckle down, cut back and prepare for the worst.  2nd quarter/3rd quarter - Results have been better than expected!  We're up where we should and we're down where we want to be.  Let's stay on course and try to finish the year strong!  4th quarter - Wow!  It was one of the best years ever!  We're killing the competition and profits were amazing.  Then it repeats all over again.  As an employee, you cannot tell when there truly is a reason to be concerned about any given year during the first quarter.  It always made me feel like the Senior Management did not \"trust\" employees with the true information about the current environment.  It would be much better to say that the company operates extremely conservatively during the 1st & 2nd quarters of the fiscal year.  I'm not a child.  Please don't act like you need to \"shield\" me from the operating philosophy and performance of MY company.\r\n\r\nAmex operates so conservatively as to be inefficient.  The company does not want new and innovative ideas that may incur cost, even when that incremental cost could have huge returns.  A prime example is the condition of the technology at Amex.  It is outdated, difficult to maneuver, and extremely inefficient.  The systems used by customer-facing reps are so dilapidated and outdated it is embarrassing.  These should be priority 1 for upgrade and redesign, without delay.  The restrictions on technology development are so overbearing that it feels useless to suggest any new ideas or changes.  And this feeds into the internal culture of \"we'll make it ridiculously difficult for you to make any progress so eventually, you'll stop bothering with your nonsense\"."}, {"review_title": "Highly Enjoy Working at American Express", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Mar 2010", "job_title": "Finance Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Development: Good opportunities, particularly in Finance - if you are a strong performer, there is much room to move, and to move upward quickly.

Most days I work 9 to 6:30, and it's very flexible if I need to leave earlier. Occasionally work from home when I need to. There may be a few late nights in a month (after 7pm, ranging to maybe around 10pm max). It's generally manageable in terms of career and also personal life.\r\n\r\nSalary: They changed the Bonus Incentive compensation structure recently, so for Managers, your bonus is all in cash. It used to be 50/50 cash & stock. This past year I banked a $24K cash bonus, which isn't bad considering the very good hours I work (for NYC), the development opportunities to move around and grow my career. Keep in mind I'm a Manager, at the Director level, you're looking at $40-$60k cash bonus + $20k in stock. VP's will generally take home a $50-100k cash bonus + stock + other leadership performance type bonuses. So while we don't pay investment bank salaries, neither does AmEx work you to death either.\r\n\r\nGenerally you will find the Managers at American Express to be in the 25-35 year old range, and Directors can be in the 28-40 year old range, and VPs+ and above can be in the 30-50 yr range. Obviously the star performers would be young. So if you're talented, you can rise at AmEx quickly, work good hours, and bank $100k - $250k a year (depending on level).

Politics play a large role. SVPs choose VPs, VPs choose Directors and Directors choose managers based on unpublished and many times intangible criteria.

There is a standing mandate for preference towards women and minorities(if applicable)  however, in my experience, the pool for outstanding women and minorities is very small compared to other demographics. However, the biggest CON is the lack of a documented path to advancement. No one can tell you exactly how to move up. They will tell you what they \"think\" is the way, or maybe the way \"they\" did it, but there is no documented or accurate way to plan your development.

For example, a customer can provide feedback that they were unhappy with their line of credit (something that a CCP has no control over) and give the process a poor rating; the CCP is then held accountable for that rating.  Adding salt to the wound is that fact the majority of the calls have to receive an excellent rating (Top Box Score) or the CCPs don't meet the goals for \"customer satisfaction.

What they didn't tell me is that AmEx keeps moving the bar further away as you get closer to the finish line.  The metrics are unfair and unrealistic to earn a regular bonus.  Every customer gets an opportunity to submit a survey, however, the LAST AmEX employee to speak to the customer, during each call, is upon whom the survey falls.  Therefore, if the customer speaks to collections first, and gets angry during the call, then collections transfers the call to you to discuss having misplaced their credit card, everything they say in the angry survey is credited to YOU.  One survey with a \"poor\" rating will cause you to lose your entire bonus for a rolling 3 month period!  Another unfair metric is counted when you assist a customer and they call again within 7 days.  Even if the customer calls back for a totally different reason, the fact that they called at all within 7 days means you did not properly assist them.  For example, if the customer calls you to pay their bill, then 3 days later calls again for a password reset, THAT is counted against YOU because the customer called back within 7 days.  This, too, counts against your bonus.  Further, there are no assigned workspaces.  Seating is in a first-come-first-selected area.  You are assigned a locker for your personal belongings, but change desks from shift-to-shift.  The workspace is approximately 20x40 with only a small panel between each desk.

The company's reputation is built on the notion of excellence - from product design, to customer service, to employee know-how (thought leadership).

Likewise, roles at all levels can be robust, some coming with a high level of autonomy that you might not enjoy at other large corporate entities.", "cons": "American Express is a company that operates on relationships and while this can be very positive from a team, cross-functional aspect, it can be nebulous when moving up in a promotional sense.  It quickly becomes the who-you-know game, who has tagged you as a future leader or someone they know and want on their team now and/or in the future.  Leaders often choose people they know to be on their teams and these individual often follow them throughout their career at Amex, getting promoted as their 'sponsor' gets promoted.  What's challenging is that there is not always a correlation to that person being the best, most suited talent to get promoted and so you find some really smart people who despite having the chops, never reach the level in the organization that would truly mirror the value they bring.  Naturally many of these people eventually leave the company out of this frustration, though primarily they enjoyed the work and the challenges that working at American Express can bring from an enrichment standpoint.\r\n\r\nThe other major challenge is that while there are a bevy of really smart, talented individuals, the quality of leadership is lacking.  Many leaders simply don't know how to inspire their teams, enhance their employees' strengths, and set the tone for a collaborative, positive working environment.  Likewise, the culture can vary greatly by business unit.  It can be shocking, the variability in culture, particularly since recruiting is done from the same suite of schools where there is typically some uniformity in culture-type, it's not like most of these individuals come in as bad apples.  The problem lies in the top down leadership, poor leadership behavior that is 'bestowed' upon employees to adopt and emulate.  This is in stark contrast to Amex's CEO, who has charisma leaping off of him and recognizes, celebrates, and inspires people at all levels.  He's an individual that you immediately feel genuinely welcomed and respected by...but it doesn't trickle far past him (by and large) to senior leadership, which is quite a disappointment.  People leave Amex either because of the challenges of moving up or a leader who makes what could be a cool gig if you will, miserable or a chore to come into every day.  A change up in senior leadership, many who have been with the company for far far too long, could bring in some new blood that welcomes Amex's storied history in a forward looking, game-changing, and inspiring leadership way."}], [{"review_title": "Great pay.

As you start at the company you and your boss discuss your current skill set as well as \"development\" opportunities.  Every year and a half to two years, it is then common to move between jobs at the company, giving you the opportunity to try totally different jobs throughout your career.  It is not uncommon for people to have experience in marketing, sales, account management, and finance.  This movement is not just accepted, it is promoted.  So, even if you decide American Express is not the place for you, you will have the experience to go wherever you want.\r\n\r\nYou will also feel valued in your position.  All jobs will be challenging and you also see how the outputs of your job contribute to company results.  Those who are most successful tend to be those who are flexible and are strong problem solvers.  All jobs (especially manager positions) can be very big, and you can certainly expand your responsibilities if you choose to do so.  \r\n\r\nThe people at the company are also a plus.  Others have mentioned the politics of the company are an issue (which I think is the same anywhere), but most bosses have a genuine interest in seeing you succeed and grow.  Your peers will likely become your friends, and it is not uncommon to see close friendships form (or even marriages).  You will also be amazed at the credentials of your coworkers.  At least on paper, you will be working with some of the most talented people in corporate America.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of promotions are filled within the company, which is a major benefit.  There is less \"teaching\" new bosses how the company works, and there are several chances to advance.  All new positions are filled through a \"posting\" process, which are open competitions.  While some people get \"tapped\" into jobs, it is rare.  You should not expect to start in a job and continue to get promoted in the same group.  \r\n\r\nHours are terrific (although this varies group to group), and people seem to be working longer these days.  But, it is rare to ever see anyone in on the weekend.  With Blackberrys, though, there are more e-mails late at night and during the weekend.  Vacation days (which are on an annual use or lose system) are utilized by all employees, and there are rarely questions when someone takes time.  This policy also extends to maternity and paternity leave, which are quite common.\r\n\r\nOverall, American Express is a great place to start and grow a career.", "cons": "Most people have mentioned compensation.  This is a reality that surfaces in every group and is often spoken about.  But, the situation seems to be even more relevant recently as the company has made changes to stock grants, 401K, and bonus compensation that have further exacerbated the difference in what people could earn at similar companies.  A decline in health benefits has also deteriorated to the point that anyone with options under their spouses choose those.  Conversations about the equation of accepting this discrepancy versus leaving are common and somewhat demoralizing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, American Express has always been lauded for respecting their employees.  This year, they have discontinued the employee survey, taking away the most effective way of letting senior management know of problem bosses and major employee issues. \r\n\r\nRecent layoffs have also been problematic as certain people leaders who were very well thought of by their employees were let go.  While it is often preached that talent development is important, and that winning at all costs is discouraged, the recent fallout of the layoffs did not support this policy."}, {"review_title": "Like many large corporations American Express succeeds in spite of itself", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Apr 2009", "job_title": "Business Analyst I in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The company tries to look out for the best interest of it's employees with good pay and benefits.

Those with minimal risk or small projects that are implemented in less than a year receive favorable ratings.\r\n- Everyone is graded on a curve - which does not work well when you are on a top performing team being compared against middle performing groups.  A person rated at 50% in a top 5% team will not receive recognition (or very very minimal) different than someone who is rated at 50% at a 50% performing team.   It does not make sense to go above and beyond at American Express and expect corresponding recognition/compensation.\r\n- What once was a very collaborative and engaging company is rallying around silos, personal projects, and avoids risks.   Too much finger pointing happens from long entrenched middle management who are able to manage through the basics.\r\n- Blue Work program, while highly regarded by the HR department, has forced many employees into situations that have negatively impacted ability to perform.\r\n- Innovation is talked about frequently, but strict adherence to quarterly results drives funding for new programs.   Great ideas that align with long term market/industry trends get cut all the time if they don't deliver within a very short timeframe.   All technical development of new assets is handled by 3rd party firms that staff with low cost resources - almost always with offshore teams that lack the qualifications needed.  It is no surprise when the products are of mediocre quality at best.\r\n- Everyone is scared.  With layoffs, inconsistent ratings, and constant budget cuts, it is hard to predict what comes next.  The Execs are fighting over who will be the next CEO which has a downstream impact over their organizations.\r\n- Ken Chenault yet again had a 24% pay increase to $28 million dollars last year.  Many  employees made less this year than last (lower bonus), due to \u201ctougher company performance\u201d which included an artificial restructuring charge so they could lay off 5500 people.

There's no way to truly provide anonymous 360 feedback in a meaningful way for your leaders, so these terrible leaders rarely every grow or improve over time. There's also a very passive aggressive culture, especially within the New York office, and transparency is something everyone would talk about but no one dares to actually be transparent. Most of the time, we felt like it was one big puppet show. That the senior-level people with all the information controlled everything and your leaders really had no idea what's waiting for the team aside from what they could see for next month or quarter. I saw so many teams getting blindsided by \"sudden\" layoffs. On another note, bad news is discouraged; you never want to report a red status on your project unless you can spin it in a positive way (i.e. you're already working on a solution to fix the problem by next week!). Things move really slowly (as other reviews noted, it is a bank).

Sometimes I feel the so-called matrix structure is just an excuse for the lack of a streamlined business process and management structure.\r\n\r\nIf you come up with a great idea, and after all your effort, it starts to deliver results and show great potential, your misfortune begins, because suddenly everyone wants to be part of the success and have a say, and in no time the project is going to be managed by a committee through town hall meetings.  \r\n\r\nYou are trained to use the \u201cRASIC\u201d model to navigate this organization, to determine who is Responsible party, who is Approver, who is Supporting partner, who needs to be Informed, and who should be Consulted.  If you are responsible for a project, you should have only one Approver, right? No, it never works this way.  Think about it - If anyone can disapprove you, he or she automatically becomes an Approver\u2026\r\n\r\nDepending on which group you work for, your experience at Amex can range from highly satisfied to totally miserable.  I personally experienced both.  Marketing is the center of universe here.  Others are considered staff groups or \"utility\" groups.  If you work in a utility group, you have to bear with some ignorant folks who happen to work in marketing and consider themselves superior to anyone else and know how to do your job better than you...  However, you probably can learn more transferable skills in staff groups, if you want to change job in future.\r\n\r\nIf you want to move up the career ladder, you need to move around internally every 1-2 years to get broader exposure.  However, some recent policy changes make lateral move much less rewarding \u2013 now you have to stay in a position for 18 months, before being eligible for promotion.  If you move to another position at the same level, everything resets.  You have to stay in that position for another 18 months, before qualifying for a promotion.  This takes the incentive out of lateral move.  Every manager wants to apply for senior manager position in another group, regardless of whether he/she qualifies for that.  I think this is bad policy.\r\n\r\nUnlike banks, Amex is a mono-line credit card company, which means it lives and dies by credit card business.  On one hand, this forces the company to innovate constantly and stay ahead of competition. On the other hand, the narrow scope of business (coupled with a strong brand name) tends to give some Amex employees a distorted perception about its role in consumer's financial life.  Coming from a financial services background with exposure to many lines of business, I am often amused by the large ego of Amex's small business card group and how they belittle the consumer card group, and other variations of tempest in a teapot, while in the broader scheme of things, credit card is just a small piece of a consumer or business customer\u2019s financial puzzle.

You'll be working for a stable business that is doing quite well.\r\n\r\n2) Good work life balance in a more relaxed bank type atmosphere (still a bank though as you'll see below) means you'll see your spouse and kids and never get super stressed. \r\n\r\n3) If you play the game and are a good worker - your loyalty is usually rewarded. You'll move up and while compensation is not stellar - a top performer will not have too much to complain about on the comp side.", "cons": "Here's the thing. If you're interested in working at AMEX because of what you read or see in the press - take a closer look. This is a bank first and foremost. The cool stuff you see and hear about is about 1/1000000th of what really goes on and a cloud of PR fluff. If you accept that and are still interested that's fine and to be fair, the cons of what you'll find here are probably no different than any Bank job you'll see on Glassdoor:\r\n\r\n1) Lack of risk taking. Senior management will always take the safer route or one backed up by overwhelming evidence. We're a BANK. With a lot of regulation and oversight. This usually means following the middle ground or being late entrants. You'll have good ideas. Your co-workers will have good ideas. If it's risky though and unless it comes straight from the top down - your idea is guaranteed to go no where beyond a deck. You could spend a whole 12 months writing a deck about stuff you'll never get out the door. It's amazing how the year-end cycle comes and goes and the only tangible output people have is a whole lot of documentation about what we would \"like\" to do. Crazy!\r\n\r\n2) Overuse of the word Innovation. People love to throw around the word innovation. It's like people using the word API in their pitches but can't even explain what REST is. Innovation to your managers is different from what you think (or would like) innovation to be. Innovation is cost-efficiency, it's taking an existing process and fine-tuning it or a big biz dev partnership. It's not hacking away like a startup or being agile (don't get me started on agile). \r\n\r\n3) CYA, CYA, CYA. There is a lot of covering going on. Due to the hypersensitive combination of bank, lack of risk taking and personal ambition - you get a lot of meetings and calls which really are for the purpose of individuals to cover their rear in case things go wrong down the line. This creates abysmal layers of bureaucracy.

Flexible work arrangements. Good work-life balance. Decent pay.", "cons": "I have two main gripes with Amex. 1) HR and the ranking system and 2) remaining willfully ignorant in the face of increased competition.\r\n\r\nFor a company that should treat employees and potential employees nicely, I have often been disappointed by HR. They seem to want to place warm bodies in seats, but are either not empowered or don't care enough to find a good match. They don't seem to care for developing long-term relationships.\r\n\r\nAs a hiring manager, some of the resumes that HR \"screens\" for me are laughable. They could not be more out of touch with what the job actually needs. I have done better to post the job somewhere else and do all the sourcing work on my own. Which makes me shudder to think how many good candidates Amex has turned away because HR simply does not get it. They actually send me the opposite of what I need.\r\n\r\nIt also bothers me that they constantly pat themselves on the back for a job well done, but from what I see, they do very little apart from enforce things like an antiquated ranking system.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to my next point. Amex uses a stack ranking system, straight out of 1950. \r\nMost reasonable companies have gotten rid of this (eg, Microsoft, etc.) because they realize it does not work and only fosters a non collaborative environment.\r\n\r\nThis means your performance is graded on a curve (1 = best 2= average 3= worst). You are compared to your peers, who may have a totally different job than you. You are also rated by people higher up than you. That's right. You are rated by someone who has no idea who you are or what you do. How to get around this? Spend less time on your job and more time meeting higher ups. Makes sense, right? So, even if you work 24-7 you will likely still get rated a 2 (almost no one ever gets a 1). The same rating as your coworker who worked half as much as you, but is not quite bad enough to be a 3. Motivation loss, anyone?\r\n\r\nThis brings me to my final point. Willful ignorance. We know at Amex that certain things we are not good. We are not going to be competitive in the global marketplace much longer if we cannot figure it out. Look at what companies like Square are doing. They are eating our lunch. Yet, we continually make poor choice. We promote people out of loyalty, not competence. We allow incompetent high level managers to remain in their jobs, even after they are rated poorly for years. We allow our technology to be stuck in 1990.

In specific, managers of front-line employees (employees dealing directly with customers) have little initial input on the directions upper management decides upon.  Instead, these managers receive general goals to achieve, and must express these goals effectively to their employees and only when the direction headed poses challenges do managers have the opportunity to offer solutions.\r\nThe second issue I have stems from the first.  Managers at this level, because of the large gap in the heirarchy with their bosses, are not influential enough to have spirited debates with their superiors, but are very vulnerable to disrespect from their direct reports.  To offer a metaphor, being a front-line manager at American Express is like being between a rock and a hard place: You can't talk to your boss the way you might like to, but your employees are at liberty to express their emotions, how they see fit, to you."}, {"review_title": "Amex = great company; provides growth opportunities, ability to move within its divisions & promotes talent from within.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Sept 2008", "job_title": "Dedicated Account Representative in Greensboro, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Senior leadership seems to have the best interest of the company as well as the employee in mind.
