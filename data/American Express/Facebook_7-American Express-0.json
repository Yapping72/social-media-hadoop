So obvious bias on roadshows...certain individual always gets the best roadshows. Obviously because of personal relationship - best friends....but those with real authority also doesn't care.\r\n6. Leaders need to go to roadshows, sometimes whole day during many weekends for past 8-10 months. Sacrifice of more family time even when we work till late every day.\r\n7.

Although many of those are further down the hierarchy and it's true that the further up you climb the more people seem to be huge fans of themselves and how great they are. \r\n\r\nGreat parental leave scheme, which operates on a largely no questions asked basis. On the negative side this isn't well thought out once you return and many experience that although targets are amended that it dead ends the rest of your year as you spend the whole time playing catching up. \r\n\r\nWhen the times are good the role can have its own inherit momentum which means that one can reap the benefits of their hard work and really enjoy themselves. All the most successful people ended up here in the hallowed land where metrics did not matter and they were free to do whatever they wanted. \r\n\r\nThere's a built-in structure of support so for new starters there are a fair few experienced heads to lean on to upskill themselves to a fully ramped target. Nice to have a safe learning environment where you are supported and empowered to succeed by people who are incentivised on making you succeed. \r\n\r\nDepending on your leader there can be a good work life balance with 9-5 widely accepted as fair working hours. Unlike many other financial institutions there is not much expectation to work outside of these hours. The flip side of this is that if you want to be successful in a sales floor with so many people you either need someone feeding you exceptional leads, or to be doing those twelve hour days.", "cons": "Poorly thought-out strategies by disengaged executives who have not once interacted with the clients they are designing products for. This often results in products that are inadequate for their target market, and sales people are punished for the market having no appetite for an ill-fitting product. \r\n\r\nThere's a culture of high performance which means that many tasks do not directly generate revenue and fall between the cracks. These problems / tasks ends up in the lap of those employees furthest down the chain of command who have made the mistake of having an empathetic bone in their body. \r\n\r\nMany high performers are hooked up internally with a key contact feeding them leads. This can be pretty demoralising for those around that successful person. As inside this company / department it really is who you know that determines your success. Especially frustrating as so many of these heralded stars are unremarkable sales people. \r\n\r\nIf you join this company you will lose the will to ever join another meeting as at times these are endless and despite losing half a week you are expected to operate to the same level of metrics. See above re metrics. \r\n\r\nPay is considerably lower than the market rate, so the company very much pay you in the currency of prestige (you know for working for such an illustrious name). On the plus side it does look good on a resume so there is some merit to this argument. \r\n\r\nEndless metrics which mean that you spend hours every day figuring out how to hit these metrics to project that you are doing work. Once you have ticked off these meaningless boxes, then and only can you go about doing tasks that actually generate revenue and earn commission. \r\n\r\nThe Peter Principle in full effect. Some managers are not fully equipped to manage and are left in their management roles to figure it out for themselves. Particularly frustrating for the unfortunate people who get stuck in their teams, as many have seen those positions to be untenable and they see their career dead ended through no fault of their own. \r\n\r\nNumerous cases of management trying to stop staff from progressing their careers internally because they haven't worked a minimum amount of time in their current role. So unless you've worked for at least two years in a department you can expect no support internally. This is particularly frustrating because these same leaders then brag about how they support career development every chance they get. \r\n\r\nFor those who want to be surrounded by great sales people you don't really get that here. This department hires grafters who are often unexperienced in sales so they'll be more malleable to management requests and required metrics.

High turnover in leadership leads to your direct manager being a coin flip. Heads and you end up in a cushy six figure job; Tails and you have a super aggressive micro-manager with no clear vision who likes to push redundant project work to implement a 12-15 hour workday. Ultimately, your career path and tenure at the company is determined by luck and which Business Unit and Manager you have.\n(For reference, I have had 3 different Managers in 7 months)\n\n2. It all starts at the top, as another reviewer pointed out - Steve Squeri is one of the worst leaders I also have seen. In one of his \"town hall\" meetings he was asked a question about compensation adjustment for 10% inflation and how it would tie in to the annual reviews, given that other companies and competitors are offering more competitive packages for their employees - to which he replied that he was perfectly fine with his employees leaving and had no interest in adjusting packages.\n\n3. The work that you are sold on during the interview may not be what you end up doing. Various teams in the organization (mine included) had their work outsourced to the point the Job Description (JD) changed completely and now these employees are stuck working on projects they did not interview for nor have any interest. This is an extremely shady practice.\n\n4. I have yet to meet one employee who smiles or sounds happy to be there. During monthly team meetings and quarterly company catchups - everyone looks burned out and exhausted. Everything else aside, this is a short coming of the leadership and what tone they set at the top.\n\n5. Another employee mentioned discriminatory practice against Caucasian employees. I can definitely attest to this and expand this to say the work culture is definitely against non-Indian employees as they appear to be the minority in the organization (as per the new hire book that gets distributed on a monthly basis). If you end up on a team that is mostly \"international\" with you being \"domestic\", you will end up on an island.\n\n6. Pay is not as competitive as the market is, especially if you are physically in the New York City office location. You can find more competitive rates with less headaches somewhere else."}], [{"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Culture Pay Benefits Flexibility Brand Reputation", "cons": "Nothing I can see now"}, {"review_title": "Great culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "10 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Sales Executive in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company with flexibility, amazing location.
