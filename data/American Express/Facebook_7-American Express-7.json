There are opportunities to grow and develop, especially if you seek them.\r\n\r\nAmerican Express has strong core values and the leadership team live by them.\r\n\r\nCompensation is comparable to other companies.  Maybe a little better...Benefits include medical, dental, vision insurance, 401K, profit sharing and a generous package of personal time off.  Employees are even allowed to purchase a week of vacation!\r\n\r\nTelecomuting is an option in many areas of the company.\r\n\r\nSkill and style of leadership varies.  But, generally, leadership is adequate.\r\n\r\nSenior company leaders are doing a good job leading the company through these hard economic times.  Yes, there have been some layoffs.  But, overall, they were handled with a high degree of sensitivity and the severance packages are better than some from other companies.\r\n\r\nTimes are tough and so is American Express!", "cons": "American Express has agressive goals (this is both good and bad).  It is good as it challenges employees to grow.  However, it makes work/life balance difficult if not impossible to acheive.  Leaders talk about the importance of work/life balance.  But, in practice, most people work 50 hours per week or more.\r\n\r\nAnother, down side of American Express, is that many jobs are being moved out of the US.  This may keep the company strong, but, it is difficult for employees.  Every year, more and more people are let go in the US.  \r\n\r\nThe compensation package and benefits are also being scaled back.  Each year, employees bear more of the cost for insurance.  This year, due to the bad economy, the company is no longer matching employee contributions to the 401K.  \r\n\r\nTimes are tough and so is American Express!"}, {"review_title": "Great people but too much red tape.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 May 2012", "job_title": "Senior Manager, Business Development in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Smart, motivated people who are great to work with.

Layoffs.  You'd be absolutely amazed by the number of people this place has let go over the past 10 years.  The pace has picked up considerably as of late with the announcement of a billion dollars in reductions.  Every meeting we are reminded of the layoffs that will be taking place well into 2017.  Thousands and thousands of employees will be out of work.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the organization is a HUGE believer in moving formerly American based positions to India.  While our Indian counterparts are smart, it's difficult to understand them and the hours are almost completely opposite.  So if you have a question or need something, it takes a full 24 hours to get a response slowing the process and adding unnecessary frustration.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have seen, the organization focuses on laying off their most tenured (expensive) employees, but what I don't understand is what message does that send your current up-and-comers?  That you work hard for 10-15-20 years and you'll be replaced by the cheaper alternative?\r\n\r\nThe organization also force ranks its employees meaning someone has to be the bottom.  So if you have a team of 10 AMAZING employees, the organization still forces the managers into ranking someone at the bottom.  The purpose of this is an ever-ready list of people to layoff at a moments notice.\r\n\r\nThe result these company practices is nothing short of a toxic workplace.  The high performers seem to be leaving in droves.  The employees who don't know if they're being laid off are upset, anxious and apathetic.  I always hear the phrase \"honestly I don't care\" when trying to get work done.  \r\n\r\nThe executives are just absolutely clueless on how to lead people.  In a townhall recently someone asked \"are you worried about great people leaving?\"  The exec's response was \"well those aren't the type of people I'd want here anyway.\"  So let me get this straight......you want people to be loyal to your organization, but your organization shows absolutely zero loyalty in return?  Please.....\r\n\r\nI began looking for work as soon as they announced the layoffs as no one (especially me) wants an uncertain future where any month could be the month I can't pay my mortgage.

While it was barely legal, it was definitely highly unethical. I consistently worked 10-12 hour days due to the volume of work assigned to me; when I tried to raise concerns about my bandwidth, I was literally told that \"[you] can't say no to any [assignments].\" \n\nWhen I informed my manager that, after careful consideration, I had applied for a move to an internally-advertised role, I was released from my job three days later with no explanation as to why. No, literally: when I asked why I was let go, my leaders responded with saying they legally didn't have to tell me why due to some fine print. \n\nAnalysts in marketing are overloaded with tedious, manual work with little to no formal training for their actual jobs within Amex. I found a dearth of clear direction on how the Analyst's actual work supports Company goals. As the Analyst is typically the most junior member of a given team, s/he is assigned responsibility for tasks no one else wants to do, such as tracking budgets and reconciling spend at end of each FY. Why assign the (arguably) least experienced member of a *marketing* team the responsibility of accounting for millions of dollars when they're usually not hired for / trained to do actual accounting? \n\nOverall, I heard from colleagues that I had a uniquely poor experience in my time at American Express. Many feel the company is a great place to work, and I was excited to join the company for the same reasons. Unfortunately, that was not my experience, and I feel I would be remiss not to warn candidates who are considering applying to work there.

For the past few decades all they have done is launch various fancy looking credit cards but failed to think of ways to revive/innovate the modes of payments. I mean, it took companies like Paypal, Apple, Samsung to come up with innovative ideas to make payments.\r\n\r\n The top leadership consists of people who graduated from various unrelated streams like English literature, psychology and were probably classmates with Bob Hope and obviously think the best way to cut down on expenses is to lay off people or move departments to India. The people who are laid off are usually the band 35\u2019s and lower. The VPs who generally are band 45s and up  remain unaffected. Not to forget, there are several layers of VPs. There are more VPs in a department (band levels ranging from 45 to 65) than the people who are actually hands on and working.\r\n\r\nComing to the technologies at Amex, it does not matter if you spent a good part of your life getting education (a BS and an MS in CS), you would be reporting to directors who are not even from the engineering background (being a BS and an MS in Computer Science from an accredited University in USA, I reported to a director who had a Pharmacy background and had nothing to do with computer science/technology). Kudos to the legal team to even justify his H1-B managing engineers. If you want see the H1-B abuse, you should work at Amex. People with textile engineering background are on H1-B and working as Lead architects.\r\n\r\nYou get promoted only if you are the favorite of your VP and you don\u2019t question any of your leader\u2019s authority. I have seen couples working as VPs (both husband and wife are VP) in the same technologies department, reporting to the same Senior VP, not sure how have they been able to fool the system. Don\u2019t even get me started on the contractor culture.\r\nThey hire contractors from companies you have never ever heard of. For some contractors there are layers of contract companies behind. Most of the contractors cant even speak English properly leave alone writing elegant piece of code.\r\n\r\nMost of your time on a daily basis is spent typing emails to other teams that you are collaborating with on a platform. No body/team really owns up if something breaks/needs fixes. You will end up spending most of your time trying to explain the flaw and ultimately things get done only if you CC your VP in the email. God forbids if you are trying to get access to a system. It took me over 5 weeks to upload images on an internal image hosting server since I didn\u2019t have access to it. Your access requests need approvals from not only your manager but a couple of VPs.\r\n\r\nIn the name of cultural events they celebrate Indian festivals,  perhaps a no brainer since Indians are the majority here. Never could really comprehend, how doing a fashion show in funny looking Indian outfits was celebrating Asian culture. Come on now, there are so many other countries in Asia. \r\n\r\nEvery VP conducts a quarterly town hall. You can imagine the amount of time you waste attending those, given each department has a dozen VPs. And did I mention the presentation is more or less the same. I have been to town halls where they play videos of some south Indian/bollywood actor, now being a non Indian/asian not really sure what am I suppose to do with that or what has that got to do with quarterly town halls? \r\nAt the technologies they even host some award functions. Somehow for the 3 years I have been there, I see the same handful folks sweep all the awards. The funniest part is, the same guy can win a platinum reward, gold reward and silver as well. Can Hussain bolt win the gold, silver and bronze at once??"}, {"review_title": "Director", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "11 May 2018", "job_title": "Program Director in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexibility and work life balance , great culture and strong brand.

When you are hired, you are told that this is not just a job; it's a career and that you are now here for life...you are now PART OF THE FAMILY. You are given the impression that you are a permanent employee from day one. Unfortunately, that is not the case.\r\n\r\nYou must go through a training process and instead of basing your permanent hire on how well you did in the training program or how well you grasp the systems or procedures.  No... your permanent hire is based on two things:  1) how much you kiss up to the management training team because you final hire rest solely in their hands and has nothing to do with your skills or performance; and 2) surveys that you receive in a very, very flawed system. You will receive bad surveys from card members you never even talked to or regarding issues like...American Express making a corporate decision to remove an airport lounge access which has nothing to do with the service you provided that card member, just their dissatisfaction with a corporate decision that you took no part in but YOU will get that bad survey and they will constantly tell you that there is nothing they can do about you now being stuck with that bad survey although they listen to those calls and know that it had nothing to do with you but that one bad survey may very well keep you from getting a permanent hire. Also, keep in mind that in order to wipe out 1 bad survey, you must get at least 5 excellent surveys...yeah, that math makes no sense to me either. Additionally, with the mess they have with the company that manages their surveys, your surveys are sometimes held for 10 days and when 1 bad survey and only two good surveys in a week can destroy your possibility of being permanent, you can understand that they holding surveys back can affect you in the worse way.  But remember...this all revert back to #1...if you didn't make good surveys but you kissed plenty of training management butt or if you're a man...YOUR GOLDEN!!!\r\n\r\nTheir system frankly makes no sense because they spend all this money on background checks, training, paying into your benefits from day one, etc. and pay you a good salary just to walk 50% of a training class out of the bldg. based on surveys that you have no control over and have nothing to do with the customer service you actually provided. Someone at the top either doesn't know these dumb business decisions are being made or they just don't care to realize that this can only serve to breakdown what was once an amazing company to be a part of.\r\n\r\nYou are even required to select your health insurance within 60 days of hire although you may very well be walked out of the bldg within the next three months and ultimately be left with no health insurance whatsoever because you cancelled the insurance you had prior to working there and now after Obamacare, you can't get it back.\r\n\r\nAlso, remember all the above if you are considering leaving a permanent position you currently have to take a job with American Express. You may be leaving something solid for a very, VERY shaky possibility. Do you really want to risk your security that you've worked hard at, on the luck of the draw? The grass isn't always greener on the other side is absolutely applicable when considering a position with American Express. It's unfortunate because every actual permanent employee I spoke with told me it was an excellent place to work but again, to actually get to that point you have to walk on hot coals and glass. It's all a matter of luck and being liked by the training management and not experience or skill, which in the long run only serves to hurt the company and its card members.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you are female; are even remotely attractive; are slimmer than the training management and/or you happen to dress more professionally or fashionably than the actual training management staff, they resent you and they will use this to hinder your final hire.  After your first orientation day, no matter how cute or fashionable you may see some of the trainers dressed and believe me, some of them wore skirts so short the queen waved...DRESS DOWN...DON'T WEAR MAKEUP...NO BRIGHT COLOR...NO NAILS...KEEP YOUR HAIR AS PLAIN AS YOU CAN...NO HEELS...NOTHING FASHIONABLE...IF YOU'RE SKINNY, WEAR VERY LOSE CLOTHES...IF YOU ARE EVEN REMOTELY ATTRACTIVE, PLAY IT WAY DOWN...DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT WILL RUFFLE THE MANAGEMENT TEAM BITTIES because that will be the end of you!!!!

An example of this intimidation is the trainerss telling our class that management can fire you for any thing at anytime.

Outdated technology (In Travel and Lifestyle Services).  All GDS systems are old (developed in the 60's) and require an extensive code input system.  However, as long as you know the correct code to imput, they work.  However, American Express created an overlay developed 20 yearss ago that crashes as frequently as every call you receive. I might be the only one bothered by this as I am have a degree in computer science,  and I will note that it appears as though they are working to come up with a new system.  In the mean time when the sytem crashes you still are expected to make the entire reservation in the amount of time alloted.  They use metrics to measure performance (as all call centers do).  The technology they use to measure metrics is very good.  \r\n\r\nYou do get a bonus, however, your bonus is structured in a way that you will almost never recieve it.  The bonus is only received if you make a 9-10 on every survey customer's return.  Which is not a problem, however if you get a 1 because the person the card member spoke with before you was rude.  It still counts against you.  Management will tell you not to ever expect a bonus. \r\n\r\nAlso, it appears as though the company does not let you transfer into another position very easily.  Most people with a bachelor's degree are still stuck in the same call center environment 10 years later.  \r\n\r\nIf you're a recent college grad (like myself) looking to get your foot in the door at a large company, this is not the job for you.  \r\n\r\nIf you are a person who is looking to take advantage of the work from home positions that American Express offers for this position, This job may be for you.

AXP is everything you would expect in a shrinking workforce full of desperate hangers on trying to compete with everyone around them in order to position themselves to avoid getting laid off as the stock and company spiral.   H1B visa program is used to the maximum to displace long term, competent and dedicated employees to satisfy short-term financial goals. Do not plan to retire there.  There is a rank 'em and yank 'em mentality where excellent, invaluable employees are being let go because they have to make excuses to get rid of people to save money.   I think ENRON invented that process & we all know what happened to them. This 'culture change' AXP is embarking on is simply barefaced outsourcing program which is bringing people into the US on the visa program, which would not be so bad if the people they hired had talent, but most only have one major attribute - being cheap. This 'financial engineering' is akin to giving yourself cancer to lose weight, or a surgeon removing vital organs and replacing them with newspaper stuffing.  Many people over the last decade, with the sharpest skills and inventive minds that covered lots of critical capability and those recently laid off engineers with talent immediately end up working for competitors, which are undeniably now 'eating Amex's lunch' all thanks to the ingenious employee shedding practices AXP engages in.  Yet AXP leadership is bewildered why they are facing headwinds.  If you are an exempt salaried employee, to compete and fight to stay on, expect to wake up around 6:30am and immediately start reading email, the conference calls begin at the same time you are supposed to getting your kids ready for and taking them to school. Meanwhile the company  touts 'work life balance' and 'family values' but you don't get angry about that, because wisely you instead save your energy because you  know you will need it for the frequent after-hours work that you get to perform from home dialed in with your laptop, with no overtime pay.  Saturday became a regular work day, and all of it was absolutely thankless, just expected. Directors have it even worse, with blackberry pages and calls around the clock. AXP offers a generous 2+weeks of vacation, but do the math - you will work two weeks of OT during your first month there and will continue to provide OT every month for the remainder of your dubious tenure - There is pressure for innovation which on its face is an admirable and desirable goal, but what it originates from is the desperation from the top leaders in the company to somehow find an 'Uber - like'  magical fix to recover ground to competitors."}, {"review_title": "Home based CCP", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Jan 2016", "job_title": "HOME BASED SERVICE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome company to work for, great benefits, everyone is eager to help if you don't know an answer, they are very encouraging to their employees, bonuses are awesome, pay is great, great vacation package, 5 weeks off a year, hours are very flexible", "cons": "I don't like working weekends but I'm new so it's to be expected but I'm able to trade with other employees to get days off."}, {"review_title": "Great Company for A Type Pesonalities", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Lead Technical Architect in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Really enjoyed my time at Amex.

There are the usual seasonal parties, and various sporting and cultural associations to be a part of.

Senior leaders have zero people management skills - despite the fact that most managers are working 80 hours/week, the Directors and VPs constantly berate the team for not working hard enough (while they leave at 5PM on the dot).  Additionally, we spend the majority of our time fixing system and data issues which have existed for years (and is not actually part of our jobs) - meaning the people that are currently VPs are the ones that made the mistakes and are not taking any accountability for it.  All they do is blame us, even though we didn't create the problems and we're working twice the amount of hours they are to fix it.

(You can check the mail trail for all the mail communications happened.)\r\n\r\nI was promised(on call) by my leader that the amount will be credited by 25th April 2015. Even this didn't happened.\r\n\r\nSo, I spoke to Payroll India yesterday on call and they informed me that they received information about the shift allowance only on 17th April 2015 and as the cut-off date was 14th April 2015 hence they could not process in April's payroll. Now the dues will now be credited in May's payroll.\r\n\r\nI sent my first mail after checking FFS statement to my leaders on 10th March 2015. I am finding very hard to understand why this took so long to process even when this is known that the amount is pending for more than a year.\r\n\r\nAnd, Now I cannot wait for another payroll for my payout as I have some commitments and also I am not able to trust that this will be done in May as well.\r\n\r\nI am stressed as this was never expected from such a large and reputed organisation."}, {"review_title": "Bi-lingual is best!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "22 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Credit Analyst in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Paid time off, personal days, flex days, RRSP matching, pension, benefits.\r\nAnnual wage increase.

The reality is that leadership doesn't listen to customers or employees and is extremely slow to recognize, respond to, or fix known issues. It takes years, literally, to fix even the smallest glitches. The money invested in new technology must be minuscule as we use ancient PCs and our work takes twice as long as it should due to PC loading issues, slow internet, constant server disconnects, etc., smh. Amex supposedly 'encourages new ideas', and on-the-job learning, but has an unspoken policy that it be done off the clock (e.g. compulsory trainings must be done, but no time is allowed off the phones to do them, etc.). Breaks/lunches have to be cut short in order to meet abusive ATS goals. There is extreme micro-management and pressure from above at all times. Low and mid-level management spend eons of time micro-managing and critiquing calls but zero time addressing blatant failed Amex processes, botched accounts, and cardmember situations which require personalized handling versus rulebook procedures.

These are written largely by the blissfully unaware. Sure, if you're under 35 years old, you have a chance to be happy at Amex for a little while (until you realize that you're doing the work of three people, with nearly impossible-to-meet goals). There is ZERO job security because Amex is completely un-innovative and seeks to cut costs by sacrificing the employees that had nothing to do with losing major contracts like JetBlue and Costco (how long before the last big hold-out, Delta Airlines, realizes they're still partnered with an outdated soul-less dinosaur)? Until you do get laid off, be prepared to be reviewed annually (actually twice a year, because you have to write your own \"mid-year\" as well) based in huge part on customer surveys. That would be ok except for the fact that customers are asked questions about experiences over which you have no control or were even a part of. How blatantly unfair. Also, be prepared to work for a team leader who is dumb as a bag of hammers. If you work in Fort Lauderdale, you know who you are - you may have been fooling those above you all these years, but you've never fooled those of us who work under you!  I had in excess of 15 different team leaders (management confuses shuffling people around with employee development) and MAYBE two or three of them had any knowledge (or ability for that matter) to do the job of the people they supervised. Some of the other review writers here seem to think that those of us who had direct customer interface were treated well. I don't know where that idea comes from because Amex treated all band 25 employees at our location like yesterday's garbage and the Fort Lauderdale location is very heavy on customer contact. (I spoke to 20+ Cardmembers daily). \r\nAlso, if you like attending endless mindless meetings, you'll love working at Amex. I can't tell you the number of countless, tortuous hours spent listening to some dumb dumb or another drone on with their artificial \"I'm so happy I work here\" face on, designed solely to impress whatever dumb dumb they report to, none of whom dare rock the boat with any original thoughts; that would be too risky. You can read it on every one of their faces, \"God, just let me not be in the next round of layoffs....\" \r\nAmerican Express first lost it's way back in the 70s from what I understand. They were too cocky with their \"we're all that\" attitude. They did manage to get back on track but they still coast on their artificial reputation. They no longer provide exceptional customer service, which was the thing that differentiated them all these years. It's now done mostly \"offshore\" by non-Americans who use the short time they intend to be with the company as a resume builder and couldn't care less about Amex or its customers and who, by the way, severely lack integrity and work ethic. So it's no surprise that the JD Powers award has gone to Discover the last few years, after having been given to Amex for the prior 8 or 10 years (I forget how many in a row, but a HUGE deal was made of winning it every year, all the big wigs patting one another on the back for a job well done, while pretending to give us low levels all the credit by handing out cupcakes on the big day. Golly! Thanks!). Suddenly, when Discover realized that one great way to win the hearts of their customers is to get the word out that when you call them, you'll get a US-based (translation: American) representative, along with the fact that there's not one good reason in the world to use a Card with an annual fee (a substantial part of Amex's customer portfolio), the JD Powers award is barely whispered about in the halls of the Amex building I worked in, other than by us lowly band 25s who frankly giggled our butts off about it since we knew we were on the chopping block anyway. \r\nSince Amex let me go, I'm having trouble paying my credit card bills. I've prioritized which will get paid and which won't. I find bitter justice in the fact that I'm going to pay off my Discover Card but not my Amex.

There's no exit interview for employees who are leaving and they don't even have the right to mention the reason for resigning. The director will write whatever reason he wants. There's nobody an employee can go to if the director isn't listening to his or her problems. \r\n\r\n6.
