The medical and especially the dental policies are great plans.  Up to 6% match on 401K.  There are downtown Boston locations near the T.  When you leave State Street for the day you never have to complete work in the evenings and/or weekends as the market is closed.", "cons": "Again, this review is for State Street\u2019s back office fund accounting and custody positions of which the vast majority are labeled  \u201cfund accountant, portfolio accountant, or account controller.\u201d  If you have a BA or BS,  State Street should be considered as a last resort if you are desperate for a job.  \r\n\r\nWait, what about the logic that says State Street looks great on a resume and you need to get experience and then you can get into something better?!  Fact is, it is very rare to move from the back office to the front office unless you have something more going for you than just back office experience.  (The majority of those who left and landed much higher paying jobs outside of the back office had business/economics/finance degrees, were working towards grad degrees, or showed a rapid promotion pace at State Street coupled with strong analysis, communication, and people skills.)   Also, by taking a starting salary of $32K, you are seriously anchoring your salary.  State Street back office jobs are the most numerous private sector jobs in Boston so other employers can easily find what you make and many employers already know that the job is just repetitive and tedious data entry done primarily on proprietary State Street systems.  State Street\u2019s MCH accounting system is from 1986 and uses green and black colors and you simply memorize data entry sequences that usually utilize combinations of four letter codes, F10, and enter.  In a given morning you will be processing hundreds if not thousands of these data entry sequences.  In the afternoons you will spend most of your time checking numbers to make sure they match up.  You will also use Excel 2003 for data entry.  You will also use Excel for sorting data and pivot tables.  Many workers listen to music through headphones during the day so that tells you quite a bit about the nature of the work.  \r\n\r\nManagers say learning about the business and helping others are the two real keys to advancing and generally I agree.  However, what that means is that the people who can enter data and run the ten keys the fastest are then able to help others out.  I don\u2019t care what your abilities and strengths are; if you are not one of the fastest in your group on the ten key and on the keyboard you most likely will never get promoted.  \r\n\r\nAnother point that can\u2019t be overemphasized is how little State Street cares about its workers.  You are just a number.  I was interviewed with a group and then just asked a few general questions by two managers and hired the next week.  Your performance reviews consist of managers filling out checklists saying you meet goals 99% of the time or more and you will get four to five short sentences a year of general feedback.  The next year managers may change one sentence or two and give  you your updated review.   Only managers and above get flat panel monitors so you will spend time squinting and straining your eyes on old school monitors from the 1990s.  As the economy grows turnover is once again returning to its high pace.  State Street does not even care about an exit interview when you resign, they just send you a survey email.  \r\n  \r\nIf you are in a group that has a lot of people leave, (which is very common), you may be able to advance to a senior and manager in a short time, but you will still be making less than many newly minted college grads.  Starting pay is $32K while seniors make $36K and both roles are eligible for OT.  However, it is very common for groups to say you are not allowed to bill for OT so you end up working all through lunch without pay.  It was very common for my group to eat in about ten minutes at our desks while managers said make sure you are not billing OT for when you are eating at your desk.  Managers start at $45K on salary while Officers start at $53K on salary.  Again, not a lot of money when you consider the 2.5-3.5 years to make manager and the 5 years plus (if you advance really fast), to make officer. \r\n\r\nA key factor about State Street is shown by their response to high turnover rates.  See the Boston Business Journal 9/8/2008 for an article about State Street and the Year Up Program in which State Street trains and hires current community college students who are working towards their associate degrees.  If you have a bachelor\u2019s degree why would you want the same job for the same pay?!  In fact, you will even find just high school grads on the floor as well.  \r\n\r\nAlso, many workers at State Street lack basic written English skills.  The emails sent are downright embarrassing and it is obvious these folks could not get hired at any other company.  I understand that English is your second language but you need to take classes and improve it to grow your career.  Client  communications were often downright embarrassing and this is the image that State Street projects.\r\n\r\nYour opinion does not matter.  Your suggestions do not matter.  All managers care about is that you make deadlines with no mistakes.  Our workloads were consistently increased and when deadlines were repeatedly missed by the group, management simply said no excuses.  We often had meetings every few weeks when things were not going well and it was just an opportunity for managers to put on shows to the officers and AVPs.  State Street\u2019s corporate culture does a great job of \u201cpitting\u201d managers against the \u201cproblems\u201d within their groups.  It was not uncommon to see managers outright lie and blame others whenever an Officer,  AVP,  or SVP was upset with a mistake that was made.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, most of competent people do not stay very long at State Street and they go on to much more lucrative and rewarding careers while the weaker workers stay.  The key is to have a plan and understand your role at State Street in the broader context.  Despite the nature of the work, it is very high risk and if you can talk about responsibility and how you fit in the asset management, accounting/custody, and client service picture you will be on your way.  Remember, nobody outside of State Street cares that you know 129 MCH functions!\r\n\r\nNow, I highly recommend that you do a little research on your own.  Go the Lafayette Corporate Center (across from the Paramount Theater) and observe the three revolving doors at the State Street sign.  How are workers dressed?  How do they present themselves?  Next, leave the LCC and walk over to Boston\u2019s financial district and observe workers there and compare and contrast.  You will see where you want to be in financial services.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering State Street use it as a last resort and have a plan.  If you currently work there start exploring other options right now and have a clear exit plan.  I can\u2019t overemphasize how easy it is to get pigeon-holed and stuck in back office operations if you do not have a clear and quick exit plan."}, {"review_title": "Good company for career starter", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 May 2011", "job_title": "Senior Accountant in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Good company culture\r\n- Good benefits\r\n- Most of people are nice to work with\r\n- Offer new grads opportunaties to start the career;\r\n- Good company for career starter", "cons": "- Be prepared to work overtime( you get paid for overtime)\r\n- Salary is relatively low comparing to same position in our companies\r\n- High turn over due to low salary\r\n- Can be stressful sometimes due to different deadlines"}, {"review_title": "Great!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Jun 2011", "job_title": "Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "learn a ton\r\ncareer growth good\r\nhours are great\r\nwork life balance is fantastic\r\nteam work environment is great to work in", "cons": "hard place ot work if you dont have any background in the feild.\r\nPromotion time line is a bit ridiculous\r\npushing paperwork\r\nvery repetitive but helps you learn"}, {"review_title": "Great place to build ones knowledge base but mediocre pay.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Feb 2012", "job_title": "Portfolio Administrator", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great use of technology\r\nKnowledgeable associates\r\nGreat managers (easy to work with)\r\nVery friendly and diverse work environment", "cons": "State Street is a good place to work but there is an issue that is hindering the company from being a great place to work.

The company doesn't care about its employees (though they pretend to, of course). It's next to impossible to actually develop a career - the best you can do is make endless lateral moves. Promotions are decided by senior managers who are too far above the candidates to even know who they're promoting. I once witnessed a c-suite executive state in a town hall meeting, \"If you haven't gotten a promotion, you just haven't worked hard enough,\" which is completely inappropriate, offensive, and totally out of touch with how things actually work in his company. Pay is far below industry standard, to the point that a recruiter once burst out laughing when I told him what my bonus was. They will make any possible excuse to minimize or completely eliminate your annual 2% raise and tiny bonus. I have listened to Jay Hooley talk about great annual results, announce a 25% dividend increase and a $600 million share buyback, and then, in the same breath, tell his employees that no one will get a raise this year because there isn't enough money for it. Also, due to this same \"lack of money,\" critical and unfinished projects around the company will be underfunded or have their budgets completely eliminated. But at least the shareholders got theirs.\r\n\r\nThere is no internal culture; people are miserable and either resigned to a lifetime at State Street or looking to leave. There is an annual quota of layoffs. Every single year the board decides how many people they're going to fire, and the layoffs get distributed across the company, with every group required to fire their share. Of course, annually this is described as an unfortunate measure the company didn't want to take, but it's very much a part of yearly planning. Work-life balance is highly dependent on where you work and to whom you report. Infrastructure is a joke, with employees forced to work on computers 10+ years old and no way to replace them. The management committee endlessly talks about things like innovation, corporate culture and the new \"The Way Ahead\" campaign, while everyone down in the trenches know none of it has any meaning and will lead to absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nDo not work for this company."}, {"review_title": "Associate 2", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Feb 2017", "job_title": "Associate II in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Work Life balance - I have more paid time off than anyone I know.

Some bother me more than others and should bother anyone associated with this company.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is a disconnect between the company vision and reality. The vision is (currently) 'Beacon'- cutting costs through effective technology. The reality is this place is too cheap and too ignorant (sorry) to make  it happen. \r\n\r\nThey offshore so much of their tech labor, turn over labor at a pace I've never seen anywhere else, work with the most Frankenstein patchwork of old technology which faced the brink of catastrophic failure daily, have barely any clue how this mess works together, continue to add pie in the sky projects (to look good to shareholders, I'm guessing) but can't spring for the greatest, much less the latest anything.  I can't see them NOT having a serious catastrophic data crash within the next five years.\r\n\r\nLet's not forget the tech side doesn't communicate well with the business side so neither are happy with one another.\r\n\r\nSecurity, while necessary, makes many tasks almost impossible. For example, if you step in today, it'll likely take you at least two weeks before you can use a computer, even if they know you're coming on board several months in advance.\r\n\r\nTraining is non-existent and one of the lowest priorities of any department, mainly because the departments are mostly understaffed and trying to both keep things running AND put out fires constantly. \r\n\r\nWhen I think about the company, I envision a group of people in a fast moving car falling apart on the highway, and rather than stop  to fix the mess, they'd rather get people out on the hood with a toolbox and pray things just keep running without anyone noticing.\r\n\r\nDid I mention they haven't had a good product since SPDR's? They are cheap to a fault yet they think things like putting a statue of a girl in front of the Wall Street bull is the best move for business.\r\n\r\nAnd the internal communications...  the company prides itself on it's pride. It's always doing the right thing; communications say so. Never mind the low pay. Never mind being thrown into projects no normal human being could ever hope to solve. Never mind the feeling that there are two state streets: Boston and everyone else- just go along with the pitch. Things are great.

Also, internal promotions systems are very backward.  HR has incentives to hire outside (higher placement fees) and your rating is completely subject to your manager.

Unfortunately new college students and the overly ambitious believe that State Street is a great stepping stone into the financial world hoping to reach the magic lands of \u201cSSGA\u201d (the investing arm of State Street). \r\n\r\nUnfortunately that is no longer the case, as recruiters from several large companies have stated that they have streams of resumes from State Street looking for greener pasture it has become a daunting task to review all these resumes and find individuals with the skill set that they are looking for. The other problem with State Street applicants is the skill level is hard to ascertain due to the lack of consistency in the training of individuals and diversity of clients and groups. Exposure to learning is relative to the funds and technology that is provided within an individual group within the company. You will see a mix of individuals who will post every entry from hand to individuals who only know how to hit several buttons within a macro. Lack of consistency leads employers to shy away from some candidates in fear of being burned for hiring an employee who does not even understand the basic principles of GAAP. Once the great stepping stone, State Street has become a vortex to keeping young talent from advancement.\r\n\r\nCompensation in State Street is rather poor compared to its competitors, due to strategy per HR and upper level management. Upper level management has decided to mandate a 40 hour work week lunch not included. As a response to this outrage, the company has increased wages of non-exempt employees which were originally cut but has failed to compensate exempt employees which leads to unfair wage increases for some and none for others. This leads to a problem with experienced workers getting paid less than non experienced employees. Think of the NFL and how Sam Bradford got a higher contract than Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. Upper level management has responded with the response that exempt employees were responsible for completing their work no matter how many hours so they do not need additional compensation. They also have responded to employees by saying that their decisions could not make everyone happy and it is a tough economy trying to challenge employees to look for new positions in a tough economy. But sadly, even with the increase for the exempt employees their compensation is significantly lower than their peers with the same experience and same position.\r\n\r\nUpper Level Management has worked its hardest to change the direction of this company. This company is working on control expenses by any means necessary, from their failed project to incorporate all their funds into India or trying to move the fund accounting work into Kansas city, to trying to encourage a 40 hour work week without compensating their already underpaid staff. If you believe in a winning company, this is the company for you bar the fact that the only one who will be winning is the company. But you will have a safe job until the company decides you make too much money and the layoffs every 2-5 years occur to get rid of you."}, {"review_title": "Miserable", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Feb 2012", "job_title": "Professional Button Pusher, Excel Monkey and Cubicle Dweller in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They will hire you when nobody else will.

The higher you go, the more incompetent the people are.  And there is no way to climb the ladder based on merit alone....you have to kiss you-know-what in order to get noticed.  Extremely hierarchical structure....most SVPs won't take meetings even with VPs that don't report directly to them.  Senior management, which has recently been overhauled with former consultants, is cutting costs to the bone, which translates to awful tech support and rolling layoffs.   It's pretty fun coming in the last Wednesday of every month not knowing if you're going to be in the unemployment line or back at your desk the next morning .  The push is still to offshore a lot of work, while it has been proven through experience that the offshore partner cannot handle anything other than simple tasks.  Regarding salary...it is not good.  The company pays approximately 3% more in starting salary than it did in the year 2000, and management's excuse is that \"we're in line with our competition\".   Two problems....A) that's a bold faced lie and B) even if it wasn't, management obviously isn't paying attention to a little issue we have in this country called wealth inequality (which actually makes sense, thinking back to my previous comment about incompetence levels rising the higher up the org chart you go).  Then we're told that the SVP level and above have their pay frozen so that the \"little people\" can still get a 2.5% merit increase....guess what, nobody feels bad for a class of people who average over 200K in salary and God knows how much more in bonus/shares.  Other reviewers have mentioned the SSB brand name as being a pro...I couldn't disagree more.  Rumors have been around for years of other financial firms in the city throwing away SSB resumes before even reading them.  Once you're here for more than a couple years, buckle up, you're likely here until your number gets called.

An interesting program is \"belt\" - karate belts. You pass the exam and get a white belt, then yellow, blue, green, etc.\r\n\r\nCollaboration is very difficult with a senior. If you have any \"break\" or \"crue\" - these are daily reports, in which there are incorrect postings or unknown postings, know that you are waiting for help. Either you solve the problem yourself or you have to wait 40 days or longer. Work is a headache, the officer will tell you that he has a lot of work, other clients and cannot just think about your client. However, if you make a mistake, it is your fault or how many \"errors\" there are - \"break\". It is an endless circle of negative experiences.\r\n\r\nThe worst is rush, work on time, you have only 30 minutes to complete the task, and here the computer is slow, people are talking around, you have to train another person on the way, someone writes something to you in chat, you can get split.\r\n\r\nNobody cares that you have a family, your own life, only the results count.\r\n\r\nI hit it bad, there are bands where it's better, however, there is time pressure in each team.\r\n\r\nIt is better not to talk too much about open space, because it is a flea market of gossip, they talk about each other, it is very sad. Even superiors laugh at subordinates and their behavior.\r\n\r\nPlus every Tuesday apples and bananas that disappear in 1 hour. :)"}, {"review_title": "Do your homework before you accept at job here", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 May 2010", "job_title": "Fund Accountant in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A flexible work schedule is appreciated at State Street Back and Trust.
