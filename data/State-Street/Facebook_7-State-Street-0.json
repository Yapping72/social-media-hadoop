Every month process/timeline changes as new thought comes in senior's mind. They want you to finish whole month's work in one day suddenly as their thoughts are changing continuously.\r\n5.

Their friend/relative get good rating & promotion and easy access to them and you get downgrade rating and it does not matter whatever you have done.\r\n13.

Consequently, huge chasms in abilities are created - seriously impacting the company's level of service to its customers.\n\nThe culture at the company has changed dramatically for the worse over the last few years, particularly under the leadership of the current CFO.

Management couldn't seem to understand why we were making so many mistakes at that point. I had to be online until the files go out, which could be as late as midnight. On top of that my client complained about my WFH once so management took away my WFH privilege (this was happened in 2018/2019). I wouldn't want to work here if my employer couldn't even protect my own interests. I left soon after that happened.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of finger pointing blaming culture here during my time there and teams are put into silos. Everyone follows their Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and won't think flexibly to make the process better.\r\n\r\nThere's plenty of diversity at entry level. However I could tell there weren't a lot of minority representations once you hit the VPs/MDs/EVP levels and above."}]]
