The computers are connected to servers in Edinburgh and London and you need to transmit every process done locally, meaning some easy tasks may take a long time to be done.

They are given a budgets and deadlines to complete projects but cant hire the staffing (contract or FTE) to meet the deadlines.  When a rec (contact/ fte) is approved we need to use a preferred vendor (Wipro, which the majority are Indian) and find a candidate that can actually know the work.  SSB has manipulated most of their code, so many new contractors have a 2-3 month learning curve.  Once we get them fully trained they are typically let go.  It is torture for the employees trying to pick up the slack.  ALL of the people that I deal with are working 50-60 hours a week with no overtime and all are salaried.

There are great managers on certain teams that acknowledge their team\u2019s efforts and that promote people pretty well. Work-from-home is allowed and encouraged by certain teams, and many people even spend most of the week working remotely. This benefit is certainly helpful for those with long commutes. \r\n\r\nThere are also plenty of friendly people throughout the company despite the low morale within many departments. Working with team members in another country, even through remote communication, does provide insights into another culture. Despite the controversy with offshoring, I have found my offshore team members to be friendly and to be just as capable as onshore members once they have been brought up to speed. Any differences in work quality is mostly due to inexperience with specific procedures or clients within this firm as some onshore members have been working in their roles for multiple years. Of course, there have been issues especially with teams being overburdened with training and client complaints in regards to the drop in experience level on teams, but honestly, clients have had plenty to complain about even before this transition.\r\n\r\nIf you are fine with working in investment servicing at a custodian bank, then State Street is likely the better place to be over its competitors in terms of work flexibility and benefits. The company has a good amount of networking groups and social events.", "cons": "If you are in Global Services, then the work is very tedious, and you will become well acquainted with copying and pasting. The teams are also broken down into narrow silos, which limits opportunities and creates frustration in getting resources. Adding in tensions or lack of communication between teams, the situation certainly exacerbates issues with work quality.\r\n\r\nMany teams rely on offshore contractor teams that are given the grunt work and even narrower tasks. As they are considered contractors, they miss out on the benefits given to regular State Street employees. These factors cause high turnover within their teams which places heavier workloads on the teams reliant on them. This situation has been causing frustration throughout the company, yet management is somehow still confused as to why the contractor teams have been performing poorly. \r\n\r\nThe workload for many teams is heavy due to delays in resources caused by the dependencies mentioned above combined with low staffing levels and the fact that multiple clients still expect work delivered on schedule. This may be nothing new to the corporate world, but with the mind-numbing work, it certainly takes away time that can be better spent for all of those involved.\r\n\r\nRestrictions due to the sensitivity of financial information causes so many headaches due to access issues to certain applications or resources. The reliance on macros to pull information does not help this situation as often my team gets stuck not being able to pull data due to an access restriction. Also, macros become useless when data sources are changed or when they become obsolete, and a manual workaround is often needed. Good luck getting something resolved that cannot be done remotely through the offshore call centers. \r\n\r\nThe elephant in the room at this company has been the low morale due to layoffs or \u201credeployments\u201d from offshoring, due to heavy workloads as mentioned above and due to general disconnect between upper management\u2019s decisions and the rest of the employees. Again, this is not something unique to State Street, especially within its industry, but does not make the situation any less of a con.\r\n\r\nWorking in the Global Services division, you are far away from the actual investment decision-making processes and tend to get pigeonholed into operations and fund accounting roles if you want to leave. If you have dreams of working in an interesting industry or working in an investment management role, then look to avoid or at least minimize your time here.

The stem of the problem from talking to people (and what I say to others) is that the company just doesn't value it's employees. \r\n\r\nThe nature of the work varies, but 90% of it is data entry and troubleshooting the ancient processes/hardware.

Training tends to be more along the lines of sitting next to the person working, watching them work while they're explaining everything to you and then you're on your own in 2-3 days. If you're starting out as an A2 there are not that many courses that you can take to prepare for the role and it does feel as if you're on your own for the first couple weeks/months. Be prepared to have everything thrown at you all at once.\r\n- I also wish I could say that training is great but it really isn't and they've supposedly revamped it within the past couple years and it just feels like it's getting worse.\r\n- Orientation was just 45 minutes unless if you're in another department then you have some sort of special 3-day training and getting to know the company. But if you're in Corporate Actions you have to report back to your desk and work.\r\n- Software that they use are not that ascetically pleasing. Also it's true what other reviewers have mentioned here, the skills are not really transferable and only applicable to State Street. \r\n- It is hard trying to become an Officer or get promoted to being an officer and usually takes a while, perhaps more than 5 years in the department.\r\n- With regards to promotion, I've heard of too many stories about biases in promotions to being a Senior Associate so be prepared to work a lot and not get any credit for it or very little recognition.  \r\n- Don't expect too much from working at the Quincy, MA location. They don't give cups in the breakroom (you have to bring your own). Also includes paper plates, bowls, etc. Plastic utensils and condiments are located far on the 2nd floor cafeteria. \r\n- Convenience store takes cash only. Strange how they sell lottery scratch tickets here. \r\n- The building looks nice from the outside but don't let that deceive you. Exterior renovations were completed in 2015, interior renovations were completed around 2005-2006. It kind of gets old after a while. \r\n- If you are paid less than 40k as an Associate 2 in Corporate Actions, you are definitely being underpaid. \r\n- Many people tend to stay within the company for many years as they have either gotten too comfortable to move to other jobs or have little prospects elsewhere. Also the company does tend to pigeon-hole employees starting with three weeks vacations and great health benefits. Many managers will even promote A2s to Senior Associate positions just to keep employees in the company. If you do get promoted, I would try to leave a few months in. \r\n- Good luck spending an hour with the help desk with setting up your printer.\r\n- Understand that small mistakes and errors do cost the company money but even simply forgetting something and then asking your co-worker how to do something really small that it left your head (because you've learned so much!) can explode into a long hour-long conversation about how to essentially do your job. I guess happens at almost every workplace.\r\n- People have different ways of training, some more advanced than others, no one keeps it simple here. Personalities differ with everyone here but at least it keeps things interesting. \r\n- The time and a half overtime is great but they are cracking down on OT and some managers are very picky about the amount of hours you enter in. Also be aware that some Senior Associates do not get OT if you are in other departments. But Corporate Actions does.\r\n- Overall, it's a good place to start but I wouldn't stay there for more than a couple years. Less than that is fine. If you're expecting cool, hip things (similar to a start-up workplace) like beer cart on Thursdays, a ping pong table, gym, etc, then you're out of luck. The workspace is mostly just get-in-get-out. Everyone becomes passive after a while and I've unfortunately become that way too. Also it's business casual clothing or anything with a collar, I wouldn't try to wear sneakers as I've gotten flagged down for that before.\r\n- Bathrooms seriously need renovations.\r\n- Paper towels on the 5th floor do not usually get stocked until by around 11am to noon but on the 3rd floor, they're full stocked and ready-to-go. I feel that the maintenance workers get lazy sometimes. At a time when you need sometime the most, even a paper towel, be prepared for it to run out. \r\n- Overall, Good Luck."}, {"review_title": "Horrible culture in HR getting worse.

The turnover is crazy! I don't even know where to start on this review.  Hmm, let's start with the \"training\". You basically sit over someone's shoulder, and attempt to learn the complicated world of derivatives for 2 weeks, and then you are thrown on a client. Sink or swim. There is a class room downstairs, but it is never utilized for new employees except for orientation. So you can imagine the quality of work and customer service.  Your best bet is to try and ask the experienced workers, even ones not on your team, to try and help you  should they have time. \r\n\r\nRecently, SSB outsourced the derivatives processing to countries, having barley trained the people on how to do their jobs, and the company faced some serious issues in processing. It's suppose to be a deadline oriented environment, but I don't remember those countries  hitting a deadline for the last 2 months I worked there. So you are getting screamed at by client services, because the client wants to know why they can't get a single thing delivered to them on time. HERE'S THE CATCH! You can not mention the overseas group! You have to take the blame for the lack of processing done by the overseas group! That's right! Scapegoat has become your new Job description! Management never gives a direct answer or just plain OUT ignores the write up requests for the bad processing. \r\n\r\nThe hours are ridiculous. It was bad before the work shifted overseas but when you have to be the \"mouthpiece\" to the outsourced group because they are \"contractually unable\" to reach out for the pieces of information they need to process, somehow middle man became apart of your job description. They call it \"desk pairing\". After you spent 8-9 hours of your normal shift being the middle man, you have to spend another 8-9 hours doing the Job you are actually suppose to be doing! NO JOKE!  Staff is so low because EVERYONE is leaving. Why shouldn't they. The pay is a disgrace for everything being asked of you. Plus, this particular location is in a financial district, where there are like 5 other banks right next door that do the same/similar thing and pay a tad bit better. \r\n\r\nSo naturally that leads to high turnover. SO instead of hiring\"workers\" we are constantly getting management from different departments that know nothing of derivatives! When I left there was 1, only 1 officer, out VP, other officers, SA, assistant VP's that knew derivatives because he had been there so long.  So he had to support all OF MANAGEMENT AND ALL THE TEAMS with derivatives questions. Poor guy worked 14-15 hour days. Then, they started hiring people off the streets, aka no EXPERIENCE, bringing them in and starting them off as A2's, with A2 pay and not promoting A1's that had the knowledge and experience of an A2 or SA.  So, naturally all of those A1's with ALL OF THAT EXPERIENCE left. There were only 3 associates left with experience when I left.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's isn't even half of the issues, or work environment you can expect! Pretty much the KC  Deriv department is ate up!!"}, {"review_title": "Pass this opportunity if you can", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Nov 2015", "job_title": "AIS Tax Administrator II in Kansas City, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Please note, there is a Boston Tax Team in kansas city, and a new york tax team in kansas city.

This makes it difficult to learn the job if you are not an independent learner. \r\n\r\nManagement in New York loves having a hands-off approach and does not handle conflict or communication very well. They love to point fingers instead of working to resolve issues and put the client first. \r\n\r\nMost likely when you start this job, you will have to read from a textbook for the first 1-2 weeks of employment while they scramble around trying to get you access to login, and order you a phone. \r\n\r\nTax season is 50 - 60 hour work weeks and if you get assigned a difficult fund, it can be up to 70-80 weeks. Your manager is located in New York and usually will be too busy to speak with you except for about once or twice  a week. There is not a server for the New York files in kansas city, so be prepared to run into a bunch of IT problems that helpdesk in India is unable to solve (also management will usually not help you get your IT tickets resolved).

As a part-time intern and full-time undergraduate student pursuing a Management degree, I found the internship helpful in several ways. Over the summer, I applied for the State Street Scholars internship program at my school, and having been accepted into the program, I happily ended my three-year part-time career in retail sales to pursue work related to my field of study. The internship not only paid more than any salary I had made prior, but I was also able to get some real hands-on experience in the workforce, work among recent grads in the same age bracket, and gain some inside knowledge about how State Street runs its rather successful business. The eight-month internship will allow me to train alongside fund accountants, officers, and managers, and insofar, I have found much of the staff both friendly and helpful in guiding me through their workday. By May, I, along with a number of my fellow students, will be expected to receive job offers for entry-level positions in the company, giving me a subtle edge over many undergrads with little or no experience in the financial sector. The work is fairly straightforward, employees are typically laid-back and amicable, and the atmosphere remains fairly casual throughout the year.", "cons": "Obviously, and as many others have pointed out, the work at State Street can be described as anything but exhilarating. As a Management student, I find myself debating whether or not I would like to continue in an Accounting and Finance-related field, such as the one I am engaged with now. I find most of the fund accountants in my department, despite being friendly and easy-going outside of work, entangled in a monotonous web of cash projections, verifications, repetitive daily routines, and intense, 15-30-minute cycles of frantic work and boredom. The job, especially as an intern, can almost drive oneself to slumber, when there are few other tasks assigned except for observing the depressing work of a checklist-programmed employee. Throughout the day, one can witness employees and managers alike surfing the web between crucial moments of the day (pre-pricing, pricing, etc.). In fact, some employees even nod off during the extensive \"breaks,\" and to make matters worse, most of the employees in my group work several hours overtime almost every day of the week. For example, I have noticed some employees simply waiting around without work from 2:30PM until about 5:00PM, when they can actually start end-of-day work, which takes them an additional 2-3 hours to complete before they can go home. Perhaps this is commonplace in the realm of fund accounting, but as a part-timer about to graduate in the Spring, I want little part in such a job for very long."}, {"review_title": "A good stepping stone, but don't stay too long", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Mar 2009", "job_title": "Assistant Vice President in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "State Street has a laid back and easy going workplace environment.
