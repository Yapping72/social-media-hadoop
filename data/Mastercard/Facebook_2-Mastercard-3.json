APT started off in the retail and restaurant sectors, and given the acquisition by Mastercard, is now strong in the financial services vertical - so if you work in this verticals, there's a lot of internal expertise and credibility that will help you sell. If you're in one of the newer verticals, it's more challenging to bring in sales by nature of not having the existing clients to work off of - but this presents opportunity for you to stand out if you can close deals.\r\n- Fantastic office space. Newly renovated and fit to APT's culture. Four kitchens, plenty of free meals and snacks, and a lot of social activities as a company. You can certainly find you niche people if you know where to look.\r\n- Commission for CSP level and up\r\n- Awesome workplace for those young in their career and looking to learn some basics. Plenty of money allocated towards professional development and graduate studies (if interested). For the Sales team, significantly fewer training sessions for professional development, but you can reach out to HR about specific trainings and have them approve a budget for you to pursue them.\r\n*Not necessarily a Pro or Con, but a note: Promotions tend to happen every 2 years. If you perform well, you can maybe bump that to 1.5 years, but it's highly irregular for anyone to be promoted within that time frame - regardless of what they tell you during the recruitment process.", "cons": "- \"Bait and switch\" Sales job descriptions. Make sure you ask a lot of questions around the true day to day of your role. There has been a history of up-selling job descriptions on the Sales team (i.e. promising people they'll run full sales cycles on their own, manage their own relationships, potential for commission) but the day to day can be 95% cold outreach (cold emails, cold calls, etc.), especially if you are a BDA or early CSP. Spend time with those actually in the roles to get a feel for that rather than putting weight into what senior management says. Candidates should note that sales people are good at selling -- so they are the first ones who might mislead you about the role, particularly if they've been at the company for 5 or 10+ years and they lack a pulse on what has changed since the Mastercard acquisition (2015).\r\n- Empty office. If you're looking for a highly collaborative/social team, the sales team may not be a fit. The desks are frequently empty (a mix of travel schedules and people who choose to work from home), so it can be pretty quiet. For people who are here -- headphones in and silent for the most part. Fairly independent work.\r\n- Miscommunication across Sales senior management. There's a disconnect between the pulse of the office on the ground and those higher up. Leadership positions are held by those who haven't held traditional sales roles before so it can be challenging to be on the same page about realistic sales expectations and what it means to hit goals."}, {"review_title": "Modernization is  a Must", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "28 Dec 2019", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in O Fallon, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- There is plenty of potential to do more great things in the industry with great people\r\n- Excellent year end bonus\r\n- Clean campus\r\n- Depending on team/org, difficult and interesting problems to solve.

I 100% understand the need to protect IP but there must be balance.  Innovation is strangled by the \u201cculture of no\u201d mindset that corporate security has.  Getting new tech and tools approved requires their blessing and is often times an act of congress.\r\n- WFH is discouraged, depending on your manager/org.  The main office is pretty far from St. Louis and there is no satellite office.

Be prepared to work the job of two people. MasterCard calls this \"punching above your weight\" but it\u2019s really a bait and switch hiring practice.\r\n \r\nCareer advancement is extremely limited and based on managing up, nepotism and being a yes person at all costs. This makes the politics heavy and people are constantly back stabbing  each other. The VP title is equal to a manager at most large companies and holds no weight within the MasterCard. It's very hard if not impossible to advance beyond the VP position and many of them have been in the same position for 5 years or more. \r\n\r\nMasterCard doesn\u2019t do 360 performance reviews or assign you with real business goals, so there isn\u2019t any accountability. This has made it very easy for managers to coast for years. Most the middle management I worked with had outdated leadership skills and very limited technology experience. \r\n\r\nMasterCard is not a technology company. My Millennial peers in the tech community working at Google and Apple laugh at the notion that MasterCard is a tech company and would never consider working there. That's why you won't meet any Silicon Valley alums at MasterCard. This year MasterCard allowed employees to wear jeans every day and the Baby Boomer leaders acted like it was privilege. \r\n\r\nMasterCard loves to reorg every year and outsource and insource American jobs. The CEO and many of the executives are Indian nationals. They have no problem sending American jobs to India and bringing in lower paid H-1B Visa workers in from India to replace American workers."}, {"review_title": "Senior Consultant - Software Engineering", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great commitment to technology advances.

The health insurance policy used to be excellent and completely covered by APT.  Now, there are 3 poor high deductible plans to choose from.  Many people within APT are unsure of what their roles might look like in the future due to Mastercard\u2019s ability to do whatever it wants.  Many of APT\u2019s best employees have left for other opportunities in the last few years post-acquisition, and rightly so.\r\n\r\nWhile APT markets the role as strategy consulting, it is not.  While there are some elements of the job that involve strategic thinking, much of your time will be spent debugging things in the software.  Many things are driven by the software and what it\u2019s capable of, which stifles a lot of creative thinking and results in projects that follow a relatively cookie cutter approach.  You\u2019re also interacting with junior instead of senior clients.\r\n\r\nLong hours full of mundane work, such as password resets, client trainings, helping clients resolve trivial software issues, SQL work, editing decks, etc.  As other reviews have mentioned, you\u2019re \u201cglorified tech support.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe 360 review cycle pits employees against each other, making the process unnecessarily competitive and cutthroat.  An unlucky project or two with an unreasonable client or challenging internal team can drop your review and even lead to APT asking you to leave.\r\n\r\nAPT also claims to be mostly free of politics and hierarchy, which can be false.  Certain individuals have much more sway in the organization, and if they like or dislike you, this can have a major impact on your career.  The hierarchy is also present, where more senior team members pawn off mundane and time-consuming work to BCs and seem to have different, laxer standards imposed on them.\r\n\r\nWork / life balance is poor.  APT claims to have better work / life balance compared to management consulting firms, but this is frequently not the case.  Bad weeks can hit 80 hours when multiple clients are high burn, and the average is 55-60 hours per week.  Burnout and frustration are fairly common, and APT doesn\u2019t have a good approach for handling this.\r\n\r\nPoor exit opportunities.  Unlike management consulting, APT prefers that its employees stay for the long term.  The alumni network is basically nonexistent, and exit opportunities are never discussed during recruiting or at the company.  The skills you learn also aren\u2019t very transferable to other roles, with the primary non-school exit being into data science.  The brand equity is also extremely low compared to management consulting firms, and there\u2019s no graduate school sponsorship.\r\n\r\nCompensation starts off relatively high but drops off precipitously vs. management consulting as you move up the ladder."}, {"review_title": "Corporate", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Dec 2019", "job_title": "Analyst in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Mastercard offers great employee engagement events with its different internal employee interest groups.

Guests or interviewed people who come for the entire day often are unable to eat.\r\n5. Business attire policy. If you want to wear jeans on Fridays, than you have to pay $40 for a month ( 4 -5 Fridays).\r\n6. Company no more has any holiday\u2019s parties, including Christmas because it is expensive.\r\n7. All printers said on double side printing in b/w. Its very annoying to change setting each time toy need to have one side printing.\r\n8. Everybody needs to work in the office regardless of weather conditions. HR send out a letter saying that if you want to stay at work while bad snowfall that you have to take a day off.\r\n9.

There is a company gym facilities, you have to pay $25 a month.\r\n11. Lost badge- $25\r\n11. Everybody works on old heavy Dell computers.\r\n12.

Many folks they bring over on a work Visa that can't leave a company for 5 years.  Then they work them to death. If you are not on a product team you likely will be just managing propaganda and branding your team.  More work is spend on saying \"look what I did\" at MasterCard than actually doing work unless you are on a product team.\r\nOn a product team it is pretty much working 24x7 to get the product out the door on a shoe string budget.   Cowboy style of delivery where you throw something together and pull the trigger to get it into production and hope for the best.  Tehnical folks are required to be available ALL of the time.  Long hours in the middle of the night and all night on many occasions.  No overtime pay unless you are consulting but if you record what you work, they'll get rid of you and get someone you will work more but report less.  Leadership does not typically work more than 50 hours a week where technical resources can be working ALL of the time.  The greatest caution I can give you if you decide to work for MasterCard is be positive always and never make a negative comment or be too objective.  Roll with the flow and stay away from the front of the bus.  Extremely political climate with low technical aptitude individuals in the technical ranks.  The culture for technical folks is to get a bunch of people in a room and have them fight it out.  The best salesman wins vs. the most intelligent one or the one with the most experience.  If you have a sales background with just a generalist understanding of technology, you'll do great at MasterCard.  If you are a specialist with experience vs. just reading something and selling it, you'll go crazy.  Nothing worse than having more technical vs. sales skills in the MasterCard environment.  Other largest con I can think of is that you will receive no pay for performance at all.  It is entirely based on what project you are working on.  Little in the way of career growth at MasterCard.  This is a consulting environment and nothing more.  You will not grow.
