Why did they even hire me? As I waited i felt worthless, unwanted and regretted why I left my previous job to come to this unwelcoming place. Eventually i got up and told security of my situation and then they pinged my manager who was not in the office yet. It was the worst kind of handling and communication I experienced. I wondered how they handle big things when they cannot handle a simple task of welcoming / onboarding a new hire.\r\nWell, that was only the beginning of my misery.\r\n\r\nI have seen teams in India working at 2 am and 3 am.

Who would sign up for that?\r\n \r\nThis is one place I have heard the word decency or decency quotient at least once a day.

Some of them don't even have basic ethics, for example- they don't even know how to respond to a conflicting meeting invite.

It also shows a tremendous amount of ignorance as it's now shown that disrupting people's sleep is a health hazard (read the book \"Why we Sleep\" by a Harvard medical professor). I'm actually left angry when I receive these reckless meeting invites. An example - one of my colleagues from a different group got an invite to a 5am or 6am meeting from her manager on the day she returned from vacation.  She didn't even sleep that night because of the stress of having to get up so early. It turned out that the meeting was a completely routine, unimportant group meeting and her attendance was barely required, but the manager invited her because he was careless thoughtless and reckless - he even acknowledged that he knew it was 'early' but did so anyway. If you need to do some Global call, then schedule two meetings - making it convenient for everyone for at least one of those two meetings. Otherwise don't even invite people whose time zone is before 8am.\r\n\r\nThere's quite a bit of reverse discrimination at work, where I see female employees promoted disproportionately. People will argue with this but just providing my feedback. There are a lot of very effective and talented female senior managers at work, but there are a lot of clueless, inept ones too. On a related note, most promotions are in the headquarters of St. Louis and Purchase - orders of magnitude fewer are in other offices which is giving me pause on staying at MC.\r\n\r\nThe Voya retirement plan does not allow a proper self-directed option. I hate this - I can move to TD Ameritrade but only to buy additional set of mutual funds. This is not useful to me. This is actually causing me to look at other job opportunities, as if/when I leave I can then roll this account into a proper self-directed account. If this Voya restriction were lifted I would be much more likely to stay at MC and no longer look for another job.\r\n\r\nThere are no stock options really - equity component of compensation is crap or non-existent. Vesting schedule is 3 years? WTF - unheard of crap.\r\n\r\npayment to employees for patents is laughable. I used to get several thousand dollars for my patents in my last job. the MC payment is an insult. i won't even put my name on a patent at MC again - feels insulting to take such a low payment for the innovations.\r\n\r\nSenior Management makes very poor bets on opportunities - not enough investment, the PME process to overcome threshold to make investments is too high.- too much busy work.

This culture, combined with top-notch recruiting, makes the people at APT the best combination of intelligent, driven, and kind people. There is no \"partner\" or \"up or out\" culture that leads to backstabbing or hyper-competitiveness with peers. Your truly feel like a great team and family, even at such a large size.\r\n\r\nThe role itself, at its best, is an amazing opportunity to work on challenging analytics problems across several industries in a very short period of time. In a little over a year I worked in 6 different industries. Brainstorming the correct approach to answering a business question in a scientific manner is thrilling, and being such a data-driven company makes the work feel meaty, substantial, and valuable. The travel is also just the right amount: 1-2 days every month, enough to keep things fresh but not enough to become tiring.\r\n\r\nAPT also has a \"make it happen\" attitude that makes it easy for anyone to start ANYTHING that seems even somewhat relevant to the firm and that they are passionate about. This is in addition to the excellent volunteering policy. Prove value and these can develop into company efforts with allocation, hundreds of interested teammates, and possibly even a new department within the company. This type of freedom is rare if not completely non-existent at any other company.\r\n\r\nThe company invests a lot of in mentoring junior colleagues. You can grow very quickly as a new college grad, and within less than 2 years become a team manager and receive responsibilities that are unheard of at other firms.\r\n\r\nThe benefits and fun, youthful culture makes the firm almost magical. Free catered meals every day, working from home or remotely every few days a month, taking vacations whenever you want no-questions-asked, excellent social activities, game rooms, fun social groups, a lot of snacks, and lots of office perks makes it all seem like the perfect package.\r\n\r\nThe above those are rational reasons for why APT is an outstanding place to work, but it is a subjective evaluation that really brings it all together: there was not one day I spent at this company where I did not laugh, smile, feel good, and enjoy my time.", "cons": "While APT is a great place to work and has a lot of guidance and support for new hires, the \"guard rails\" on career development can be stifling for someone who comes in with experience or an advanced degree. Everyone starts at the same level, and the junior responsibilities are underwhelming for someone not immediately out of an undergrad degree. Because everyone starts at the same level, the pay - which is great for an undergrad - can be lower than other options (e.g. better than a McKinsey analyst, but worse than an associate). The big differentiator seems to be whether one gets promoted six months before the rest of one's class, which is not a great deal if one is bringing years of experience to the table at the start.\r\n\r\nRelated to above, the fast promotions also can make your managers be truly junior and - in spite of a lot of training - relatively bad at management.  As a more senior hire, I felt like I could do a better job at management than some of my managers, and after about a year I felt like I had surpassed my managers in competence in soft, technical, and managerial skills.\r\n\r\nWhile the BC role can be riveting in analytical thought partnership and problem-solving, it also can have some pretty mundane elements. Certain tasks can feel mundane either by their nature (e.g. password resets for a client user of the software) or due to poor execution (e.g. a client training can be a great opportunity for conceptual thinking, but sometimes it can devolve into a clicking tutorial). The company invested tremendously in tools like APT Academy to shave off these boring elements, but a part is still there.\r\n\r\nThe staffing model where you work on multiple clients at a time can make workload unpredictable. The average is likely 55 hours per week, but there is a 15 hour variance both above and below this point. At its worst, when all your teams are on fire the job can have a month or more of 70 hour weeks. Supposedly the staffing system is there to let your advisor respond to such situations, but I have never seen or heard of intervention here. Ultimately, success involves being defensive of one's time, \"under-promising and over-delivering\", and having a pessimistic outlook about your bandwidth in the future. This makes it difficult to be ambitious and shoot for doing your best work, because you are never sure when you will get blindsided. Sadly, \"going 80-20\" on things becomes a dominant culture, which usually means less investment up front that creates a maintenance mess down the line."}], [{"review_title": "Accounts Payable", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Accounts Payable in O'Fallon, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Flexible work style and benefits (can work from home if necessary, ample amount of time off)", "cons": "- Bureaucratic: \"overly concerned with procedure at the expense of efficiency or common sense\"\r\n- Hierarchy is obvious and very strongly tied to your significance\r\n- \"Open Door Policy\" is non-existent with upper management\r\n- Company acquisitions do not allow for enough time and resources to properly implement/transition \r\n- Minimal room for input and discussion"}, {"review_title": "HR Coordinator", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Oct 2016", "job_title": "Human Resources Coordinator in Arlington, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The greatest thing about working at APT is the culture here and how dedicated everyone is.

Pros:\r\n1. The company is growing quickly and has a very flat structure. These factors combined mean that you have a ton of opportunity to make an impact from very early on in your career.\r\n2. Career reviews are performed every 6 months and involve an in-depth process of capturing feedback from all peers that you've worked with. The cadence and depth of these reviews make it easy to progress in your career and feel like you have clear opportunities to work on.\r\n3. At its core, APT is a company that trusts its employees. For example, there's no time tracking to make sure that you've captured 40 hours, no one has to \"approve\" your vacations, etc. This could work pretty poorly at larger companies, but at APT there is an atmosphere where people are accountable and responsible even without \"management\" looking over their shoulders. \r\n4. There are plenty of perks (like snacks around the office, fun team events, and weekly catered lunches) - perks obviously aren't the most important part of working somewhere, but they do make it more fun.\r\n5. I work in the Arlington office and love the location - Arlington has a great \"city feel\" (there are tons of fun restaurants and shopping in the area, and you're also just miles away from DC and everything it has to offer). At the same time, because Arlington isn't as populated/popular as cities like DC, NYC, or SF, everything is more affordable and it's easier to find fun hiking trails and such.", "cons": "Some cons to note:\r\n1. Because APT has grown so quickly in the past couple of years, there are some \"growing pains\" (for example, some departments are pretty bottom-heavy).

Within my first 6 months, I was interacting with clients directly and given opportunities to present during meetings, and within my first 2 years, I was able to start managing and mentoring junior teammates and leading teams. There's definitely a steep learning curve within the first year at APT and it can be challenging at times, but once you have a better understanding of the software and how to juggle multiple projects at once, you start to enjoy the job a lot more and feel more confident.\r\nThe benefits and compensation are hard to beat as well. The kitchen is always stocked with snacks, and there's free food most days including catered lunch every Wednesday. There's a game room and ping pong room, as well as two massage chairs for use. In terms of work flexibility, I've never had any issues working remote or leaving early on a given day if I have another commitment. When you take vacation as well, people respect your time off and don't try and reach you while you're out.\r\nWorking with a large number of fortune 500 companies across every industry out there provides the opportunity to get exposure to project you're interested in and learn more about industries you're passionate about. It does seem however that newer projects have skewed towards the financial services industry, so that's something to keep in mind.\r\nFinally, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about what makes the culture great: the people. As a company that mostly hires out of undergrad, the majority of folks are young and eager to learn. There's definitely a collaborative culture here, and APT tends to attract motivated people who will do whatever it takes to get the job done.\r\nAll in all, APT has been a great first job with many things going right.", "cons": "Being staffed on multiple projects at once means there are some weeks that are spikier than others.

Hr will always follow the Manager provided  rating . \r\n3.  HR doesn't have any checks on managers like  if there was  6 monthly  rating discussion happened or not . \r\n4.  The rating you provided to manager should be neutral  in the manager survey else even though they are called confidential rating the manger can take a revenge on you in the next cycle and can make a case to get you out of the company. HR will be a mute spectator here . \r\n5.  you are suppose to own the rating provided to the your team even if you dont agree on it . So most of the manager will tell this rating was not in my control in the appraisal  cycle. \r\n6.  As per HR the skip level should happen once in 3 months .

MC can be good company based on which team you join. If you join O & T your doomed . \r\n8.

APT also invests in their engineers - lots of structured technical training when you join and throughout your first year, informal lunchtime 'brown bag' sessions where teams share knowledge, and the ability to start going to conferences after your first year.\r\n\r\nThe incredibly strong compensation never hurts either.\r\n\r\nThe people: Everyone here is young and incredibly smart, but down to earth. It's not a competitive environment - everyone wants to collaborate and will happily stop their work to help someone else. The entire engineering team sits on the same floor so it's easy to get to know everyone in the department. APT also encourages inter-department communication through paying for employees from different departments to go out to lunch together or competitions like trivia or kickball between interdepartmental 'houses'. \r\n\r\nIt's also a fairly social company - whether company-sponsored happy hours or picnics, team events for bonding or celebrating milestones, or the variety of internal social listservs. Interested APT employees use the listservs to coordinate sports teams, attending concerts, skiing trips, board game nights, and much much more. Coming straight out of college, it was easy to make new friends through these groups and then working with your friends makes time at the office that much better.\r\n\r\nDC: As someone from the east coast, I wanted a great tech career without having to move out west and DC is a great city. Many know it for politics, monuments, and museums, but it has so much more. There is a strong theater and comedy scene, lots of trails for biking and running, easy access to professional sports games, and access to athletic facilities like trapeze, parkour, and curling. Despite its many hiccups the subway system is one of the better ones in the US and makes it easy to get around DC and nearby suburbs in MD and VA. If you need to get out of DC, there are lots of Zipcars and it's easy to metro/Uber to Amtrak, Megabus/Boltbus/Greyhound, and 3 airports.\r\n\r\nAll in all, APT is a great technology company in a fantastic city.", "cons": "As the engineering team and product suite has grown, engineers no longer have a hand in all the features and don't always know the interesting problems other teams are tackling.

For example, a lot of folks on the consulting side are also involved in other areas of the firm such as product development, marketing, sales and recruiting. If you're interested in something that is not part of your traditional role, you can easily find opportunities to do so and also get official allocation for it.\r\n- Great respect for analytical rigor. The questions we tackle are some of the most important and challenging questions that businesses face these days and we ensure that our answers are robust and backed by data.

Opportunities for advancement as a people manager are plentiful for those with a keen acumen of IT-to-business value and good management skills.  For those on a purely technical career path, opportunities for advancement *can* be plentiful.  However you'll need to be very adaptable and not tied to just one technology or job function.  Otherwise, it's possible to reach a block point where further advancement within a given discipline isn't possible.\r\n\r\nThe workforce at MasterCard have a great community spirit.  Whether it's through the business resource groups (Women's Leadership Network, Young Professionals, PRIDE, Technology Leadership Network, etc.) or through involvement with the United Way and Junior Achievement the people of MasterCard do a lot of fantastic things together.  \r\n\r\nThe campus is nice, including a cafeteria, gym, and a few gaming areas.  Internal programs for computer based training on programs like PCI, ITIL, and Six-Sigma as well as opportunities to participate on tiger-team type functions are easily available should you have the time or inclination to want them.\r\n\r\nCommercially, the company is doing fantastic.  Internally the operations world is in a state of transition.  As MasterCard continues to push for deeper connections direct to the consumer that will call for an adaptation of their IT Operations and Technology staffing and mindset.", "cons": "Work load can be INTENSE for those wanting to advance their career.  You will not find much opportunity here if you're only interested in coming in and doing an 8 hour day with an hour lunch in the middle.\r\n\r\nDue to a focus on the consumer, MasterCard has several initiatives rushing to market in parallel and as such require delivery of IT Service and Operational support at a rapid pace.  Though the company is operating that way at the top, IT staffing and funding decisions aren't based around that same mantra.  For people managers who identify a staffing gap, it's often only after a process *breaks* that the business case is given merit.\r\n\r\nThe campus is nice, however it's going through some changes.  Due to space constraints a \"cube restack\" is changing the cubicle configuration to a smaller, less private cube.  There are collaborative \"pod\" configurations as well. BUT ultimately if you're a people manager requiring privacy or a technical person who requires distraction-free working conditions you'll find them in short supply.  However, they do offer an alternative workplace program for tele-working.   \r\n\r\nIt's disappointing that the gym and cafeteria aren't subsidized.  Though convenient, the cafeteria food becomes pretty repetitive and the pricing doesn't provide a satisfaction that you've gotten what you paid for.  The gym again is incredibly convenient, but can be very crowded during peak usage, especially if you have a short window to get your workout in.  For the monthly price paid (with no discount options for full year or contract based pricing) the gym waters down the value of having it on site.\r\n\r\nBecause the company is doing so well and driving so hard with card-holder focused initiatives there is a distinct lack of resources.  Both from a staffing perspective, as well as training and tool funding.  The intense pressure to outsource operational level tasks all while maintaining the same ops tempo has lead to challenges internally in quality requiring more time and pressure on deliverable schedules.\r\n\r\nThe big question is would I recommend this company to others?  That answer for me is still a **yes**.  Of course there are challenges, but in today's IT world I don't really know of any opportunities in the local area that don't have those in some form or another.  If MasterCard is still in exactly the same place it is now five years in the future, maybe that answer changes.

Starting very early on, you are given a lot of responsibility on your client teams, including leading the analytical work, presenting to C-suite executives at the client, and beginning to manage interns and new hires starting at the end of your first year.  This responsibility and the ability to take ownership of work is incredibly valuable - it has provided me with very applicable business skills for my career.  APT places a lot of emphasis on formal professional development as well, with detailed reviews every 6 months in which you can gain a better understanding of what things your teammates appreciate and what you can work on.  Coupled with informal feedback throughout the year, I believe that these reviews have helped me grow more quickly than I could have otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe work at APT is also very diverse, which keeps every day interesting - I am never bored.  As a Business Consultant, you have a variety of different tasks related to data work, analytical work, and client interactions.  As soon as you start mastering those tasks, you begin to take on more managerial and project management tasks, which teaches you new skills that you never really have a chance to learn in college.  In addition, because of our software-based business model, you are working for many clients at once (and the number just keeps growing!) so you see many different industries and types of business problems very quickly.  One year in, I have worked on 6 client teams in 5 different industries and have participated in other internal teams as well.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of working at APT is the culture.  The atmosphere is incredibly collegial (which helps ease the transition into the real world post-college!) and the company really does want us to be happy.  This translates into fully stocked kitchens and free food almost every day, a game room, Harry Potter-like houses with competitions, and a lot of really smart and motivated teammates and colleagues.  The executives take pride in this collegial environment as well, as they know everyone's name, work to get to know you, and participate in culture-building events (e.g. the president is a regular at Wednesday morning basketball).
