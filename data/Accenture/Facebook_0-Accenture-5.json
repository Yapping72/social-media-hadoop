My first role was horrendous leaving myself and others on the team incredibly stressed daily which impacted both mental and physical health. Anxiety attacks happening regularly by a team is a serious red flag that should be raised and addressed by leadership. It was explained to me that lack of budget meant lack of leadership, aid, resources, and assistance. Additionally, there is a tier system in the company, one of which you are either a full time employee at Accenture or a contractor provided with less benefits and hourly wages which I would make a case of being extremely under market value (how does the largest consulting company in the world justify paying full time staff based in the US less than $50K a year to provide support to a globally-known and profiting client?) If you decide to leave your role for another within Accenture, your notice and last day on current role is dependent on what your manager and future manager decides, meaning the traditional two weeks notice and you defining your start and end dates is out of your hands and decided by others. It can be two weeks or it can be extended for weeks on end without knowing a finalized end date...management makes that decision. This is not always the case, but a deep concern anyone should have when applying and wanting to leave their current role for another within Accenture. Cost of inflation has dramatically increased both in the US and globally in the past six months. Review process takes a year and decisions of pay increase, promotion, or bonuses are made by likely someone from leadership whom you don't interact with. You are pitched to leadership by a sponsor on if you should be promoted, they have 3 minutes to make your case. My understanding is that most employees within the Marketing Operations umbrella did not receive pay increases or promotions and focus was made on providing bonuses instead. As stated, the cost of living has increased significantly, November is when employees find out if they get promotions or increases in pay, and this week I have discovered that the company does not provide increases to accommodate COLA."}, {"review_title": "Good work experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Remote work, Great team, Experienced working in latest modules", "cons": "Extra working hours, lot of company trainings"}, {"review_title": "Great company to learn & grow", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Associate Manager in Paris", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management Career path Challenges Impact on companies", "cons": "Should not count the working hours"}, {"review_title": "N/A", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Associate Software Engineer in Mandaluyong City", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Career changing, not bad for those who loves to explore life challenges and work", "cons": "Putting to an unfit work"}, {"review_title": "Incredible talent", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "13 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Senior Manager in Lisbon, Lisbon District", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Talent; Work ethics; world leader; global; inclusive", "cons": "Slow careers; bad leadership; work/life balance"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Consultant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing supportive people!
