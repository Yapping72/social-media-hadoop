Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Coming from the perspective of a junior in the firm (working in Accenture as a first job after graduation):\r\n- Decent benefits\r\n- People at the working level are generally friendly and cooperative\r\n- Great brand name\r\n- Stakeholder management is something you get to develop early on in your career (dealing with difficult clients, demanding superiors)", "cons": "Not mincing my words, here are my general observations:\r\n\r\n- It is easy to feel lost in the firm as a junior without support/ mentors. You have to build your own network and pick up things on your own\r\n- The outright focus on billing and chargeability for analysts means that more often than so you do not have a say/ flexibility over what you want to work on and end up getting stuck in certain roles/projects (defeating the purpose of joining consulting for a variety of experiences)\r\n- The hype of recruitment on-campus is slightly overrated. If you're in Consulting, most of work you will be doing is less related to \"VR experiences\" or \"Design Thinking\" and more towards producing documentations (slides, word docs, excel sheets) and for the client More often than so you will be placed on projects with little to no context and be expected to deliver without much guidance i.e. \"the relevant materials are in our SharePoint, go read them and talk to the client\"; also in many cases there is less room for innovation as the clients already know what they want and expect us to execute their demands (generally the top-down nature of clients in Singapore)\r\n- Partners/ Managing Directors as rainmakers are often silo-ed from the realities of struggles faced at the working level. Be it long working hours or demands from difficult clients taking a toll on your mental/physical health, lack of growth in current role, transparency on remuneration and promotion, everything ultimately boils down to sales - exaggerating the good side of things and overlooking the not-so-good. This is what results in many promising individuals leaving the firm for better opportunities\r\n- Due to the gap between Leadership and the working level, mid-management (Senior Managers) can sometimes assume the mantle and belittle the working level on the basis of their somewhat unreasonable demands. This creates a culture of fear that is unnecessary and unproductive\r\n- As with most MNCs, favoritism exists and promotion is not always made on the basis of capability, but visibility"}, {"review_title": "What is it like to work here", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Consultant in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Project based\r\nhigh paying job\r\nForces you to learn new things", "cons": "Lacks structure, competitive, less bonus"}, {"review_title": "ok", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "29 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Consultant in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good to work at accenture", "cons": "micromanagement, over work and no compensation for overtime"}, {"review_title": "Insufficient growth", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work Culture as no tracking system involved", "cons": "Lack of latest technologies used in projects"}, {"review_title": "Hit or miss", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Analyst in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Big brand name, smart colleagues", "cons": "Life is gonna suck if you\u2019re put in a lousy project"}, {"review_title": "Career", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Loads of exposure to new technology", "cons": "Nothing much, its not applicable"}, {"review_title": "Great firm", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Consultant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People and culture.
