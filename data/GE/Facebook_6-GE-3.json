About 10+, 20+ hours a week. In the end, you spend every waking hour, breathing and living GE. Essentially the courses you study for as free training. \r\n\r\nYour managers also vary every 6 months, and I will have to say that most I've found were mediocre at best. In my four rotations at GE, I have had one manager I truly thought was exceptional.
