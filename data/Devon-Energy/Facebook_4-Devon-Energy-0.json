It was not related to the business- more management and scheduling than anything.\r\n\r\nManagement was horribly disorganized at times. It depends on your manager. My biggest beef is that we were re-organized 4 times in late 2013 to mid-2014, and for a while I really had no idea who my manager was - I had to keep looking at Strata to find out. That's on management and communication skills.\r\n\r\nOffice politics can be out of control, but I am not sure if it is the individuals involved, or a by-product of the cross-border management (people trying harder to get noticed due to distant managers).
