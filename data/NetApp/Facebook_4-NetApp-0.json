I did my research based on the Americas, and then when I started the role I spoke to EMEA people and the feedback is completely different. Work-life balance is completely nonexistent - on top of your work, you have to do multiple pieces of training, projects, presentations, etc. this is not used for customers. It's an addition to your work so you can add badges on LinkedIn or share posts. Which in a way is good but when you work from 8 am to 5 pm and then you have to do these add-ons you have no time for yourself. Management can't delegate and doesn't assign tasks - it's all on you. When you are new you are just thrown into a deep end and your manager will only contact you to be negative towards you. Throughout my 8 months at the company, my manager did not contact me to say anything positive once. You can reach 100% of your target and your manager will contact you asking why you didn't hit 175% and what are you doing wrong. They don't give you any coaching or offer to help with skills. It's best you don't have any struggles outside of work because, on the EMEA contract, they won't be happy with that. Management sends out emails over the weekend, with work tasks or work updates.. again as mentioned previously there is no work-life balance even outside of working hours. The progression is extremely poor on the EMEA side, people leave their roles after 2/3 years as there is no chance they will be moved up the ladder. The only way you can get to another role is by leaving and coming back to a different role. Managers are like gatekeepers for those who want to progress unless you are part of the 'click'.

I will try my best to cover most of them.\n1) There is no Work-Life balance, and the pay doesn't even weigh against the demands that are asked of you. You get squeezed for 10x the pay that you get. \nI would say Amazon is way better than NetApp - actually, this statement alone should summarize the working experience at NetApp.\n2) Many old employees are still in the company, working for over a decade. This is not good in many ways - you won't have an opportunity to get ahead and experience growth in the company because of that. The Company won't promote them easily; they aren't talented enough and can't promote you as you are relatively new.\n3) These Old blood employees are used to archaic ways of working, they expect newbies to be submissive and take orders regardless of their intellectual prowess.\n4) Many of these old employees are from EMC or HP or some other legacy companies - they feed on toxic work culture - i.e. try and expose other team members' weaknesses in team meetings, group chats and etc. so that they can make a statement that they are way ahead of them. They backstab, they suck up to their bosses, and so on. Every crappy thing you can imagine at a workplace can be found here.\n5) Freshers and newbies who are motivated and raring to go, rarely stay here for more than 6 months - that's telling of so many things.\n6) Tech Stack is absolutely archaic, not many teams work on cutting-edge technologies. Even if they do, the scope and scale at which you can solve problems are significantly less.\n7) Tools and processes surrounding Engineering productivity are very old and bad - they actually hamper your productivity. If for some reason, you cant use these tools or find them counterintuitive, you cant make progress in your work.\n8) Approvals from managers take forever - for some reason, they don't quite like to make things easy for their reports.\n9) This is one of the BIGGEST cons - they lay off, so much so that you feel the heat every day coming into the work - this heat can come in the form of coworkers who are constantly looking to throw you under the bus for whatever reason they can find as they know If they can't find a reason, they know others will throw them under the bus. The company knows well about this situation and uses it to squeeze the last drop out of you.\n\n10) Layoffs are a constant threat - they can happen every month, every quarter, and so on. \n\n11) You will NEVER get a feeling that you are part of the company, the managers make sure of that - for eg. if you are not part of the \"circle\", you will never get the same treatment as others in the circle would get. You can't joke, you cant ask good questions, if you still went ahead and did it, responses from the other side would be very discouraging. \n\n12) A lot of useless acquisitions were made in the past and are continuously being made currently as well - most of these products dont gel well with the core product or contribute to the company's future goals."}, {"review_title": "Great Place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Aug 2022", "job_title": "GRC Analyst in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work culture is awesome\r\nFlexibility in work\r\nCompensation", "cons": "Nothing worth mentioning.

I liked him, and think he was a good, honest person fighting an uphill battle to do a good job, just like the rest of the support organization.", "cons": "Foremost is the politics. You had better be good at politics if you want to succeed as a TSE at NetApp, otherwise you'll wind up with every case in the support center assigned to your name. I've experienced nothing like it anywhere else. Bad relationships between teams, poorly defined roles, cliques, every negative thing about corporate culture you can think of exists in abundance here. The work environment presents itself as friendly initially, but the facade doesn't last long. Once you get pulled into the political landscape, and this is unavoidable, it quickly becomes hostile. The primary pastime in the NetApp TSE area was badmouthing co-workers. If you were not in the in-crowd, people talked about you like a dog. The support area is open with low cubicle walls, and you'd hear people loudly saying the most horrible things about their co-workers just a few seats over. I'm not talking about constructive criticism or fun banter, either. I'm talking about vicious, mean spirited, behind-the-back (and sometimes to the face) berating, intended to get people fired.\r\n\r\nSecond is the complete lack of useful training. NetApp talks a lot about lateral skills during the interview process, but what they REALLY mean is \"lateral concepts.\" You might be a 20 year Active Directory veteran, but your cases will deal with the NetApp implementation of AD, and how your customers have integrated it. Your AD knowledge will help you figure some things out, but mostly you'll be reverse engineering NetAp software, and troubleshooting bad customer implementations. What I received in the way of training was the following advice. \"Get on the intranet and find some training you think looks useful.\" I had no idea what type of calls I'd be taking, so how could I possibly know which training courses to take? Even if I knew what type of calls I'd be taking, there was no (zero) useful training available to me initially in those areas. I didn't receive any training specific to my vertical until I'd been with the company for 9 months. So I took a few of the CBT's that looked related to my role, then was unceremoniously thrown into the call queue a week later. My phone just started ringing one day, and I was totally unprepared. Asking questions was highly resented, and doing so usually resulted in getting attitude from the person you asked, or as was common, they can't help because they're too busy.\r\n\r\nLearning and documentation were the second major failing. Knowledge is scattered throughout various systems, some of which I didn't have access to. Resources were not clearly labeled for which version of NetApp software they apply to. You might run across an existing bug, but there's no way to know most times, because there is an arcane and user unfriendly way of documenting things at NetApp that new people cannot possibly comprehend. In short, you are thrown to the wolves with no way to defend yourself. I requested books, or offline training specific to my role that I could do at home multiple times, but there were none. Being a new TSE was one of the most uncomfortable and unpleasant experiences of my entire life. I was frequently assigned cases from other verticals that I had no training, or experience with, and other teams refused to help or take ownership. I was assigned \"secure\" cases, since I had clearance, in which I had to troubleshoot with no logs, remote access, nothing but verbal communication. I was assigned cases where I did not speak the same language as the customer, and sometimes it would take more than an hour to get an interpreter on the phone. To sum it up, every case was a learning opportunity with no learning resources available.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, there was a very high turnover rate. Just going by memory, during my two-year employment, I can recall 10 people either resigning or leaving a 15-person team. I was hired on to cover a recent wave of turnover, as a matter of fact. Needless to say, we were constantly short-handed, and it takes a year or more for most TSE's to become useful due to the complete lack of useful training when you are hired.\r\n\r\nTSE jobs at NetApp were shift work when I was there, but it quickly became apparent I had to research my cases at home. When you are in the call queue, you constantly receive new cases. They assigned me a mentor who confided in me he quit for this very reason. You are expected to update ALL cases daily, and this includes customer communication. So once you get a certain number of cases, you can spend entire days just doing non-productive case updates. Some of your cases will stay open for weeks or months, even when it's apparent there is no problem with a NetApp product, because the account teams refuse to let you close them. Even when you're not working at home, it's impossible to relax or sleep because of the unmanageable stress levels during the workday.\r\n\r\nTo put the icing on the cake, NetApp devices were (at the time) EXTREMELY opaque, and difficult to support. There were few built-in troubleshooting tools for my vertical, and no established troubleshooting protocols. It was the wild west, anything goes. The devices had GUI management that was notoriously unreliable and buggy in the support center, so you relied exclusively on CLI commands for NetApp's CDOT operating system, which is not similar to any other operating system you might be familiar with. The process for filing bugs was beyond any convoluted, almost intentionally quirky process I've ever experienced. Even if you manage to get your bug accepted, which sometimes seemed like a literal miracle, the engineering team was notoriously difficult to work with, and deeply resented any collaboration with TSE's. A co-worker had a case once that ran for an entire year before engineering accepted it. That's 12 months where this guy was on regular calls, sending case updates, collecting additional data, etc. So you wind up with a lot of cases where the account team and customers are pushing you for resolution, but engineering won't accept your bug, so the case stays in your ownership and you get to deal with an increasingly angry customer every day. The bug tracking software itself appeared to have been coded in the 1960s. It really seemed like NetApp went out of their way to make their devices as difficult as possible to support on the back end, and this just added to the stress.\r\n\r\nThere was no incentive for me to advance in the support organization, because all the negative things about being a TSE were only amplified at the EE level. The only stated advancement goal I ever heard in support was to get out of support.\r\n\r\nSome people love working there, and more power to them. It's an environment that certain personality types can thrive in, but not mine. If you don't thrive in a highly political environment that is superficially friendly, but hostile underneath, avoid being a TSE at NetApp."}, {"review_title": "Great experience but nothing too special", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 May 2022", "job_title": "Program Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Big enough to have resources but small enough to be efficient in getting things done.\r\nFelt like leadership cared about employees.\r\nPay is on par with the industry.\r\nSupportive of personal development.", "cons": "Still a tech company like many others - stockholder satisfaction is highest priority. \r\n\r\nStrange marketing decisions."}, {"review_title": "NetApp talks the talk, but they don't walk the walk.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Test Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "NetApp pays well, they offer good benefits.", "cons": "Lots of silos, lots of politics, lots of either layoffs, or reduction in staff one way or the other.

Innovation has been stifled to say the least - this company seems to be filled with old timers in senior leadership roles that are stuck in the glory days of on-premise data centers. Despite the recent marketing push for becoming \"a cloud/multi-cloud specialist\" and the new cloud focus of the company, I can assure you that ONTAP and on-premise data centers are still king. Compensation is relatively low by industry standards and equity grants are kind of a joke. Even though NetApp likes to flaunt that they're a \"pay for performance\" company the yearly bonus' are strongly tied to company performance which has been pretty awful for the last several years so even as a high performing employee I received ~56% of my target bonus for the last year. Considering that is a major lever in the realm of total compensation - it's important that people know that your NetApp salary is the only reliable piece of your TC (especially since stock has been plummeting over the last 5 quarters and thus equity grants are meh)."}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Mar 2021", "job_title": "QA Engineer in Reykjav\u00edk", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Greate company, plenty of opportunities to grow.", "cons": "They sometimes do not walk the talk."}, {"review_title": "Fast paced and plenty of rabbit holes to get lost in", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "18 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Support Engineer in Raleigh, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of smart people to work with.", "cons": "Some people are just too smart to work with."}], [{"review_title": "Netapp review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Fremont, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- good working environment\r\n- good benefits", "cons": "- work assignments not flexible"}, {"review_title": "N/A", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Support Account Manager in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are too many features provided", "cons": "Can't Really think of anything"}, {"review_title": "Enjoyable company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "10 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Account Manager in Amsterdam", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good culture, people and management", "cons": "Targets are not always realistic"}, {"review_title": "Great culture and company !", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Commercial Territory Representative in Saint Petersburg, Sankt-Peterburg", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good management, no micro management, team spirit and strong team vibes.", "cons": "I wouldn't name any cons for now.
