Stating Razer has a 'poor work/life balance' does not accurately describe the perpetual crunch working on the USA CA Team. It got increasingly worse over the 3 years I worked there. Individual work capacity and/or bandwidth were not considered for me and there was a constant stream of new initiatives, products and fires to put out in addition to current workload/projects. Chaotic shuffling of priorities (often times driven by other BU's with no air support from CA Leadership) prevented a lot of proactive work and resulted in lots of waste for the Team/Company.\n\nOver my 20 years experience in tech/management I've learned to say 'no' when it makes sense but at Razer there was a firehouse of directives/projects/additional responsibilities where you simply didn't have a choice, it had to get done and you best believe the timeline was tight/budget was light. I felt like an outsourced and overworked employee. It didn't help I was promised promotions throughout my time there but through attrition and changes in management it never happened. All the Sr. Managers of CA had or left soon after and the majority of the directors left or were fired by the time I put in my resignation. \n\nThe high level of quality expected by Senior Leadership/execs in all aspects of the business are misaligned with allocated resources/capacity resulting in subpar delivery which was a real moral buster for me considering I take pride in my work. Really felt my strengths where wasted and I was utterly burnt out.\n\nCA's reliance on an external PMO/BPO Model lead to big challenges in hiring, quality of service and budget allocation. \n\nCulture was okay prior to the pandemic but was completely devoid 6 months into it. Culture retreated into functional groups and I did my best to maintain some resemblance of it. Perks like the catered lunches, which where great when in office, evaporated and there was no stipend to replace this perk for forced stay-at-home workers.
