It was frustrating to go home and tell my wife instances at Facebook and then get her opinion saying I said or did nothing wrong. Over and over again I was looked at as the enemy when I had no intention of hurting anyone. \n\nBeing a white male at Facebook you are looked at as the problem and reason that is bringing a certain race or ethnicity down. During my bi annual review I was told by my Asian manager to work on toning down \"Your White privilege\" during meetings. Excuse me? If my wife had a manager that asked or accused her of taking advantage of the fact she's black there would be lawsuit. \n\nI am not a racist, I or my parents, grandparents or great grandparents have never enslaved anyone. In my eyes everyone is the same and deserves a fair shot, but at the end of the day all white people are not bad and allowing people to blatantly accuse you of being racist without repercussion is what Facebook 100% supports and at times promotes though the classes you have to take as a employee.\n\nFacebook has a policy that someone of color should be interviewed for every position, which is fine but I witnessed several times Asian and African American managers completely ignore someone who was white and more qualified and gave the job to someone of their own ethnicity. Out of the 10 times I saw that happen, 7 of those people were eventually fired cause they just couldn't do the job.\n\nIn summary, this attitude that white people are the root reason why every other ethnicity experiences problems is just flat out sad. Then it is taught and supported by companies like Facebook, which only separates us further. Out of any group there are bad apples, but that is no reason to come up with a blanket opinion and then teach that from generation to generation, that is the exact opposite of progression and being united.\n\nA direct quote from my father in law (Who is black) \"Above being just black, more importantly I am an American, where you can make anything of yourself if you stop coming up with excuses and just get to work, white people are not the problem and we need to stop teaching our kids that they are\"."}, {"review_title": "Operations manager", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people to work with and netwy", "cons": "Work life balance can be challenging"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good WLB, Supportive Managers, Good pay", "cons": "High expectations for succeeding in your role"}, {"review_title": "Ok company", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Product Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good growth for a big company", "cons": "No future direction given meta"}, {"review_title": "To new to review", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Project Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Looks like good benefits, but have not been in an office yet", "cons": "A lot of organizational changes"}, {"review_title": "Hard core place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Product Manager in Z\u00fcrich", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Super interesting problems to work on\r\n- Cool folks to learn from\r\n- Amazing benefits", "cons": "-get a grip on privacy -

If you have a bad manager, you're SOL and your only options are switching teams or dealing with it. It's also common to have many manager changes and it's not that unusual if they only stick around for a half, leave, and then you're \"managed\" by an overwhelmed skip who probably won't be able to represent you accurately at performance reviews or make much time for you.\n- So many damn re-orgs and it scrambles everyone except directors so much but they don't care because that's their impact for the half"}, {"review_title": "Thoughtful, positive environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "30 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone I've worked with at Facebook over the last five years is really empathetic and caring about their coworkers.
