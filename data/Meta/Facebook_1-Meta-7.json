Gaslighting is exactly what is the culture that is imposed top-down by management. It starts at the bootcamp. There, you'll be properly brainwashed how cute and cuddly Facebook is, how unfairly it is being treated by everybody, how great and kind the Czar and his ruling gang is, and how grateful and privileged you (a despicable useless worm) should feel to be here! Right there, in the bootcamp, they will start the abusive treatment by telling you \"why on Earth did we hire you? You do not submit any code during last 24 hours!\" This abuse and fostering of your impostor syndrome will keep going on.

This is part of this culture! \r\nThere is a STACK RANKING! It's in tooling, in manager training materials! The fact that Facebook officially denies doing it is a yet-another confirmation that this company doesn't shy away from crime. Stack ranking means that all colleagues see each other as a competition. When I started my job at Facebook, my closest colleague didn't want to talk to me, because he knew that the better I succeed, the worse is for him. This is very profound and affects everybody: it's a hostile work environment. \r\nPerformance reviews is a complete sham. There is one \"axis\" which is related to your actual performance. The other 3 (three!) axes (direction, etc.) is a complete baloney, and can be used to justify ANY rating for anyone. All managers are deeply ignorant schmoozers. \r\n\r\nCult means there are plenty of taboo topics for which you'll be fired. There are, for example, internal \"non-managers\" groups, which are patrolled for any signs of dissent. If a person posts anything out of line there, this gets straight to his manager and HR. \r\nHR is the worst people I've met. They enforce the authoritarian rule ruthlessly and with cynicism. \r\n\r\nWorking at Facebook has permanently damaged my faith in humanity.

That level of access is phenomenal. \n\nIf you have an idea you can do it. You have the support and finances to achieve whatever you can think of.

It\u2019s valuable to reflect on all that happens in a year at work, considering how much energy, time, and effort we put into it. \n\nWhen you make it to your 10-year milestone (my count down starts now), you get the opportunity to join Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and others on the management team to tell a 10-year Faceversary story to the entire company.

Drinking from the firehose and learning a ton. Autonomy, authority and support. World-class benefits. Open culture to the bones. An inside look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good. Five core values in action. Pretty darn happy. \n \nI get the pleasure to work with incredible, impressive, and talented people daily. Both within the walls of Facebook, but also with clients and partners who are working on some unbelievable things. My pod and my core team are just legendary. This isn\u2019t lip service. I really get to work with and learn from the very best. \n \nI\u2019ve learnt SO MUCH. About digital advertising and marketing. About financial services. About media. About other industry verticals I previously knew nothing about. About navigating complex circumstances. About working for a company that\u2019s constantly in the spotlight. About digging deeper to really understand. About cross-functional collaboration. About partnerships. About technology. And much more.

Further, I get to shape and influence how businesses engage, nurture, and build new relationships with people.\n\nI have access to incredible benefits that I\u2019m astonished by daily and so grateful for. In fact, I\u2019m writing this post while on paid paternity leave to spend time with my family and our new addition, Logan. \n \nFacebook fosters an open culture that is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. Mark hosts a weekly company-wide Q&A where he addresses thoughtful and difficult questions about a wide-range of issues and opportunities. Everyone, from Interns to tenured employees, are welcome to ask anything and they don\u2019t face judgement or criticism for raising difficult topics. On our internal Workplace (Facebook for Work), I can join and learn about a whole host of interesting projects, regardless of whether I\u2019m involved in them. \n \nI\u2019ve learnt a lot about both the harmful ways and the incredibly positive ways Facebook can be used. I get a firsthand look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good.\n\nThere are 5 core values that guide how we work at Facebook. And I see them in practice regularly. Build social value. Move fast. Be bold. Be open. Focus on impact. \n \nI\u2019ve always been fortunate in my career. I\u2019ve worked on amazing teams, on fascinating projects, with inspiring mentors and leaders. Facebook has been a continuation of that for me.

Many managers at Facebook were thrust into a management role because they were of an appropriate level - not because they are good managers. There is very little accountability for bad managers, and good management skills are rarely counted as notable.

Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering.  You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does.  Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute.\r\n\r\n2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles.  Also, be prepared for mansplaining.\r\n\r\n3) more money than sense:  gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around.  there's basically an offsite every other week.  Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing.  The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place.\r\n\r\n4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers.  no, seriously.  say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away.  you are kicked off the team and put on another team.  what sense does that make?  new mom wants to wfh?  not allowed. \r\n Seriously, it's called skype, people.  \r\n\r\n5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack.  instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project.  a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project.  This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship.\r\n\r\n6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken.  I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly.  bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix.  seriously?  why not just admit all your metrics are wrong?\r\n\r\n7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance.  no really, if I hear the phrase make \"an impact\" I will vom.  What this really means is not \"do good and useful work\" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE.  Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why.

He surrounds himself with fantastic people, listens carefully, cares about the people who work for him, and makes long view decisions for the health of the company. \r\n\r\nManagement and the people who work at Facebook follow leadership's example, everyone rolls up their sleeves to get the work done, and is incredibly grateful to be here. \r\n\r\nAs a woman it's also inspiring and impactful to have female leadership at all levels, and colleagues who are incredibly encouraging. I personally experienced this when a male peer encouraged me to apply for a management position on our team. He referenced the known bias that women are less likely to apply if they don't have 100% of qualifications vs. men who take it as a suggestion. Beyond gender, the entire company strives for diversity and acceptance.", "cons": "You have to be very self driven to succeed. Seeking out and maintaining internal relationships is critical for success. If you enjoy titles, offices and structure, this is not the place for you! \r\n\r\nWe have a saying at Facebook, \"nothing is someone else's problem\".

They let you pick a team, which essentially means you get to pick your tech stack (Backend; Front-end; Mobile; Infrastructure), the org you work for (Messenger, Facebook, Oculus, Instagram, etc.). More importantly, you get to pick your manager + team mates, where as in other large companies, it's the other way around; you are assigned to a product & org  & manager whether you like it or not. This is way different compared to Google's opaque 'host matching' process and Microsoft where they just randomly place you in a division like Azure or Office.\r\n\r\nThe company values really shine through every day. Before Facebook I thought the concept of company values was kind of corny and B.S. Now that I'm at FB I can at least say that here the company values are actually values held by top management + majority of the workforce and not just marketing / HR speak.\r\n\r\nEveryday I really feel like we are moving fast and shipping a lot of product very quickly. We A/B test lots of features, analyze the data, and swiftly decide what to ship to the public. I never feel stuck; I always feel like I'm either implementing an A/B test or analyzing data so we can ship more features. There are not long product cycles with lots of prognostication from product leadership; we build, measure, then learn. Thats it.\r\n\r\nI feel everyday that we have an open culture. At Facebook, we use Workplace, a tool thats kind of like Facebook but for corporations, made by you guessed it... Facebook. Within Workplace, just like normal FB, there are a ton of groups. I'm in a bunch of groups and basically get visibility on decision making + product updates + news from every part of our org. I feel like I'm in the loop and just learn so much about FB / product by reading my Workplace newsfeed. For example, today I read a research report about internet users in India, learned some stuff about dynamic ads, and saw one of the senior leaders announce a new partnership deal. All of that info isn't directly relevant to my day-to-day job, but because its all there and open to anyone, I learn so much and have so much clarity into FB's product vision & company objectives. Mark or Shreyl do Q & A's every Friday. Between hearing top leadership speak, and reading updates from every part of the company on Workplace, I feel that FB is a very open and transparent place to work.\r\n\r\nThere are many other pros and cultural values that I like but let me get to a major pro to end this review. Food!\r\nHere's just a sample from today!  I ate these 3 meals today at the company cafe 2 mins walk away from my desk. \r\n\r\nBreakfast: \r\nSoft Boiled Egg + Been + Cheese + Salsa Tostada. Organic Blueberries & Blackberries. Hemp & Pumpkin seeds.\r\n\r\nLunch:\r\nVegetarian Pho with Sous Vide Eggs, Tofu, Steamed Cabbage, Green Onions, Cilantro, & Bean Sprouts in it. Added Sriracha and Chili Oil to spicen it up.\r\nThai Iced Tea Bobba (Bubble) Tea. \r\n\r\nDinner (today was Jamaican themed):\r\nSweet Potato & Corn Casserole, Collared Greens, Fried Plantains, & Quinoa. \r\nI also got a slice of cheese pizza :)\r\n\r\nDessert: Mango Cheesecake made with Graham Cracker Crust. \r\n\r\nBy the way, the menu rotates, and at the HQ, there are a ton of cafes to choose from so way more options for food are there.", "cons": "Work life balance is tough.

Time will tell if the spur of acquisitions lately are worth it, but he definitely has the balls to act on where he thinks the product is moving.", "cons": "I think it says a lot that I can't think of a lot of cons.

The people at this company genuinely believe they're changing the world by connecting it, and that mission and set of values permeate everything they do.  \r\n\r\n-Unbelievable benefits and compensation.  Seriously, some of their benefits are mind-blowing.  Gym benefits, free (really good) food everywhere, amazing healthcare and family planning and daycare benefits (including a \"baby bonus\"), access to incredible company events and speakers, generous vacation time that they're constantly encouraging you to actually use, the latest phones and computers for work use, on-site doctor and dentist that are actually good...the list goes on and on.  \r\n- Strong company culture and values.  I've never been at a company that lives and breathes a mission so completely.  Am constantly in meetings where coworkers are asking, \"Is this the right decision for the people who use Facebook?\".  Even the way they treat their contingent workers (who receive better benefits than most of the tech sector's contingent employees do) makes this evident; there are internal communication groups where full-time employees are constantly asking what more we could be doing for contingent workers to show our appreciation for their work. Both internally and externally, the \"#shiplove\" mantra is strong here.\r\n-Work/life balance.  You'll see some mixed reviews on this point, but I've been here a year (non-engineering role) and I've never had the level of work/life balance I've had here.  I work a very consistent 9-5, and it's rare when I have to fire up my laptop at home at night or over the weekends.\r\n-Facilities.  It's Facebook!  The campus is gorgeous, and they allow visitors.  Hosting out-of-town friends and family for lunch or dinner is a great perk.\r\n-Efficient and fast.  Fewer politics than many other companies of this size.  A lot of the day-to-day communication and work gets done on the Facebook platform, which is hugely efficient and easy to use system.\r\n-The future!  These guys have their hands in a lot of cookie jars, and are working on some really amazing stuff.  Whether you're working on things like bringing internet access to the third world, virtual reality products, artificial intelligence that will serve peoples' needs, or all of the innovative things that go on inside the regular ol' Facebook app that serves over a billion people a day, chances are you're working on something really cool.\r\n-Women's leadership.  I've also never been at a company that really understands women's needs as much as Facebook does (I think we owe this to the leadership of Sheryl Sandberg, Lori Goler and Maxine Williams).  They encourage an ongoing dialogue about women's issues in the workplace, have mothers' rooms all around campus, encourage us all to take a \"Managing Bias\" course (which is really eye-opening, on many levels) and even host a yearly Women's Leadership Day, which is truly empowering.  They bring in amazing speakers for this event and out of everything I've experienced in my first year here, this was probably the event that stayed with me the most.", "cons": "-Entitlement.  After you've worked here for a while, it's easy to get entitled.  I'd say 95% of employees keep their feet on the ground and appreciative and gracious about the benefits they receive, but the entitlement plus the company's culture of open feedback (\"feedback is a gift\") occasionally breeds inane complaints in internal communication groups.\r\n-That commute.  If you live in SF, you'll have to hike down to Menlo Park, and depending upon where you're coming from and how bad traffic is that day, it could be as bad as 2 hours each day.  The good news:  that's rare, and company-provided transportation options (shuttles with WiFi) make this as easy as possible.  You do get used to it, and your time on the shuttle is your own.

Likewise, if you prefer to be directed by leadership rather than establishing your own direction autonomously, Facebook might be a bad fit for you.

Do not join Facebook simply on the name,  to add it to your resume, or to become wealthy - you will not find this company fulfilling especially in a sales role.\r\n\r\n*Pay is not competitive (for sales) compared to other organizations with a similar footprint. You will likely take a pay cut coming to Facebook, and even with all the great benefits, you still need to pay a mortgage/rent, bills, and future savings. Similar to other organizations, there are two primary types of sellers (Account Managers & Account Executives) at Facebook these roles are basically the same with different titles and pay scales.\r\n*As a seller, you are not properly incentivized to go above & beyond what is expected of you, in many cases if you exceed you're goal it actually hurts your compensation for the future due to the disproportionate weight your achievement is given for the future.  I don't know a soul at the company who doesn't live and breathe what we do (consider this a pro or a con) but every quarter we are expected to work exponentially harder to deliver exponentially greater results while getting paid the same (or less if you are unable to deliver to the goal that was set)\r\n*Management is unfortunately a disappointment - from the VP level down, the sales management team does not add much value.  At the VP/Director level, a vast majority of people do not feel as though this person/people provide inspiration, guidance, or true leadership qualities.  Through a recent reorganization, it seems lack of leadership and inspiration  will only continue to be perpetuated.  This is not meant to be a personal attack on any one specifically, but the irony of working at such a social and high profile company is that the Sales leadership are some of the most uninspiring and unimpressive individuals at the company.\r\n*It feels extremely political.  We have a well documented belief in openness, and cutting through red tape to do whats best for the organization.  At the end of the day, the sales organization does not feel like like it is held to the same standard.  People feel like they have to walk on eggshells about what kind of feedback they provide to their managers or management in general, favoritism from mid level managers to the director level runs rampant - know how to play the game.  Often times decisions feel like they have been made based on what is good for a particular individual (what will make them look good to their own manager) versus what is best for the company and from this view point it appears that it pays off for those people who think of themselves before the company.

Some people at FB told me that work consumed every second of their life (they just couldn\u2019t switch off).

This explains why people work throughout the weekend to make sure they hit a certain amount of finished tasks for that week before the new week starts.

What I have found is that there is a lot of difference in the way different groups function, so if you join as a SWE or as a product manager, your experience may be different.\r\n\r\n1. The work environment is very open and very noisy. There is absolutely no privacy. This becomes more of a bother here because there are so many people now in all of their buildings. The only time when I was able to do any serious work was when I was working from home.\r\n2. As a data engineer, you will be working with a very old version of Hive (0.10 I think). This is the version even before the one with windowing clauses. I was used to working with a better version that also had CBO and I found this limiting. Not only that, if you do this for a year or two you will be at a disadvantage when you switch jobs.\r\n3. The data engineers are at the lowest rung of the pecking order. Some call them 2nd tier engineers. I call them data peons. They do not get any say in the kind of work they get to do. Any grunt work can be passed on to you and because of the way the review system works, they can screw you if you show any displeasure. An example of this is the data visualizations. The data engineer is expected to do that. I never had to do that before. So you will be spending a lot of time doing housekeeping work like making sure the pipelines run, making sure the font and color choices you made on the dashboards are pleasing to the analysts who sit on top of you in the pecking order. And to add insult to injury, the visualization tool is a home grown one and none of the skills you get from using it are going to help you in a future job i.e. if you plan to continue doing visualizations.\r\n4. Data peons are treated differently as compared to software engineers. Whereas on occasion the software engineers get to work exclusively on different projects for up to a month, there is no such options for data peons. So mobility is very very limited.\r\n5. The performance review system is stacked against data peons. Because they are at the lowest rung, most of the people reviewing them are analysts or above. So the analysts are the overlords even when some of them are absolute idiots. The only ones who can survive in this system are ones with a servile attitude and with mediocre talent and ambition.\r\n\r\nSome of these are because of recent org changes.

Work/Life Balance\r\nIf you don't make this boundary clear yourself and actively work on creating it - it will be exploited. Communication is broken in the company so you'll get messenger pings, quip notifications, emails, google doc updates at all hours. They even do long term project planning over chat groups in some teams.\r\n\r\n2. Loads of unnecessary stress/anxiety related issues suffered by employees due to: \r\n(i) Managers fawning over each other showing \"impact\" of their teams - god help you if you don't make them look good or disagree with them. Anonymous reviews come through some of the time and people can say what they want about you.\r\n(ii) Unnecessary fighting between individual contributors due to performance review system. People \"strong arm\" you into doing work when it makes no business sense so it can make them look good.\r\n(iii) Bad reviews stick with you and you'll be treated differently - people are managed out/disappear/don't pass probation all the time. Speaking with friends in other companies FB isn't that attractive anymore and it's reputation is changing in the jobs marketplace.\r\n(iv) Performance reviews for the most part are opinion based (see 3 below) and not work based\r\n(v) Bullying/Level-ism. I've seen so much of it go on here and nothing done.\r\n(vi) Decisions a lot of the time are made from MPK and a lot of the time opinion based and not fact based which is scary. The 'Holier Than Though' engineering 'Move Fast' culture creates loads of chaos and is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3. You are goaled a lot on \"collaboration\" i.e. how much you are liked rather than the work you do or numbers you drive. This is a cult like characteristic where you have to be \"happy\" and \"always on.\" I joined FB to work on projects to drive numbers but all my feedback was about how I got on with other people. Collaboration is important for most companies but it's fake at Facebook due to performance review system.\r\n\r\n4. There are no formal processes for a lot of things in the company. The only analogy I have for Facebook is that it's like a big building, you go inside, peel back the wallpaper and all you will see is the pipes - the walls are missing. It's \"XFN this\" and \"XFN that\" so you reach out to teams to get things done and rely on \"collaboration\" rather than formal processes/business requirements. It's a huge surprise to me how it has gotten this far. I've seen parts of the operation down/backlogged for weeks on end due to bad planning but you can't complain about it because you won't be \"liked.\"\r\n\r\n5.
