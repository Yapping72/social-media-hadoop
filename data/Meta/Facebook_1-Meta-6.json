What this means is that you are working with some of the best people in the world. Also the values that the company believes in truly important. Its great to work for a place that is so open with its Employees. Since Facebook's product is all about Social, the company makes sure that employees feel free to express their opinions. Everyone is encouraged to weigh in on important decisions. The company structure is such that we dont get fancy titles and therefore we end up being more equal.

I started as an early career employee and one of the main reasons I left was because I felt like there was really little investment in my professional and personal growth. I found that Facebook really likes employees that will work hard and make them look good, but they don't care about helping you move up to the next level. There was no clear progression. A part of this is the flat organizational structure, which appeals to some but not to all. \r\n- Very millennial feeling (I'm a millennial too) and can feel extremely unprofessional at times. No line between personal and professional relationships. Again, this is up to personal choice but it didn't feel great to me all the time. \r\n- Cult-like worship of upper management (Mark and Sheryl). They are awesome people to look up to but people are not critical enough of the company all the time. It felt like people were always blind-sided by the flashiness of M-team's messaging. \r\n- Facebook hires a lot of contractors to full-time positions (especially in Austin), which can feel irksome. \r\n- Since the company has grown so much, they need to stop acting like a startup. \r\n- It's easy to do work that isn't actually fulfilling but is necessary to run the company. \r\n- Loved the mission and messaging of the company but didn't feel like my work was impactful in any way, which was an unfortunate feeling. \r\n- Pay is not that good for entry level/early career business side roles. Engineers make a lot more, unsurprisingly. \r\n- This is an engineer-run company, after all. So if you are on the business side, expect to be heavily reliant on engineering resources, which can be extremely draining and frustrating. \r\n- Facebook says it's easy to transition between roles and teams but I found that to not be true. That's another reason why I left. It may be easier on the engineering side. Additionally, being a remote office truly limits your networking and career opportunities (even if they tell you otherwise). \r\n- I had more managers than I could count in one year. The turnover was way too high and I didn't feel like anyone was invested in me. I wasn't growing and as an early career professional, growth is my top priority.\r\n- Facebook is a global company and most of its users are outside of the US. However, the mindset is still extremely American and I frankly found the way in which people talked about users outside of the US to be downright offensive at times. There was no desire to get to deeply understand user behavior and market trends outside of the US. Given how the world economy is trending, Facebook will be in a bad position if employee mindsets don't change. There are companies all over the world (especially in Asia) that are taking over (and have already taken over) the spaces Facebook is trying to break into as of late.\r\n- A combination of unclear expectations and high manager turnover led to not-stellar performance reviews for me. \r\n- People always said I could work on what interested me and what I was good at but whenever I tried to do so, I was shut down."}, {"review_title": "Non-workaholics beware", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Feb 2020", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Menlo Park, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free food.\r\nPay is good.\r\nFriendly people (faked sometimes but not backstabbing in my experience)\r\nFree gadgets from vending machines\r\nNo real owners on code so in theory you can make changes to any team's codebase (it can backfire, though)", "cons": "Up or out culture: if you don't get promoted to certain level in a set time, you're just fired.\r\nPoor work-life balance due to the up or out culture.\r\nIf more seniors in your team are workaholics, you are compared against them harshly.\r\nOncall infra can be nightmare inducing.\r\nAgain, you must really love your what you do and your team if you want to be happy here.\r\nIt's difficult to move to another team if you get a Meets Most rating in a half.

The prime example here is Instant Articles, which was a design-lead initiative to give select news partners the ability to make their articles load fast and render \"natively\" in the mobile apps (spun out of Paper after that got shut down). I can assure you that all the team wanted to make was a beautiful interface \u2014 it was lead by a product designer \u2014 and none of them would've wished to kill ad revenue/contribute to ruining journalism. You can argue that Instant Articles was one in many many steps FB took that ultimately shifted the ability to make money off of news ads from newspapers to FB itself, and lead to today's massive journalism layoffs and click-bait culture (if ya can't get clicks, ya can't get ad views, and ya can't make money). If you ever met the Instant Articles design lead, you'd know all they care about is a good design and polished interactions. But it turns out, just caring about that means you aren't thinking about the potential damage your product can do 4 years down the line."}, {"review_title": "Staying Power", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Nov 2009", "job_title": "Technical Program Management in Palo Alto, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Facebook is exploring some new ground with social networking and its cool to be associated to the innovation", "cons": "People are often not treated fairly as Ego's get big fast when a company grows so quickly.

The sole purpose of them is that someone can write it in their performance review but no one really uses the outcome of the project after that. \r\n- Despite the management saying how international the company is, every decision is still taken by Americans/British/Irish and according to their worldview.

Also it's worth mentioning that a huge majority of managers is Irish/British, and there is little internal mobility for non-natives. \r\n- Performance review is somehow not fair. Technically there are career expectations but if you fulfil all of them, you'll get the lowest score. There are people from certain parts of the world that would be working 16h a day (I'm thinking East Asia in particular) to get the best score so then people from other parts of the world need to work longer as well, otherwise their achievements will look pale compared to those working overtime.

At other jobs you're often blocked sitting at your desk for a few days waiting for access to some repository.\r\n\r\n2. Control over your career.

I have noticed a trend of people working less, hackathons running during the day, etc. I think your average employee is less driven and moves slower than a few years ago.

With the excuse that you should 'focus on impact', people will fight for 'sexy' projects and things that will obtain them a good performance review. Since middle and upper management often do not have a clue about what their own teams actually do, whatever you can make sound important (e.g. with fake metrics or tales of potential impact), you are onto a winner. Unfortunately, the same managers do not enforce a culture of fairness or trust; instead, it is a culture of rewarding back-stabbers and people who 'get the work done' but who, at the same time, treat their colleagues poorly. By that, I mean stealing projects or not giving credit to those who get the work done, for example. It is an awful environment to work in. Some teams are worse than others as well: You could end up reporting into a bad apple who steals projects from you. It happens, and it happens often.\r\n\r\nGood people managers are never rewarded, as people management is not something Facebook recognises as important. Yes, in the orientation they will give you a big speech about it but when was the last time good people managers got promotions? Managers should focus on people, and ICs should focus on things. Unfortunately, bad managers who are good at IC work get rewarded often to the detriment of their teams, who have to suffer under people who should have never become people managers. The so-called Pulse survey is a joke, as no importance is given to low-scoring managers. If 10 people in a team say they would not work with their manager again, something must be wrong, don't you think? \r\n\r\nTo any potential employees: Do not get fooled by the appearances.

Seeing Mark Zuckerberg mature into the great leader he is has been magical, and I have a lot of trust in Sheryl and Mark and Mike Schroepfer to make good decisions.  \r\nIn many ways, engineers are more productive now than they were in 2009, despite the fact that we work at a big company now.

We also launch to hundreds-of-millions-to-billions of users, depending on the product, making our contributions very high-value.  Product launches continue to be driven by bottom-up ideas as much as top-down directives.  That doesn't mean that you personally are going to have an idea which shakes the world, but it does mean that you have a better shot than other companies.\r\nEspecially if you're an infrastructure engineer, the culture is very bottom-up.  You still have great latitude to come up with execute your own ideas.  The flipside of this coin is that if you're not good at deciding what to work on, you'll need to learn that skill within a year or so; management isn't going to spoonfeed you tasks to the extent they do at other large companies.\r\nWhen joining Facebook as an engineer, you will still have many many choices of which team to join, and you'll make that decision after a few weeks of \"bootcamp\" which means you'll have an informed choice.  It also means that the quality of engineers is high throughout the company because every person comes through the same interviewing process.\r\nOne of my favorite aspects of Facebook culture is focusing on impact rather than hard work.
