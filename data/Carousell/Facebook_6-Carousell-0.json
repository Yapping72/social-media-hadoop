Most of the employees here came from worse working environments e.g. Media agencies, toxic local SMEs, Honestbee and hence believe that this grass is a lot greener. If you\u2019ve been through terrible work environments, yes carousell will be (slightly) better. Is it the best place to work in Singapore? Definitely not. \r\n\r\n2. There is autonomy to make decisions that have immediate outcomes and visibility, and on some occasions the founders will be verbally grateful to you for them.\r\n\r\n3. Most people on the ground here are really trying their best to do what they love and work hard. And yes, if you are looking to join the marketplace experience team, or the tech team - you are most likely to enjoy your experience there. Carousell understands that tech is competitive and will do their best to treat tech hires right, not so much for the other departments. \r\n\r\n4. In some departments, there\u2019s a good culture of fun and team bonding. Carousell is intentional about spending time together and bonding, and there will be budget for this too.", "cons": "1. The Carousell group acquired 4 companies over the years - OLX (Philippines), Mudah (Malaysia), Chotot (Vietnam) and OneKyat (Myanmar). There is a lot of mess and neglect in this process and the founders are struggling to understand how to manage them, most people here complain of being overworked, underpaid and under-supported way more than their Carousell counterparts.\r\n\r\n2. Management - the Glassdoor reviews that you read here are true. Even though most of management came from affluent and long standing histories of experience, most of them just want to oppress their reports. They know nothing and want to be treated like royalty - you will be asked to book meeting rooms for them, teach them how to record on zoom/order food on foodpanda, buy things for them and much more. (To be fair, most of the things experienced are in the People team - high turnover rate a clue?) You will be shocked at how they can say words with no accountability and tact, despite their \u201cexperience\u201d. The founders are much younger than most and clearly struggle to manage them - all these incidents mentioned were bought up to the founders and no action taken, resulting in employees resigning because they gave up hope. \r\n\r\n3. As much as they seem to look corporate and SME-like, most people here will admit that it\u2019s still very much like a start up. Little to no processes, constant change in systems and poor communication downstream. \r\n\r\n4. There is a deep systemic resentment towards salary. The context is as a startup, most employees who have been there for years received start up pay. Only up till a year ago, the management decided to pay competitively to new hires and that\u2019s when the bitterness and comparison arose. Imagine only getting half or less of the salary of your counterpart and doing the exact same work - as much as this is common, Carousell is not an MNC and it doesn\u2019t come with any MNC benefits. \r\n\r\n5. Burnout culture: is real here. As much as the people experience team tries to sell \u201cwork life balance\u201d and \u201cWellness Wednesdays\u201d, they don\u2019t actually live it out themselves. You will see the team reply to slack or send emails at 12am-1am, people are angry and uncooperative and being told they lack resilience when they are being pushed to breaking point at work. There is deep mistrust for managers as most of them are deemed inexperienced or incompetent. The people team try to mitigate but everyone can tell that they are struggling with their own manager, too. When asked, most of them are on the lookout for better opportunities and said that they will leave in a heartbeat if the opportunity presents itself."}, {"review_title": "Manager have no clue on how to run a company.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Sales Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "No dress code and nice office", "cons": "Culture: Management like to talk about how important they put people first.

Personally, they don't treat HR folks as a business too so, HR opinion is the last opinion or better still \"no opinion required\" category. Highly bureaucratic/ political and very traditional in their approach and highly judgemental as leaders. \r\n\r\n- Attrition: a pretty high double figure attrition and a lot of people have left in HR /Tech/ product teams, clearly because they felt less heard or the leaders didn't work too hard to retain talent.
