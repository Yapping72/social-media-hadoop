Team was great but Management did not know what work life balance was. There was no such thing as being off work. I believe this was do to our manager never shutting down from work and felt everyone should be the same. Management's life was work, so that meant the same for the team. Also, liked to cause issues between the team and had nothing good to say about anyone. Made it uncomfortable for employees because Management liked gossiping with employees about other team members. \n\nAfter experiencing the leadership style at Anthem twice, I realized it was time to look elsewhere.

This in itself would not be a problem, but Anthem expects you to pull 50-60 hour weeks all the time (not just during a busy season). Whenever someone quits, they refuse to hire a new nurse (they claim it's no longer in the budget, even though it was in the budget to pay this nurse before they quit) and will expect the remaining workers to absorb all the work. It doesn't matter if you're stuck working until midnight. \r\n\r\nIf you try to tell management that you're burned out, or have to log off for a few minutes at 7pm to cook for your family before logging back on until midnight, they will tell you that you're being paid to do a job and it needs to get done. It doesn't matter that you've been working since 8am, you cannot take a few minutes to tend to your family 12 hours later. You better have a good reason for logging off for a bit. \r\n\r\nYou can work 60 hour weeks all the time and get most of your work done, but if you dare to miss one case (because you're just burned out), you will have to send an email to the manager/director telling them why you missed turn around time on this one case and what steps you're taking to ensure it won't happen again. Really? How about recognizing that your workers are actual humans who need a break. No one is perfect and everyone makes mistakes or misses something. \r\n\r\nYou can do 1,000 cases on time, but that one case you missed will be held against you during raise/bonus time. If you dare to take 15 minutes outside of your 30 minute lunch break to give your eyes/brain a rest from the constant work, the manager will IM you \"hi\" and see how long it takes you to respond. He/she will then IM you and ask where were you, why were you away from your computer. This has happened multiple times to me and many of my coworkers. I didn't know I had to ask permission to rest my tired eyes for a minute. \r\n\r\nSome departments are trying to make workers come back in the office. This is just a power grab on their end since the work can be done 100% from home. Also, covid isn't over yet just because Anthem's higher ups want it to be. Some people need to work from home for their health/safety. If one person isn't working up to standard, make them come in. Why punish everyone? \r\n\r\nFor the past 4 years, the director would not allow managers to give employees \"exceeds expectations\" on the annual review. Any manager that gave that score was forced to change it. The director said that we will all stop working hard if we have nothing to strive for. Nothing is good enough for the directors. \r\n\r\nIf you are an efficient worker, you will be punished with more work of those who do not work as quickly as you. The slackers are allowed to do bare minimum, as long as they are overly friendly to the directors and managers. If you are an efficient worker then have a less productive day, you will be questioned endlessly on why you had one bad day. You will never be rewarded for being productive and slackers will never be reprimanded for not being productive. I actually slowed down so I would not have everyone's work dumped on me. They won't give you interesting projects as a reward for efficient work. \r\n\r\nEveryone gets the same raise. If you do great work, you will get the same raise as the slacker. Also, the company will add more work to you so that your raise still averages out to like $20/hr (if you break down the salary into hourly). We felt we did not get paid fairly for all the work that kept getting piled on year after year after year.  They would lay off entire departments then just add the work to the already overworked remaining staff. \r\n\r\nThe office built a recreation room for the upper management. It's like a lounge with a pool table and other fun things. That must have cost as much as hiring 4 or 5 new staff to help us with the overwhelming work. The regular workers are not allowed to use it. \r\n\r\nThey are now mandating people to work holidays when this wasn't part of the job ever before. At first, they asked for volunteers and would give you a day off during the week. Now they are just rotating the holidays. This was supposed to be a no weekend/no holiday job. \r\n\r\nIf the supportive staff make a mistake, it is the nurse's fault. You will be held responsible if one of the supportive staff forget to send a case for denial or if they forget to set up an auth shell for you. We are not their managers but we are held responsible for their work. They are adults and their manager should be managing them, not blaming the nurses. We have our own never ending work to do. If I forget to do my work, I'm blamed (rightfully so), and if the UM rep forgets to do their work, I'm blamed for that too. It's just not fair. \r\n\r\nIf the doctor misspells something in the denial letter, or doesn't deny a case on time, the nurse is at fault (by the manager, not the doctor). We are held responsible for making sure the doctors do their jobs, in addition to doing our job and unofficially supervising the supportive staff. Doctors are higher up than us, why are we responsible for their work?

Some Managers and Directors have grown out of H1B Visa status, their management experience is primarily with subordinates on H1B Visas and some are very rude to their subordinates while very pleasant to peers and higher levels of management.   \r\n\r\n4. The tone that filters down from upper management is threatening. \r\n\r\n5. Frequent reorganization memos announcing executives being replaced and let go. \r\n\r\n6. All corporate changes seem to be pursued in parallel without any planning or prioritization\r\n\r\n7. HR Policies are nice and very thoughtful. However, the HR policies are not applied consistently and in some IT departments, employees are abused by requiring to take PTO for a short family related errand or a doctor's visit even if they work in excess of 55 hours that week.  No one complains or informs HR for fear of retaliation.\r\n\r\n8. The corporate surveys are anonymous but show the answers on a per direct manager level and it is easy for the direct manager and the 2nd level manager to identify or suspect who is the author. All employees are well aware of this fact, have known of cases of retaliation and for this reason they choose not to provide negative feedback via the surveys.\r\n\r\n9. Rightly so, HR's policy establishes that salaries are not affected by H1B Visa status of an employee. However, some directors have their own policy of maintaining salaries of employees with H1B Visa substantially below the on going market rate.  It is difficult to detect this in cases where 90% of the direct reports are H1B visa holders. For this reason, the salary surveys, used to identify the  market rate,  should not include the salaries of H1B Visa holders and this way enabling the comparison. \r\n \r\n10. New employees in particular are vulnerable because they are given and like the policies.  However, they find the hard way that their reality is based on who is their direct boss and not on the written policies. In addition, since a new employee is not aware about rivalries among VPs, it is relatively easy to get caught in feuds. Furthermore, since very few procedures are written and the ones that are written are outdated, the new employees' primary source of knowledge is their direct Manager. If your direct manager inherits you through a reorg, then you are in their hands. You are lucky if your new manager is confident of his position, not afraid of sharing his knowledge and developing new leadership under him. If this is not the case, my advise is to lay low and be a Yes/Yes person, work 60 hours per week, never volunteer information about issues or solutions to anyone but your direct manager.  The frequent RIFs enable all the political moves your direct manager wants to make and this way ensure he is safe from future RIFs."}, {"review_title": "Good company, great benefits--but only if you aren't a \"PermaTemp\"", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Sept 2011", "job_title": "Health Outreach Specialist in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good people, decent company/  Great pay and benefits, provided they actually bother to hire you as their own employee instead of keep you as a permatemp.", "cons": "I worked at Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield for six months through a temp agency.
