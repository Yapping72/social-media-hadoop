You could have the best year or worst year and still get less than a 3% raise. \r\n\r\nWages - Average to below average. Definitely could make more at other companies.\r\n\r\nWork Life Balance - We don't have enough employees to cover our workload and have to work above and beyond to meet our customer's needs. We are supposed to have a 9/80 schedule, but rarely able to have our days off. Couple this with the layoff of our contractors and the recent employee layoffs. We now have a further reduced staff trying to maintain workload. All while we are treated like children and have our 9/80 threatened to be taken away.\r\n\r\nThe Reorg. - This was supposed to be for efficiency however it is anything but efficient and more of just a consolidation and reduction. Many people were demoted not due to performance. To be honest, it isn't clear why some people maintained their positions while better people were demoted. However it is clear that the upper management was making the decisions with zero input from lower management. Also the handling of the reorg. was anything but transparent even though we were supposed to be kept in the loop. Being kept in the loop meant Upper Management sent out a vague list of where each department would be redirected. However most of the departments were excluded from the list without any clarification. Lower management wasn't in the loop at all and found out our employees were being laid off after said employee called to let us know. \r\nPost Reorg. we are still scratching our heads on what just happened and worse off than before the reorg. \r\nIf you had asked before this year what my thoughts were of Kinder, I would have replied that it's a great company to work for.

There is no planning, no communication and the managers are primarily focussed on preserving their careers at all costs. Initiative is discouraged, yet there is no guidance to direct progress. When employees have to take initiative due largely to a \"tenured\" employee shirking their responsibility, that task suddenly becomes the responsibility of the initiative-taker. There is no effort to retrain the ineffective employee or define work responsibilities and hold employees accountable to specific, defined responsibilities. Employees at the lower levels are treated with disdain and animosity when they point out unsafe or inefficient processes or equipment. When something does go wrong, efforts are directed at blaming a low level employee who can be made into a scapegoat and summarily dismissed. There is no significant root-cause analysis conducted, and when it is, the reports are editted to ensure no blame or responsibility falls on the shoulders of the senior reporting managers. Most of the terminals in the lower river region were previously, \"Mom-and-Pop,\" terminals. Consequently, there are a lot of different programs, policies and procedures in place. Maintenance programs are typically ineffective if they exist at all. Work flow and inter-department communication is negligible. There is no effort to create any kind of process standardization. Kinder Morgan, in response to threats of disciplinary action from the EPA, put together a Terminal Asset Group (TAG) that was supposed to standardize equipment, policies and procedures throughout the Bulk and Liquid Terminals. But, as with most things derived from regulatory threat, it has largely fallen by the wayside; giving way to profit margin and management bonus pressures (It is understood that the EPA will not take serious action against a $100 billion energy company). While the upper executive branch puts out well-documented statements calling for quality focus, customer care and above all safety, these seem to only serve the purpose of making sure the Kinder Morgan legal team has a sufficient stack of documentation proving their executives are not liable for the actions of the employees. These philosophical guidelines are never expounded upon or broken down into cogent processes, policies or procedures.\r\n\r\nThis is a very frustrating place to work. If you have any other options I suggest you strongly consider them.
