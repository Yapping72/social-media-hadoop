They expect to take on new product lines and services without any adequate training. If you receive service from any HP technician, 8/10 times you'll be dealing with someone who only understands the very basics of what they're doing. HP doesn't have any specialists because they just throw their bodies at problems to just figure it out on the spot. I left after 8 years only making $21.50 an hour working on Plotters, Printers, POS Systems, Laptops, Computers and Servers. It was a joke. In an economy where food service (no disrespect) was steadily catching up to our wages, I couldn't justify staying there making a 1 to 3% raise annually. It is not a good place to work if you are ambitious and want to be challenged but also COMPENSATED properly for it. I believe you can make it work for you if you manage to negotiate a reasonable starting salary but even then, last I heard $22-23 an hours is ABOUT what they are offering new hires. Can you believe it? Me that had been working there 8 years still wasn't getting that much. I was hired when I was young and optimistic about working for such a reputable company and in the end it did not paid off. It felt like a waste of time and I decided to leave and make a transition to a new industry before it became too late. Also, there is no room for growth anywhere.

This is because I was only there for a year and recently out of college, so I was treated as essentially disposable. This was made more clear to me by how all of the younger employees on my team (4 of them) were gone or leaving within the year. Senior level employees are treated well because they have been around long enough to understand the obscurely written code base and they have established office networks. But junior level employees don\u2019t have a leg to stand on (and no real reason to stay), so there is a very large turnover rate.\r\nOn my project, there was ZERO documentation (not even comments!) and the code is written with variable names that make it essentially unreadable unless you personally wrote it. Instead of being given any sort of support (despite frequently bringing this up to my manager), I was told to just figure it out on my own and then blamed when my progress was slow!\r\nUnlike at other companies I\u2019ve worked at, your managers attend standups and you report your daily progress directly to them, meaning that they are constantly breathing down your necks and micromanaging. \r\nI worked very hard to keep up and my peers gave me glowing reviews for end of year reviews, so much so that I was given an extra bonus for good performance. EVEN SO, my manager was constantly upset with me (and other junior employees) in a way he never was with the senior engineers.\r\nAdditionally, the technology is old and only getting worse. We were migrating to a newer code base that took I think 10 times longer to compile! \r\nIf you are a senior engineer, this is probably an okay place to wait for retirement, but if you are just starting out, this is just a waste of your time.
