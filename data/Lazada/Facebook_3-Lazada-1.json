Lazada is pretty much a well-established brand in SEA. Will look good on your resume.\r\n2. You are currently unemployed and really need the money.\r\n3. You want to experience/learn about e-commerce industry.", "cons": "- If you are currently employed, stay there. Don't accept the offer from Lazada expecting it to be better.\r\n\r\nReasons NOT to accept an offer from Lazada Malaysia:\r\n\r\n1. Top down communication is at its absolute worst, causing frequent changes in directions and instructions.\r\n\r\n2. For an e-commerce giant that's turning 9 years old this year, the management of the organisation is still very much all over the place. Departments and processes have no properly established SOPs with the endless excuse that \"this is a fast pace environment\". Yes, \"CHANGE IS THE ONLY CONSTANT\" (one of Lazada's values), but it should also be expected. Hence, the need for SOPs.\r\n\r\n3. People managing the teams are extremely lacking in people management skills. Managers only talk to you when they need something from you, so they can take credits for the things you do. Otherwise, you don't exist to them. Zero human touch. Credits are sometimes given, but in private.\r\n\r\n4. If you accepted a position in Lazada Malaysia, be prepared to do works entirely out of the scope of your role/experience without any guidance or training for upskilling.\r\n\r\n5. No matter how good you are at what you do, you will never be promoted or recognised if you don't su*k up to the management of your department. Doing your work excellently alone is not enough. You'll experience major career setback.\r\n\r\n6. No one in the organisation can be trusted, not even the HR/People Team. If you have issues, keep it to yourself. Reporting to a higher level or the HR is just a waste of time. If you do, don't expect changes.\r\n\r\n7. Your yearly KPIs will only be given to you 5-6 months into the new financial year. I got mine just 2 days before the deadline of mid-year review submission, and yes, I did ask for it earlier but the answer is always \"waiting for management to review and approve\".\r\n\r\n8. For an industry that relies heavily on their customers (buyers and sellers), their Customer Care department is the LEAST liked department and often overlooked. The head of the department doesn't even put in the effort to elevate the Customer Care department. \r\n\r\n9. The activities organised by the People Team are fun, but very rarely inclusive. Most of the time, you will feel like an outsider looking in. The participants are mostly people from the so called Malaysia Management Team (MMT), HR, Category and Marketing teams.\r\n\r\n10. Campaigns after campaigns after campaigns, it's a vicious cycle. Expect to work at least 12 hours on campaign days for absolutely no reasons. \r\n\r\n11. No matter the achievements on campaign days, don't expect big bonus and increment.\r\n\r\nThe list of cons is endless, but I think I've made my points. I'm only writing this for the sake of my friends who are still stuck there, because they are not able to secure another job yet during this pandemic. Praying they will get an out soon."}, {"review_title": "Great working environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Customer Experience Senior Specialist in Kuala Lumpur", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you are expecting a work environment that offers a lot of learning opportunities, and positive competitive environment, this is a great place to work", "cons": "Salary is too low, low appreciation towards good & loyal employees."}, {"review_title": "Best place to work so far", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Specialist in Ho Chi Minh City", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "big package, friendly environment, transparency", "cons": "can not work remotely, nothing"}, {"review_title": "Good  vibe, work hard, play hard.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Manager in Ho Chi Minh City", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fast pace, people who can adapt will learn a lot and grow quickly. \r\nBenefit a lot from Alibaba Tech which we usually can't find in most of organisation.

Example, the organization structure change in the middle of preparation of big campaign which makes it super hectic and not healthy. Senior management in the local market seems to be hard-headed and does not try to fit with local market culture and characteristics. Regional to local communication is also very bad. Regional tend to be bossy to local market (especially in the business side where local culture matters). The local market CEO is also very hard-headed in these terms and therefore internal communication is super chaotic. Many divisions do not know what to do and what changes are affecting them. As the result, sellers and buyers alike become the victim of these rash decision making, internal communication problem and inconsistent policy. HR is also very bad.
