I basically joined not long ago for a call centre project for a govmt body. And it is poorly led by a very kancheong and least professional project manager.

They will train some of us like 1 wk or less than 4 days and throw u on the ground to answer calls or make out bound calls. LOL to that. - the pressure is on like ur a kid in a sch n not treated like an working adult. - the director of the inchrg project will walk arnd with hands behind her back and walk arnd like a principle to show u her presence. like ur supposed to be very afraid of em. - they're too free to keep auditing n interupting ur calls and reprimand u infront of everyone like u hv no dignity. - theyre super lack of staff. thats y they rush u to be on the ground thats what we all newbies feel. - u will feel very judged and demoralize, all of my trainees feel like dragging their feet to work every single day. - they shudnt even get this person to be the project manager, her body languange is so such a turn off. the TLs are way better than her. Very humble, bet she also donnoe what shes doing. you can tell la shes plastic la chasing the ladder tryna proove her worth where she stand n how she can lead the team given that she just newly got promoted. very AUTHORATIVE. - after yr few subjects of training youre given a test. theres too many subject to absorb in a day, and they dont gve u that ample time to read, understand better or even breathe. - tell off the poor trainer infront of us like he didnt do a good job when hes very supportive and better than her. - tbh everyone is suffocating and complaining abt this new manager and how she handles stuff and even how she react to it. very unprofessional. - we all have feedback to our respective hrs but yet no action taken. - they like to use this \" we cant afford any mistakes\" when their mistake was to put u on ground for less than 4 days training or even 2wks training with too much products to remember -.-"}, {"review_title": "Amazing employer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Consultant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great employer Time management Leadership is good", "cons": "No cons No cons No cons"}, {"review_title": "Competetive Salary", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "18 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Manager in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Competitive salary.
