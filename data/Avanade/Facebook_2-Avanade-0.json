I have been stuck on the bench for several months, watching my career gap grow on my resume and now find myself faced with a difficult choice: either stay with Avanade and watch my career suffer, or quit and struggle financially. A layoff with a severance package (or even just firing me, giving me access to unemployment) would have been the more humane option, but instead, the company has kept me on the bench for months and now presents me with an ultimatum. They fail to take responsibility for over hiring and the impact of the economic downturn on their staffing needs. It is unclear to me how Avanade is still in operation. Other positive reviews may be from long-term employees who were already placed on projects before the economic crash, so they have a vastly different experience. Keep this in mind when considering working here. The only positive aspect is that the company paid me for several months while I was on the bench, allowing me to search for internal and external job opportunities, but the emotional toll and stress of this situation has not been worth it.", "cons": "This is a warning for anyone considering working for this company. The company is currently experiencing a large number of employees on the \"bench,\" meaning that they do not have any real work available and many employees are spending their time interviewing internally and networking for potential projects. Developers are being placed on projects that do not align with their job description and are more suited for business analysts. If you value your career as a developer, you should be aware that working here could lead to a significant gap in your resume and you will not gain valuable skills. While the company may try to downplay the situation, it is likely to negatively impact your career. There are a few technical projects available, but the internal interview process to be placed on one is competitive, and it is unlikely that you will be successful unless you have 5+ years of experience. Keep in mind the date of my post, when the economy improves in the tech sector this situation may change, but for now, even if you are desperate for a job, it is best to continue searching for other opportunities."}, {"review_title": "Good people, good place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good people, good place to work", "cons": "Sometimes you have to hunt your own project."}, {"review_title": "The company is okay, but the client is always right", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Senior Consultant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Technical resources and provide some training for leadership", "cons": "Client is always right.

You can be on the bench for months, then end up at a call center for another four months. Of course, some people (bad developers too) may luck out, and end up in a very good placement, and get a gold ticket to equally good placements moving forward.\n- Too much emphasis on certificates. The Microsoft certificates (value = ~$200 USD) are great if you love having no life after work and memorizing and regurgitating Azure facts. And what more, you can end up with countless virtual certificates later (they tell you tech companies love certificates [this \"fact\" is not backed])\n- Promotions based on certifications. You might be a bad dev, but you'll get promoted sooner with more certificates, than another dev who actually knows how to code.\n- Some of the dumbest developers you'll work with in the industry. They may be 2 - 3 levels above you (god forbid, they might even be managers), and they'll be asking you for help every day. But at the end of the day, they'll earn double your salary and have the final voice on your promotions. \n- Non-transparent promotion standards.\n- Sketchy top tier leadership. Leadership will gossip about YOU. God forbid, you'd better hope you aren't one of the people that they accidentally gossip then \"send all\" to the whole department."}, {"review_title": "Good clients", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "18 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Frankfurt am Main", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lot of opportunity to learn and grow", "cons": "Travel to client locations is difficult"}, {"review_title": "Terrible company - Very disappointed", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Senior Consultant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get lots of time to sit around and study because there is little to no work to do.", "cons": "No structure, mind dumbing due to lack of projects.

You need to prove an exception to get a more powerful one, as if being a software engineer isn't proof enough.\n\nBenefits shifted to be aligned with Accenture. Health Insurance options got A LOT more expensive.\n\nYou have almost no say at all in the projects you go to and the technologies you work with.

Again, you get staffed on projects they want to put you on.\n\nNo clear guidelines on what qualifies you for promotion to the next level. It's drastically different between regions and even changes within a region with each cycle.

It's practically the same process.\n\nThere is a clear leftist agenda. You need to be woke enough to work here. Avanade is in lock step with making sure you jump on that bandwagon. They definitely do that through their townhall meetings (such as their lecture about \"white privilege\" and \"police brutality\", trying to make us feel guilty about it, which was utterly disgraceful) and compliance training, but also through insinuated pressures via other meetings and company-wide emails.
