Instead of promoting you, they will hire new people above you then load them with the same work and volume. \n\nTheir employees of a higher rank can be very fake too. I've encountered an employee who made it look like I was the one at fault and even set up \"proof\" that did not show the whole truth just to make themselves look good. I could not defend myself because I needed something from them in order to fully process my resignation and end all ties with Shopee.

And what does this mean is that if you join, expect to NOT get any knowledge or guidance from the managers as they cannot really educate you. They can only share with you \u201cthe concept on a high-level\u201d and disguise it as \u201cgo figure the rest out yourself\u201d most of the time.\r\n\r\n- Managers generally lack of empathy. Throwing people under the bus and blaming culture is a common behaviour observed among managers and leads. There are also some leads in Marketing who practice double standards - if you do not carry a \u2018lead\u2019 or \u2018manager\u2019 title, they do not really respond to you or bother responding to your questions, may it be in person, SeaTalk (Shopee\u2019s version of WhatsApp) or email. \r\n\r\n- High volume of workload as a result of never-ending campaigns and projects. There\u2019s no such thing as low/high priority here (especially in Marketing). Everything is of high priority and requires attention - doesn\u2019t matter if project is less impactful or has less potential simply because these managers and leads want to appease the bosses above.  Also, expect to work till midnight, weekends, and even on public holidays (Raya, CNY, Christmas).\r\n\r\n- Funny how Shopee prides themselves as a tech company but truth is, a LOT of manual work happens behind the scenes. Simple things such as uploading banners, voucher creation, whitelisting etc requires a large amount of effort but feature updates and improvements nowhere to be heard or often deprioritized. \r\n\r\n- Whatever you read on Glassdoor about Shopee\u2019s attrition rate is true. Turnover rate is sky high and yet nobody is addressing the elephant in the room."}], [{"review_title": "good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Sakes Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "it is good shop to work at", "cons": "it can be bad shifts by karen"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "30 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Project Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good working environment with endless food and berage", "cons": "high pressure and have some communication issue"}, {"review_title": "oevrall good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Business Intelligence in Jakarta", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "learning opportunity\r\nexcellent leaders\r\nstill can be classified as a work life balance\r\nthe office is great (PCP tower)", "cons": "haven't found any cons yet"}, {"review_title": "Not worth the hype.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "25 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "nice people -employees-, nice office, always something to do", "cons": "Wow where should I begin.

People only last 1 year if they don't leave earlier than that. Management/HR doesn't seem to be proactively doing anything about this since they'll just hire replacements.\n-Upper management roles usually filled by expats instead of local talents. This causes a gap in understanding the local market and also affects overall leadership at times. They have little to no knowledge on on-the-ground execution and expect their team members to do things on the snap of a finger. \n-There's a lack in company-wide standardized processes especially with the virtual set up. One team's processes may differ from another. Overall internal communication is a mess, everything is cascaded and announced via Seatalk which is difficult to document and look back on. Too much chat groups with so many stakeholders which could have been easily solved by creating email lists. HR needs to look into this and improve because sometimes the leads themselves are disorganized. \n-No one enters the e-commerce industry not knowing that it's notorious for crazy hours. But management needs to stop glorifying overwork. Please prioritize your employees well-being so they don't eventually burn out. And no, this doesn't mean provide them with more mental health webinars. Revisit the workload distribution. Maybe evaluate if team leads are actually equipped with leadership skills. If a team member is doing 60 hours of OT per month, that doesn't mean he/she is an exemplary employee. That means you need speed up and hire 3 more people ASAP.  \n-Pay gaps. HR will low-ball you if you were paid lower at your previous job even if you have the same experiece as another employee.\n-HR will promise you performance bonuses but it is very very low despite good performance. \n-Management does a lot of questionable things in terms of strategy. The tendency to pivot a lot is given because of stiff competition, but Shopee needs to re-evaluate its intiatives in marketing and not just be reactive to LZD all the time."}, {"review_title": "work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Junior Category Manager in Bangkok", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "lead team\r\npeople are young\r\nwork are fast pace", "cons": "little say to none in direction of platform\r\nalready a corporate"}, {"review_title": "marketing", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Marketing", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to work and build career", "cons": "sometimes a bit overloaded with work"}, {"review_title": "Sucks experience with emotional manager", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Feb 2022", "job_title": "E-commerce Executive in Johor Bahru", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "you can know what is the cctv boss look like", "cons": "Work with the emotional manager (who is the boss) and 24hrs CCTV to check you and listen to your conversation.

Feels like a sales agent role.\n- One campaign hasn't even started, you will be introduced to the next month's campaign. \n- Disorganized, sabog and communication heavily relies on chat app which makes tracking hard. People aren't as responsive in email as to chat app. So you tend to miss announcements and reports. Also, the amount of chat groups is insane.\n- Short term plans. Long term is not visible because it is constantly changing.\n- Chaotic processes leads to unnecessary stress for client facing roles.\n- Pushes A LOT of marketing initiatives.\n- High turnover like <5 people leave in a month per category. Management doesn't really address this since they'll just replace people. People usually last 1 year then leave.\n- A lot in the team, roughly around 80-100. So it's kinda hard to climb up.\n- As an external hire, I'm disappointed because it isn't as efficient as it brands itself, but if you like fast, wear multiple hats, multitask, maybe it's for you.\n- Management says they understand but don't do much about it.

You can try speaking to your boss or HR about issues that you\u2019re facing at work but it\u2019ll only get brushed off.\n\n- Terrible & incompetent teammates. As the company is very flat, many (if not all) your more senior teammates will try to be your mini boss.\n\n- Horrible working culture as there is so much hostility among different teams.\n\n- No training or proper guidance whatsoever and you\u2019re only assigned a buddy at the start to \u201cteach\u201d you. If you\u2019re as unlucky as most, your buddy won\u2019t teach you anything. If you\u2019re a fresh grad, you should run and look elsewhere.\n\n- Crazy bosses who work round the clock, have no life and expect you to be as miserable as them.\n\n- Work for 20 hours & sleep for 4 hours during peak days of big campaigns (i.e. 11.11, 12.12). The best part is that your bosses would act like it\u2019s no big deal that you\u2019re sacrificing your sleep & weekend every month.\n\n- Crazy attrition rate, meaning at least 1 of your team member would leave the company every month. Even though the company is hiring aggressively, it\u2019s a waste of time having to train & retrain your colleagues since most people will leave rather quickly.\n\n- Company\u2019s only long-term mission is to beat Lazada out of the market. \n\n- Manual workflows that require intensive human labour.
