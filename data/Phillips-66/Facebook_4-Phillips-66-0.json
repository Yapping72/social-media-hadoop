This is because they rely on engineers/salary employees for everything and are the only ones held accountable when things go wrong. The expectations are the highest. They lure you in with a decent starting salary, but keep you at the top of your pay grade. This means at the end of every year your raise gets smaller and smaller. I was hired in at 2-3 salary grades below my actual years of experience and capability. The expected overtime hours required to keep the refinery running make your salary not worth your time. In the end you make less money because you spend the majority of your life at work. Refineries have toilets that do not flush yet the Coporate HQ has all the luxuries and amenities you could think of. The Refinery Leadership Team (top managers of the refinery) typically have short term mentalities. They don\u2019t really care about the site or native people in the long run. They\u2019re looking to cut some costs somewhere to look like a hero so they can move to their next promotion or refinery. Meanwhile, the native employees have to live with these poor decisions for the rest of their career. Phillips 66 loves spending millions of dollars on stupid trinket technology or software. However, they won\u2019t spend any money to hire more people to make sure their millions of dollars of investment actually can be used or make an impact. The refineries are also very petty about watching your time in the gate despite the fact that most employees work 10-20 hours OT weekly. The refineries will do anything to keep from going over their maintenance budget, even if it means spending double their budget. Yes, they\u2019d rather rework a job numerous times than spend the money to do it right the first time. Human Resources thinks and treats employees like there is a line of willing and qualified people lined up to replace you. However, their job postings and turnover rate show otherwise.

As with any workplace, there are people who have either a highly positive or negative attitude. I loved working with many of my coworkers and managers. They were some of the best that I have experienced. Some coworkers are also the most toxic I have ever experienced. This job tends to bring out the two extremes in people, more so than other jobs. The camaraderie between shift workers can be highly rewarding, and form lifelong friends, or extremely toxic depending on how you make it, and how your colleagues make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Well paying if you are hired as a permanent employee. If you can find a union position then the pay is significantly higher than you would find for equivalent job roles outside of an oil refinery. Overtime pay adds up quickly and can be substantial. But the high pay comes at a price. Many coworkers who have worked for this company for 25+ years describe the pay as a \"golden cage\" (more on that below)\r\n\r\n-Highly Professional approach to safety and industry best practices. Every single day we had a safety meeting to brief the team on possible hazards and precautions needed for best practice. This is possibly the single most positive skill I took with me from this company to another industry. Many other companies in other industries will not have the same high standards for safety the the Oil Industry has. It can be a dangerous job and as such the company holds the highest standards possible for safety and professionalism. There is zero tolerance for unsafe work practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n-wide range of technical and practical hands-on skills and training which you can learn\r\n\r\n-It doesn't get much \"bigger\" than \"Big Oil\", almost any other company you join afterwards will not be dealing with volume or throughput quantities as large as Big Oil. Think small margin, high volume. It is high stakes. When you make a small mistake, it can affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Efficiency is key. This is valuable experience moving to another industry.\r\n\r\n-Pro/Con, there is a high standard for consistency and professionalism in the company. The oil refinery produces an unfathomable amount of product every single hour of every single day. When you make a mistake, it could affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Management is generally practical and understanding most of the time but not always. Mistakes happen, but generally they emphasize learning and growing from the mistakes. Sometimes, this is not the case and management can be toxic. Nevertheless, it can be stressful being in a routine high-pressure position knowing your mistake could have an immediate impact on thousands of gallons of product.", "cons": "-A lot of tension and drama between the workers union and management. \r\n\r\n-The refinery never stops except in the case of an extreme natural disaster (earthquake, hurricane). Otherwise, if there is a snowstorm or blizzard, be prepared to sleep on a cot and stay at the refinery (forget about your family at home). \r\n\r\n\r\n-Shift work. Unless you are one of the rare positions which do not require shift work (i.e. engineering, office work, supervisor, management). Otherwise most of the workers on site are required to work rotating Day/Night shifts. If you work as an operator, a laboratory technician, or any skilled worker (plumber, electrician) then it is shift work. Most of the jobs which allow the oil refinery to run continuously 24/7 are shift work jobs. Did I mention that this job has shift work?\r\n\r\n\r\n-Precarious work/life balance for shift workers. The refinery must run 24/7, no questions asked. This means if you are a shift worker there are no \"holidays\" in a traditional sense. Your schedule is a 14 day pattern that repeats until you retire or leave. The schedule is generally: two days on, two days off, three days on, two days off, two days on, three days off, repeat. If your schedule says you work on Christmas eve, then you are working on Christmas eve. If your schedule says you are working on a wedding or birth of a child or other important event, you are working unless you use a vacation day. Which brings me to the next point...\r\n\r\n-You can be forced to work. If you are a union employee, part of the contract you sign is an agreement to be \"forced\" to work. Yes, there is paid vacation for permanent employees (but not for temp workers, more on that below). When you take a paid vacation, other people must cover your shift. But sometimes, due to the rotating shift schedule, only a small handful of workers can actually cover that shift, and if there are any schedule conflicts then the company resorts to a \"force list\" to FORCE you to work. If somebody calls out, you can be FORCED to go to work. There is a \"force list\" and every worker trained for that same role gets put on the list. When a shift needs to be \"forced\" on someone, they get bumped down in priority on the force list, so the next person who hasn't been \"forced\" in awhile will be \"forced\" next. Scheduled an appointment? Nope, sorry you have to come in. Groomsman or bridesmaid? Better cross your fingers and hope that the day of the wedding you don't get a phone call that you have to come in. Caveat: if you have a good relationship with your coworkers and/or manager/supervisor they are often more than willing to work around this. I was lucky to work with a team where we tried to make sure nobody got forced to come in if they had important events. However the rules are the rules and there is always the possibility you have to be forced to come in once it is \"your turn\". \r\n\r\n-There is a constant paranoia of being called in to work, even on your \"days off\". The only way to be 99% certain that you will not be called in to work is to take a vacation day, and even then...emergencies happen and you may be called in.\r\n\r\n\r\n-It can feel like a \"golden cage\". It is exceedingly difficult to find equivalent pay for the same position outside of the oil refinery. So the retention rate is high if you are hired directly as a permanent employee. Many people stay for 20-30+ years. Almost everyone stays for the pay and the stability of working in a union. However many years of shift work can take a psychological and emotional toll on some people. Some people can be very (justifiably) jaded after 25+ years. \r\n\r\n\r\n-The high pay means upper management expects all of the above is \"par for the course\". AKA \"You signed up for this, take it or leave it\"\r\n\r\n\r\n-If you are hired as a temporary worker via contracting agency, you are expected to work the same hours and perform the same tasks as a permanently hired Phillips 66 employee. This may have changed since I left but during my tenure at the company, I was originally hired as a temporary worker and I was expected to work the same job, the same shifts, and be on the same \"force list\" as the union workers. Some temps have worked 2+ years before being hired. It is the worst of both worlds. You don't get the pay, vacation, or benefits (insurance, retirement etc.) of a permanent employee, yet you suffer all of the negatives of the shift work.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Virtually no upward mobility. Especially if you join the union. Yes, there is a payscale progression, but once you are in the union that's it. You are an operator/Technician for life. You can maybe be a production supervisor someday but that's about it as far as \"upward mobility\". Upper management generally never hires from \"the union\"."}, {"review_title": "Wonderful company to work for!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Staff Analyst in Bartlesville, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits are great.

Base salaries may not be on par with Google, but additional benefits add up fast. Bonuses are usually 10% and often better, up to 25% of base.

The company offers a dollar-for-dollar match on 401k contributions worth up to 6% of your base salary, which is outrageously high for the private sector. And on top of that, P66 has the white rhino of private sector benefits: a pension, and it vests after just 3 years at the company. Additionally, that pension plan includes more stock options, called \"Success Shares\" that are dropped into your retirement account based on the overall performance of the business. Altogether, these financial benefits can easily be valued at 50% of your base salary, and the longer you stay, the better it gets. With the exception of refineries in New Jersey and California, most offices and facilities are in relatively low-tax, low-cost-of-living locations (especially HQ in Texas, a state with no personal income tax). \r\n\r\nSince the company is situated in the \"midstream\" (pipelines) and \"downstream\" (refineries, retail) segments of the energy industry, its stock price isn't heavily dependent on the price of oil; it's a company that takes oil & gas in, and then sends it back out as a new product, taking a relatively consistent margin all the time. This protects the firm's value - and therefore the value of your RSUs - against most market volatility.  \r\n\r\nYes, the company loves to talk up its employee-centric culture.

An investigation team may identify systemic gaps and recommend specific ways to improve, but management will often disproportionately assign responsibility to an individual.  This has led to reoccurance of similar incidents and the same facility as well as throughout the company.\r\nCompany standards are poorly written (i.e. LOPA) and conflict with the very regulations they are \"based\" on.  When senior management is informed of this discrepancy by an 3rd party expert, the response is \"well I'm going to follow the company standard.\"\r\nAlong those lines, management seems to have more emphasis on meeting metrics than actually doing what's right.  The implied message is \"I care more about my career than I do about what's right.\"\r\nAt the same time, I've always felt safe walking around the facilities I've worked at.  It's just a shame the company is so slow to learn from it's mistakes.\r\n\r\nCompany does not clearly link promotion criteria with performance and managers do not evn know the promotion criteria.  There are documented qualifications a salaried employee must meet for promotion (i.e. years of experience, performance history, organizational impact, etc).  Managers have regularly misquoted the qualifications.  Employees may have exemplary performance, but are not promoted in a timely manner.  Some employees have been told \"yes, you meet the criteria but we have a metric to meet so we can't promote you until someone retires or resigns.\"\r\nCompany generally does not offer alternative work schedules (i.e. 9/80s).  Some locations have grandfathered flex schedules, but the rest do not and will not.  One of the members on the executive leadership team is blatantly against flex schedules ('you already work >9 hrs per day, but for 5 days a week, so why would I give you a free day off?').\r\nAnd management wonders why employees leave the company and how to retain talent...it's unfortunate really.  Truly, one individual on the executive leadership team sees people as tools who can be worked as hard as he wants without any additional compensation.\r\n\r\nOpportunities to change positions exist because of high turnover in the organization.  People (particularly those in the 3-10 yr experience range) are leaving the company for competitors that offer better benefits, i.e. higher pay and flex schedules.  Management at facilities with high turnover refuse to let employees relocate because the facility already can't retain employees.  Those employees then leave the company.\r\nHeadcount is definitely an issue.  The staffing levels at many facilities are significantly lower than the levels at similar companies.  When people leave P66, they generally go to those other companies.\r\nDevelopment is almost entirely self-driven.  The company offers very little formal training to help employees grow.  At least the company is changing that.  New training programs have already been implemented and more are being developed.\r\n\r\nThe company really is a decent place to work.  If management paid less attention to their careers and more attention to making improvements, the company consistently and clearly linked promotion and performance, and implement flex schedules, P66 would be an outstanding place to work."}, {"review_title": "Great company with lots of opportunity", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Procurement in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Phillips 66 is a large financially stable refining, marketing, and transportation company of oil and gas products.\r\nPhillips 66 provides employees with plenty of opportunity to change into other jobs especially if they are open to relocating.\r\nPhillips 66 has excellent benefits and reasonable pay.", "cons": "Phillips 66 has a big company culture and mentality; so it is not for everyone.\r\nThe Phillips 66 organization is very hierarchical with lots of layers of management.\r\nPhillips 66 is very policy and procedure driven to the point of redundant processes and inefficiencies; but overall it seems to be working."}, {"review_title": "Great pay, but...", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The compensation package is excellent.
