Additionally, some orgs have little control of the outcomes of their projects, but are judged by results rather than contribution. If everyone is good, some people still have to get low marks, where politics is particularly prominent.\r\n\r\n#3 - Work/Life Balance / Stress  - Working at Uber is extremely stressful. Every decision you want to make is challenged thoroughly and rigorously and there are constantly people that are \"toe-stepping\" on you to ensure the best decision is made. While this is great for the company, on an individual level, it leads to very stressful situations where you must constantly prove everything you do and justify it. \r\n\r\n#4 - People Last Mentality - The company makes no secret from the CEO and down that everything it does should prioritize the company first, and the person later. HR has been neglected, with recruiters consistently overhyping potential compensation. New policies are constantly put in place that undermine the employee (e.g. changing an employee perk so that it is as underutilized as possible).\r\n\r\n#5 - Compensation & Hiring Process - Newer employers (2015+) are routinely under-compensated with potentially misleading guidance on the \"upside\" potential of a high valuation.

Ask two managers the same thing and you are likely to get two different answers. No consistency with scheduling or flexibility. Your experience with scheduling will depend on your manager. Some want you to be available when they say, regardless of your other obligations, while other managers have respect for work-life balance. In addition, there are way too many 12-hour shifts scheduled. This is unacceptable to me. 12-hour shifts should be reserved for those who volunteer and should be rewarded appropriately. If no-one steps up then figure something else out. Scheduling 12-hour shifts shows no regard to the employee. \r\n\r\nFor the remote customer service position, we were trained for two weeks, which is sufficient. However, after that you are pretty much left to the wolves. They say you are free to ask questions, but everyone is literally ghost once you end training. They  have a chat system that is for the birds! During training it seems great. However, you will ask a question once you are on \"the floor\" and will get crickets. You will ping a manager for help and get crickets! Then when you look up, the manager has logged out of the chat system. Really?!! So then your only resort is to email a manager and their response is that email is not a good way to get help. How the heck am I supposed to get help when a manager is not around to chat or they ignore my chats?? I understand that not all managers are available 24-7 but the ones that are need to respond. And I shouldn't be chastised for seeking other resources. I'm not sure what I expected, the team leads (most of them, not all) seem rather robotic and boring. Seems like they may not like their jobs, this would explain no one going out of their way to help. \r\n\r\nIf you've been working low-paying jobs then  you may put up with these issues, but this is really only a decent salary and I've made more than double what they in a previous career.

Engineers are the last filter between a product's idea and its implementation, and so the responsibility falls on them to account for not only product edge cases, but gaps in design documentation (which is never formalized, and usually just a set of slides that requires a follow-up meeting or three to clarify), and team workflow.\r\n\r\nIn short, the culture is that if anything gets in your way, if there's any blocker you hit, if anything at all is unclear, that is YOUR sole responsibility to surmount.

I am the newest employee in a Greenlight Hub location. I was a partner \"driver\" for Uber previously and really fell in love with the company and the platform. Now that I have been an employee of the company it has completely changed my outlook. I have been employed with Uber since July 27th 2017. Since my initial week of training off the floor, I have yet to receive any further training from any level of management. I have not and currently do not receive one on one training nor have I been coached or developed to pursue a career path within the company. I am however expected to produce positive metric without any additional training or support. There is no growth opportunity. I am not assigned projects or any special assignments that are outside of my normal job duties that would allow me to learn something new about company processes and procedures. Here in our Greenlight Hub it is a consistent issue to get a supervisor or manager to speak to a partner that is requesting to speak with a manager. I have heard multiple different things about company policy. For example, I was originally told that I could be negative forty hours for my vacation time and negative forty hours for sick time. I was just sent an email from my supervisor that I am almost negative forty for the year. I have a medical condition and need to see my doctor as often as once a week. If I\u2019m not able to take the time off that I need to use my benefits and take care of my personal health that ends up not being a perk working for Uber. . In the same email, I felt it was insinuated that I am abusing the sick time. I contacted my Greenlight Hub manager and told her I would be providing a doctor\u2019s note for each approved sick time so that it is documented that I DID, in fact, have medical appointments and I am NOT abusing the companies sick time policy. I was then told by my supervisors that they didnt care what I use sick time for. \"If you want to go to Paris on sick time we dont care.\" Is exactly what was said. Overall the Greenlight hub location where I work is a toxic work environment. My coworkers are discriminatory against me. I walk in the hub in the morning to music blasting that talks about women in a derogatory manner the music also says racial slurs. Very unprofessional. I walk over to a spot at the desk to set up my laptop for the day and I watch my coworkers converse amongst each other not to have anyone say good morning to me and have been blatantly ignored. For example, I came back from being out of the hub for 11 days and when I came back from vacation on the morning of 10/31/2017 not a single one of my coworkers said anything to me when I walked in as they all hung out with each other before we opened. When I talked to my supervisor about it, I asked her \"if she thought it was normal behavior to be out of the office for a week to then come back and not have anyone say anything to you?\" My supervisor would not answer my question. Another example is, I came in one morning and got my laptop set up, walked to the back office where two coworkers where sitting at a community table in the back office talking and eating breakfast. I asked if I could join them, One of my coworkers gave me nasty look and then continued her conversation with the other employee. I sat down at the table and was not acknowledge the rest of the time. I found out that there was a company paid employee outing that I was not even told about and just found out after it happened. Another coworker told me that she and a few other people were talking and that it wouldn't surprise them if I got promoted before anyone else because of my race. There are other grievances that I have with the company but the discrimination and hate that I walk into every day has affected my well-being and mental health to the point that I dread coming into work every day.

The main reason being the very negative corporate culture and the poor people management skills of its top management.\r\n\r\n1) Uber is severely understaffed and desperately tries to get people in all areas - and it notably lacks good leaders. Traditionally Uber promotes purely based on operational results. Unfortunately, the best managers aren't necessarily the best leaders. My direct manager specifically was one of the worst people managers I've ever encountered throughout my career (although he apparently did bring in good results in his past role).\r\n2) Uber had to hire so fast that building a sustainable corporate culture hasn't been much of a priority. Uber naturally would argue otherwise not add a Mary of fact for anyone who had worked for a top company before (be it consulting, FMCG or tech) will be heavily disappointed by the lack of common spirit in the company. Some call Uber's culture toxic. I would rather consider that it lacks one altogether.\r\n2) Feedback is super unstructured. I personally am a strong believer that feedback is one of the best ways to learn and improve on a daily basis. Unfortunately, although Uber has a very extensive bi-annual feedback procedure it's not a very helpful one. Additionally, in my case my direct manager couldn't have cared less about providing feedback, even going as far as stating \"please do not ask me again for feedback outside the formal process\". That's an absolute no.go.\r\n3) Since feedback is unstructured, also performance reviews are very intransparent. The bonus (which makes a significant part of the salary) is distributed solely by the direct manager and does not necessarily have to be linked to the targets, since they are anyway moving all the time. That's a problem since it skews the bonus payments towards people who have been around the longest and is biased against new comers.\r\n4) Good leaders leave the company, the bad ones stay. Uber has seen an unbelievable amount of fluctuation in the past 12 months, both forced (= firing) as well us voluntary. On average a new hire only spends less than 2 years with Uber (that's significantly lower that with other Tech companies, such as Google, notably for senior positions). Additionally, people who leave very often have one thing in common: They are looking back with mixed and negative feelings.
