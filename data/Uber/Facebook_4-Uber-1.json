They micromanagement is way out of control, if they could measure you off how many times you blink they would. Management here has terrible communication and instead of managing and leading teams, they simply tell you what to do and demand results. Sales managers with little to no sales experience, and did I mention lack luster training? Uber has the \"learn your own way model\" which is utter BS. No support or coaching from anyone and you often have to fend for yourself. Top sellers get fed accounts, and sell into other territories often when Management wants them to. They have this churn and burn mentality when it comes to sales representatives and it completely shows. A majority of reps never hit the quota metrics and yet they still constantly throw things down your throat to do that goes beyond your own job description. A majority of the reps do not enjoy working for the company and consider leaving. I have never seen a company have such a quick turnover in reps, and it is a testament to their company culture... but hey you get free food and get to play ping pong right?

I've experienced it personally, and seen other employees experience it. This creates a really bad turnover experience a couple times a year once the perf process ends. Simply put, the people who didn't get the raise/promo they feel they deserved spend the next few months seeking it elsewhere. I've seen people get pay raises for lateral moves just by going to another company that values them more. That is partially due to the perf process not working the way it should. \n\nIf you work here, or want to work here, there's a simple formula for getting a raise or promotion. Here it is:\nBecome buddies with your boss. \nTell your boss everything you do. Even if it's something small like \"Hey, I made a new column on your google sheet!\". Apparently communication is overvalued that much. Communicate and document everything you do. Create an archive of all your work. Again, it's less quality and more quantity. When the perf period comes up, you now have your boss on your side and a huge running doc of all the little things you did.\n\nWho do you ask for your peer review? Someone who will give honest, unbiased feedback? No way! Ask 1 buddy that works on your direct team, 1-2 buddies that aren't on the same team but in the same department, and 1-2 buddies that are in another department. If they don't know what you do, just send them your doc you've been working on for months! They can use whatever they need. Boom, you've got the promo! Congrats! Your middling performance doesn't matter, because you've mastered the system! Work smart, not hard (I use the word 'work' lightly). \n\nMaybe I sound bitter, but Uber has such potential that it hurts to see the culture being ruined the way it does. Oh and don't even get me started on the demographic breakdown. Outside looking in, the breakdown might look ok. The levels aren't disclosed though. It's safe to say 90% of the non-white employee is in a level 1 role. If you're new to this, a level 1 role just means that they have a job until a higher up department finds a way to outsource it.\n\n\nLast thing I want to share is the execs transparency is non-existent. Something 100% isn't happening until it is. Something 100% is happening until it isn't. I get that companies have to turn the lights out on things sometimes, but why speak in absolutes if you aren't sure yourselves? Covid is a perfect example. Uber was absolutely not laying off or cancelling PERFs. Next week they do their first layoff wave of many. We get that Uber couldn't afford to keep so many people on when the business took such a hit, but why share news so confidently that you went back on within days? CEOs get paid the big bucks to be able to control situations no matter how tough. People were going CRAZY when Covid hit because the writing was on the wall, but execs were lying. Just flat out lying. Why have so many execs resigned? Transparency. I find it ironic that Uber prides itself on transparency with prices and safety, but doesn't really hold true on the inside. It's like a pi\u00f1ata full of garbage."}, {"review_title": "Not great but I'm still here", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Community Support Services in Limerick, Limerick", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits are good enough.
