However, the tenured folks there still had that \"move fast, break things\" mentality without realizing that now their mistakes have a cascading affect across 100s of people working in their org. I'd like to have seen more strategic and intentional decisions versus experiments (sometimes even ignoring data) based on \"intuition.\"  I also continued to see people being handed roles only because they were there at the right place, right time. \r\n\r\nMiddle management was the worst I've seen with first-time managers who had little understanding of how they should serve their team. There was no trust between my team and my manager although we got along well outside of work. With this type of management, there was no accountability into one's work and very little (if at all) individual goals.\r\n\r\nDara's All Hands were usually inspirational,  but I rarely felt proud about my work.

While knowing that there is no remuneration on the performance !!!!!!\r\n\r\nLet's go into details now.\r\n\r\n1- Lies from the recruiters\r\n\r\nRecruiters tell us that they are looking for talented people who really want to pursue a career in the company with a real evolution within Uber.\r\nBesides that, it is specified during the recruitment that the Sales Representatives will have a remuneration on their performance every 3 months that can reach up to 20% of their salary.\r\nIn reality, the performance bonus is revised downwards by Uber, which justifies the reduction of the initial bonus by a lot of superfluous criteria and this bonus will never be paid after 3 months but at the earliest 6 months after your starting date and some will have to wait until 8 months to receive it.\r\nIn reality, Uber uses this fake performance bonus as a retention bonus.\r\nRecall that this bonus is a weak incentive because it represents only a handful of euros for months of waiting.\r\nIt is worth remembering that the Uber Sales Rep entry contract is only 6 months, which forces the employee to renew his contract to receive the bonus. Otherwise, he will never receive his \"performance bonus\".\r\nFinally, Uber is selling itself as a \"start-up\" atmosphere when in reality this is a bureaucratic environment to its paroxysm\r\n\r\n\r\n2 - No recognition\r\n\r\nIn the offices in Lisbon, most Uber employees are Customer Support Representatives\r\nThe management makes no distinction between a Customer Support Representative and the Sales Team. Whether in terms of wages, or regarding the inflexibility of work schedules, the remote working is prohibited of course.\r\nFurthermore, doing customer service or sales does not require at all the same degree of education or qualification ...\r\n\r\n3 - Toxic management.\r\n\r\nWith very low wages, outside the reality of the market Uber lays the foundation for an environment in which pressure and frustration will prevail.\r\nA constant pressure from the managers to overachieve the target, while we are not given anything in return.\r\nNot only are we asked to exceed the objectives but in addition to work on additional projects outside our contractual functions and all this while avoiding asking for overtime.\r\nMany promises are made but very few are kept. Uber's strategy is to promise promotions, or bonuses to keep employees. Then the bonuses are permanently pushed back and the promotions given to a handful of people.\r\nUber does not reward its most successful employees but reward the most docile ...\r\n\r\n\r\nI have never seen a company in which more than 80% of sales employees are dissatisfied with their job and for most of them are looking for opportunities to leave Uber.\r\nAt the time I write these words (1 week after my resignation) already 4 other colleagues have resigned (the sales team is less than 20 people ...)\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nUber abuses its brand image to attract overqualified profiles for the tasks they will be given\r\nNo bargaining power. Being a Sales Representative at Uber boils down to dealing with administrative tasks while reciting the same word-for-word pitch all day long.\r\nIf you are an ambitious salesman go your way, Uber will bring you only regrets and disappointments"}, {"review_title": "Laid back environment, Pay depending on what you put into it.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Analytics in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A really open working environment exists there, the kind of environment that you would assume a silicon valley tech giant would have.

Over the years they've slowly kicked greenlight out of the big picture. Making staff easily replaceable. Running offices on the bare minimum. Even when there's a protest. No security. No care for experts. London is the only thing that matters in the UK. Slowly taking all the perks away because Ubers gotta make some money somewhere. Maybe stop giving incentives to drivers and actually care for your own staff? Experts are constantly doing other people's work. Lowest paid role in the company but you're doing the most work. Doesn't make any sense to me? \r\n\r\nEvery expert has to clock in and clock out of every single activity throughout the day. Even on lunch! It's disgusting that managers want this all recorded. Picking people out when they're not \"pushing their weight\". Getting spoken to like crap when you clock in 2 minutes late. \r\n\r\nLondon license is the only thing anyone cares about anymore. Stop trying to #findthemoney and invest in your staff. People who have been there since year 1. Launching products and earning the big bosses millions. What did we get in return? A stock option that's fallen through the floor. \r\n\r\nPeople in Aldgate tower know nothing about private hire. They literally sit in their glass tower telling experts what to do. What calling campaign to work on. What hub to cover because they don't have enough staff because they've all left! Banning hubs from hiring new staff so you've got 2/3 members of staff looking after thousands of drivers per city. IT'S NOT SAFE. You stand up to safety when it comes to riders but couldn't give a damn about your staff safety. \r\n\r\nThey'd rather spend \u00a322,000 on a self check outs for all the offices than to give staff a proper bonus. Replacing greenlight staff with a computer hooked up to cheap labourers in the Philippines is not the way to do this. You've got support staff that haven't got a clue about UK laws or private hire laws. \r\n\r\nDrivers were treated better than the support staff. Making support staff wait over half a year for a bonus that was nothing compared to the drivers bonus is a real kick in the teeth. Drivers got their bonus instantly. \r\n\r\nYou wouldn't be pulling in millions a week if it wasn't for these experts that joined all these drivers up. With calling campaigns, bringing them through the driver funnel getting them licensed and onboarding them. We are the face of company. We are why Uber is taking in millions.

And if you are waiting for them to aprove a document, or something else, then be prepared to not make any money for at least a week.\r\nAre they amateurs? Badly trained? Doing it on purpose? Maybe a combination of those factors. But truly irritating.\r\n\r\nUber loves to spend less money with essential things, and line their pockets more and more, while passing on the cost TO YOU, THE DRIVER.\r\nThey know many of their drivers don't even understand or want to know about this, since this is a job WITHOUT INTERVIEW, they let ANYONE IN, even people with NO ENGLISH or basic skills. This is FACT.\r\n\r\nThey took away the ability for their drivers to CALL IN and talk to a human being on the phone. They rather you use the internet (only on the app, not on any browser though..) to navigate through the maze of FAQs and find the hidden SEND US A MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nThey have nothing but complaints from customers too, just go look at their reviews and social media pages.\r\n\r\nDuring COVID times, they took even longer to reply/help their workers, which is the worst time to do that.\r\nAlso, the CEO of Uber doesnt want to treat the workers as employees, but during COVID, the CEO asked THE US GOVERNMENT FOR A BAILOUT, which means he wants the taxpayers to give money to these gig workers, for sick pay, etc. YES, this is the world you live in, with these shameless soulless corporations/companies.\r\n\r\nWe are all humans and from our paycheck, we have (but most don't) to set money aside for many things that Uber doesn't pay for.\r\nLike vehicle depreciation.\r\nVehicle Tax.\r\nFuel/electricity.\r\nMOT.\r\nIncome tax (registering as self employed).\r\nNational insurance contribution.\r\nAll of these things, you have to pay for, with the salary you receive.\r\n(gross and net income, look it up if you dont know about it, because most drivers have NO IDEA about it, most are immigrants who dont care).\r\nSo your net income ends up being A LOT LESS because Uber wants more money for themselves and less for you.\r\n\r\nThere's more!\r\n\r\nThere are MANY restaurants that break the rules and nothing ever happens.\r\nUber's complaint process is non existant. I mean, you can complain, but you know nothing happens, and if you talk too much, like I'm doing, THEY TRACK YOU AND TERMINATE YOUR CONTRACT, so complaining actually does you harm!\r\nRestaurants that have 5 plus drivers waiting inside, because these greedy cnts receive an order and dont even wait a bit before requesting a driver.\r\nSo you end up waiting 30mins plus FOR ONE ORDER (delivery).\r\nUnderstand? The online order goes from the customer to the restaurant, and the restaurant then IMMEDIATELY requests the driver to come and PICK IT UP, but the food is FAR FROM READY, so you end up waiting and losing time (MONEY) or simply cancelling the order and wasting Fuel.\r\nOh, you can get punished for not accepting many orders or cancelling many orders.\r\nWhy? If we are truly self employed, we are supposed to be able to CHOOSE what restaurants we want and dont want to go, etc.\r\n\r\nThere's way more but who cares, right? No one will even read or care about this, the CEO is getting richer, nothing changes, we die, repeat cycle.\r\n\r\nSo to sum it up, they exploit mainly immigrant workers, calling them PARTNERS and classifying the workers as CONTRACTORS and SELF EMPLOYED, when in reality, YOU ARE NOT SELF EMPLOYED, since it goes against 90% of what SELF EMPLOYED actually is.\r\n\r\nOh, they recently got together (lyft, uber, etc) and spent a lot of money to LOBBY and go against a ruling in california.

The management are terrible, I can't even fathom as to why they had been promoted as they are completely computer illiterate, one member of management actually asked agents how to copy and paste for a technology company this is preposterous. \r\n\r\nThe reason for management being so incompetent is that the hiring panel for promotions is held by their close friends who they had started out with.
