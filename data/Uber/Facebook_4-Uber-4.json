After a year to 18 months I would be considered for the new role I originally applied for. Trusting that they knew the challenges better than I did, I decided to give it a chance but upon joining realized that the role offered was not going to be what I thought it was. Speaking with senior and executive leadership did not lead to any substantive steps being taken to expedite the process or adjust my responsibilities. I am a very senior individual and this was a very hard situation to be in given I had left a high-caliber organization to take on this opportunity. I chalk this up to a broken recruiting process that fails to properly assess a candidates strengths particularly if they come from an industry outside of tech and implicit interviewer bias. Talent management is also quite inflexible.

They thinly veiled this fact with a pre-emptive \"Things change constantly so what happened yesterday may not happen tomorrow\" So what you ended up with was a few cliches that each had their own idea about what day to day was going to look like. I have never worked anywhere where an employee in a position above me complained about another employee as annoying or refer to another group as less than tolerable like at Uber ATG. It was Lord of the Flies meets Animal House. As a social experiment the job was a microcosm of the fall of the western civilization. So I have mixed feelings about it, I really - really - really wish upper management would have seen this, stepped in and given the crew direction. With a little focus things could have been amazing, instead the office in Tempe self-destructed within a year. \r\n\r\nIt was NOT a place where you wanted to tell your team lead that you just had a unsafe interaction with other vehicles in public. I know because I made the mistake of trying to always inform the lead if anything questionable happened. My mistake! A slight infraction would turn into an eminent disaster and a case for execution would be made. Of course not everybody was subject to the same rules. Some of the things other people were doing were careless for the sake of being careless yet as far as I know that was not something of concern. It is not surprising what happened in 2018 happened. Safety was more a tool to keep employees in line rather than an ethic. The similarity between work at Uber ATG Tempe and Lord of the Flies is uncanny.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have seen and what I hear, things in Pittsburgh are awesome, the Tempe issues were not relevant. Which, for me, means that working in Pitt would be a dream job! And I highly suggest it, Tempe is gone so this review is just me venting.

Good luck getting time to yourself, especially if you work as a lower level team member in account management. \"Uber Holidays\" do not apply to Uber Freight, and you will often hear \"freight never sleeps\" as an excuse. If you are salaried, you will not be paid overtime and are typically expected to work on holidays. If you are hourly, you will have to fight with your other coworkers and hope that your manager will let you have the day off.\n-Toxic work environment: did you hear someone saying something inappropriate on the floor and you want to report it to HR? Are they an L3+ employee? If so, your complaints will go unheard. Management has been reported to HR for everything from sexual harassment to racist remarks to asking other employees for drugs on the floor and get a slap on the wrist. Lower level employees have been fired on the spot for an off-color joke. Are you someone that isn't a straight, cisgender white man? Enjoy staying in a lower level position with pay that is much lower than your straight white male counterparts! \n-Young employees: Expect to have someone recruited straight out of college to be your manager, even when there were plenty of people more qualified and with seniority in the office or on your team already. Oh, and expect to train your new manager and continue coaching them throughout your time below them.\nConstant restructures: Don't get too comfortable, your team is always changing! You may get one account, you may have close to 20 accounts, and those accounts may constantly be changing due to frequent reorgs and restructures. \nUseless management: Do you love being micromanaged by someone who does absolutely nothing and/or isn't at all qualified to be your manager? Then this job is for you! Expect to have a new manager on a rotating basis. In the 2+ years I was at UF, I had 6 managers. Only two of them fit the bill for a \"good manager\".\nWhite out culture: Uber loves to boast about how inclusive they are, but the reality is that most employees of color are in low level positions when white men are in charge. Yes, there are ERGs like Pride, Black at Uber, etc - but don't let that fool you. As mentioned above, if you are not a white straight man, you will not be paid or treated as well as your white male counterparts.\nSlackers, slackers, slackers: Expect to pull your weight, plus the weight of countless others who can slide by doing less than the bare minimum. Expect to be drained, exhausted, and overwhelmed while your coworker hangs out and shoots pool with someone from sales and marks it off as an \"important meeting\" on the calendar.\nHigh school all over again: If you loved high school drama, maybe UF is the place for you.
