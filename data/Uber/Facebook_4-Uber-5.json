I've never worked with more intelligent and driven people.\r\n- Compensation, perks, and benefits were very competitive with companies of similar size.\r\n- The technology stack has matured considerably after some initial growing pains. Engineers can provision infrastructure and build/deploy services without excessive red tape.\r\n- Surprisingly strong, positive cultural values. They are really woven into every day work\u2013used as hashtags, referenced by leadership, etc. Most other companies just create a list of cultural values and forget them.", "cons": "- Uber has a bad reputation and is constantly the subject of controversy, protests, and negative press. While Uber is not perfect, I do believe the company has matured since its early years and leadership does take these matters seriously from what I've seen. If you can't handle seeing a negative headline about your employer, Uber may not be for you, but for those that can handle it and want to make a positive impact on our culture and reputation, this shouldn't be an issue.\r\n- Teams and people can shift around frequently as the company continues to grow. This is probably a good thing overall for the company but it can feel jarring at times.\r\n- People work hard\u2013not necessarily because of deadlines but because many of their coworkers are smart, driven, and hard-working people so the bar is set high (that's my experience at least). This is ultimately what you make of it\u2013many people stay late but many people also get into work past 10:00am.
