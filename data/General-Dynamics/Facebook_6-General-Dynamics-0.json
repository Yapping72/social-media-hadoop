And if you inform them you\u2019re already performing the greatest number of tasks you can possibly do, they just say you need to work more overtime to keep up or they\u2019ll force you to work up to 60 hrs by making it mandatory.

Other duties added that wasn't in the original job listing was the requirement to also plan and coordinate the purchasing, kitting, and building of production jobs, managing the FG inventory and performing all inventory transactions in their inventory program that is little more than an accounting program with a limited inventory module included. I was also responsible for verifying that all inventory transactions had been performed prior to accounting closing the job charge numbers, turning in purchase requisitions in to purchasing for all common stock used on the manufacturing floor, inventory and WIP cycle counting and many other duties not listed on the original job description other than what would fall under the \u201cother duties as assigned\u201d category.\r\nHR and management throughout the company gives supervisors a free pass to treat their employees as badly as they would like.
