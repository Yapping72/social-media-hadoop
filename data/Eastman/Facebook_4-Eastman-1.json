Lately there has been a push to emphasize certain HR policies in such a way that there is increasing division across a very large part of the workforce. It is getting increasingly difficult to specially recognize top talent which causes those folks to be disappointed. The obvious focus is a sustained short term strategy to get the stock price up which is something most people definitely desire. In years past, we have attracted lots of professional talent from higher paying jobs in part because they wanted out of a culture that Eastman is now trending towards. One effect is to make it much easier for someone to leave Eastman and go to another employer, since we are losing the culture advantage. A watch out - looking through some other reviews and based on my experience I think that there are quite a few fakes.

Investors can't tell either which is why our stock price has been all over the place since we began our journey to be a \"specialty\" chemical company.

If we do not cut cost then we will be bought out.  Same story year over year.  Many of those initiatives end with positions being cut.  Now that we've cut most of what we can at current facilities, we're outsourcing what is left to India.  \n\nThe performance management system implemented over the past few years is a forced ranking system.

You can meet or even exceed your goals but at the end of the day you will have no idea what to expect until you are told what bucket you made it into.  On top of that you are judged not just by what you accomplish but also on a buzz-word list of behaviors.  It is no wonder so many people have left the professional ranks over the past 2 years.  It is more important that you fit the Eastman mold than actually contribute to the bottom line.\n\nAt a site level there is continual communication on focusing on what is truly a priority.  What is missing and has been for some time is what the priorities truly are.  This has created an environment of frustration and boredom.  People end up working on what they think is important or nothing at all.  We are consistently told to push back on management and coach up when we believe something isn't right or that we are going in the wrong direction.  Do so at your own peril.

I empathize their worries about future and would like to exclude them from my criticisms here. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the \"Local\" elites rule this company and toxicate the culture by placing unskilled and/or spineless people in the middle management. Generally, there is not any clear metric for a manager's performance anyways. There are project leaders or directors who have no clue about their portfolio and/or skills they manage. At EMN, you may keep asking yourself, why is this guy here? and What does s/he really do? Before I left EMN, I started to speculate that these people must have simple missions like KGB/FBI agents who profile and collect information about the others. Unfortunately, I failed to find any other rationale..\r\nIf you join the club and \"liked\" by the right people, you can survive with  simple responsibilities given to you such as being a meeting facilitator.

This is a tiny example of how the passive aggressive culture is justified among people. Honesty and Sincerity are usually blacklisted and not found welcome (or normal). Unnecessary questions and vague criticisms are, on the other hand,  always welcome.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to operate productively in this culture, as  you cannot catalyst any innovation with a positive attitude. You will be labeled as an optimist or a radical. \r\n\r\nI  have not even mentioned the situation of skilled immigrant labor, who are generally sidelined and given little to no responsibility until resolving the residency situation. I also heard that some people make fun of them in the \"club\"  gatherings.\r\n\r\nAgain, for the good of Local and Honest workers and the region, this company should be purchased by a Bigger Peer and get trimmed from the top by the new parent.

Many managers are more interested in advancing their careers than growing the individuals under them.  This leads to them kissing up to their management chain, while those under them are doing the hard work and not getting recognized.  Employees' true feelings and different perspectives are not encouraged; the executive leadership team and many of the managers only want to hear ideas from those that think just like them, or say what they want to hear.  \r\n\r\nManagers also rotate out of their positions on average about every 3 years, which means they can't coach their employees to be more successful because they don't have enough time to get to know them.  Many managers seem to treat women with less respect than men.  Women are afraid to announce pregnancies for fear of being penalized for it.  Some women have been accused of doing lower quality work because they have children.  Eastman has too many layers of management.  This leads to employees spending more time explaining/justifying what they do, rather than doing \u201creal\u201d work.  It also encourages micromanaging and not trusting employees to do the jobs they were hired to do.  \r\n\r\nMorale is at an all time low.  Two layoffs occurred in 2016.  In the second round, good talent was purged.  The stability that was once found at Eastman is gone.  Employees are at risk of being let go, regardless of their ability to perform.  Forcing employees to fit on a distribution curve (meaning someone has to be on the bottom) for pay raises and promotions is also decreasing the morale which is demotivating employees, especially since there are not good checks and balances to ensure that managers are ranking employees on actual performance rather than just the manager's perception of the performance."}], [{"review_title": "Eastman is a great place to work in IT.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "21 Oct 2013", "job_title": "Systems Analyst in Kingsport, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great management.
