Instead, if you are on the forgotten track, you will find yourself pulling 40 or 41 and struggling to get the nod for Director.  \r\n\r\nInexperience in software is shown by the fact that most of PayPal's management comes from financial services companies like Visa, Amex, and Wells Fargo.\r\n\r\nThe combination of these 2 forms of inexperience drives a highly political culture of territorialism, control, and passive aggression.  Products are built and engineers are hired simply to boost the perceived span of control of a particular VP, frequently resulting in VPs being promoted to SVP or even CEO.  You can smell the peanut butter dripping from the products.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the company's success is rarely celebrated, if you are a champion of the customer, you'll be in the world of hurt very quickly, because none of the execs will back you.  That said, almost by Darwinian evolution, most of the staff has adapted and evolved into getting their jobs done and satisfying the end customer by ignoring and not being adversely affected by the management."}, {"review_title": "PayPal review from a former employee", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "27 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Risk Compliance Agent in Chandler, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "benefits were great. most of the people were great to work with.", "cons": "the compensation was not as good as it should be for the type of work done.

During Kids at Work Day, a company-wide event, a manager told employees that they had to stay at their desks even workload is permitted.\r\n     4. Sr. Leaders have been known to procrastinate and take a long time to make decisions.  There have been several instances where their indecisiveness led to urgent \"fire drills\".  They waver about how things should be done and as a result, project deadlines are compromised.  When mistakes are made, they don't want to be held responsible or accountable for them, so the \"finger-pointing\" starts. Others are blamed for the mistakes they should \"own\".  Furthermore, this indecisiveness and procrastination has caused a late reporting which increase regulatory risk for the company. \r\n      5. We recently received an email communication regarding annual performance and 360 Performance Feedback as part of our review.  However, our Sr. Leader mentioned that she will NOT incorporate it into our annual performance review, a blatant disregard for employees feedback/input.  Sr. Leaders say that they welcome our input, but they are not honest with us.  When we offer suggestions, it is not what they want to hear.

Their quality system for the compliance department will cause you to probably lose your job, its highly inconsistent. Just a warning to be careful!!! As a result of that they have lost a lot of people who have quit in fear of losing their jobs. The inconsistency of the compliance department is very scary. They say to use tour best judgement when writing sar reports then fail you if they dont agree with YOUR own investigation. The slightest error can result in a fail.

It's also far from a meritocracy. It's very hard to move up, and the levels are based more on your age and amount of experience rather than your actual skill. My biggest problem though is the outdated culture. The company is still struggling to adjust to a truly agile system, and a lot of the engineering base is unwilling to move from old technologies. There's a large focus on specialization here with very little emphasis on learning and growing. The company is still reeling from the old organizational structure of all of the engineers being split into QA and development, leaving it with many QA engineers who can barely write code and are unwilling to learn. There are also random company policies like internal code and hiring freezes that keep it from moving forward. The technical infrastructure is quite poor. Internal tools go down literally every day, making it very hard for developers to get work done. The code contribution process is weak overall. Version control isn't properly leveraged, a lot of \"hacks\" are pushed to production, code review isn't adequate a lot of the time; in short, a lot of the people here are frankly lazy and perfectly okay adding to the technical debt. There's also a lot of work that has been outsourced, which is unfortunate because outsourced code is usually completely awful and sometimes you have to stay up late to interface with the engineers overseas. Lastly, PayPal can be VERY political. There are a lot of people who would rather \"play the game\" instead of actually working.

Don't expect a lot of participation from Chennai in senior management.\r\nThe management in Chennai has very little authority when it comes to your career options or survival in the company.  Or perhaps, they have no stakes in the matter (there is no transparency at work).\r\nThere are so many managers within the PayPal organization, that don't represent a great model of management.  \r\neBay behaviours are mere statements and i have not seen them followed in spirit by most managers in my hierarchy.\r\nThere are so many senior folks that travel frequently from San Jose to Chennai.  The motivator for young engineers is onsite travel which gets affected  because of those travels.  \r\nIn PayPal, you decide the appraisal rating and then write the review for an employee based on the rating arrived at.  Really weird.  The funny thing is that the management insists on finishing the reviews from the lower level folks but never get it done for themselves.  Not a nice model when it is not practised at every level.\r\nSome managers in San Jose just don't have the maturity to deal with people under them.  They are just not experienced to be global managers.  There have been a variety of contextual situations in support of this.\r\nIf you work in Chennai, expect to be given instructions from San Jose on what needs to be done."}, {"review_title": "A good company with high potential, however org is complex with overlaps, lots of stress and ambiguity", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 May 2013", "job_title": "Vertriebsmanager / Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "competitive pay. stocks are doing good (can be better). smart people to work with. good culture of innovation", "cons": "reorg is norm. collaboration is a joke here when you have to work with several teams who may be doing something similar and everyone try to find their sponsors. work life balance is bad - working on night and weekend is norm here (you may be able to find teams where you don't need to, but usually such teams won't stay long in such fast pace company)."}, {"review_title": "Defining the FinTech industry", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "29 May 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing opportunities to grow and challenge yourself.

Its efforts to become an online mall with merchandise sold at slight discounts and fixed prices don't seem to me to give it a distinctive edge in the market, particularly in comparison with the premier mall, Amazon.com.  A significant number of business columnists openly wonder what eBay's compelling value proposition will be, given the company's trajectory.  In fact, in a recent effort to make eBay a safer place to shop, it is likely to run afoul of anti-trust laws in Australia.\r\n\r\nThus far, in my business unit, PayPal doesn't believe in creating thorough business requirements, and it doesn't have dedicated requirements analysts, which means that quality isn't designed into the products it produces or the business development processes.  As a result, the company alternates between cycles of putting out new products and fixing them. \r\n\r\nEfforts to modernize the company's technology infrastructure are taking a long time.  As a result, many innovative and creative projects can't be undertaken. For instance, the new, semi-annual \"lab rats\"/skunkworks competition shows off the creativity of staff, but even winning projects are not usually turned into development projects because of techological constraints (or higher-level corporate priorities).  Turnover is high, as many talented people leave to improve their professional skills at more technically modern companies.  Average tenure is 2-3 years.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, Sr. mgt. didn't have experience in running a big company, and they still make decisions without realizing the downstream ramifications and without communication channels to get the feedback to know those effects quickly.  The new sr. staff brought in to grow the company in certain areas (marketing, creative, sales) seem to be authoritarian and hierarchical in their management style.\r\n\r\nWhile work-life balance is generally respected, I have seen some software development groups work 10+ hours/day, 6-7 days a week for a month to meet deadlines, and management has not stepped in to re-evaluate schedules.  In addition, there is a curious reluctance to establish a campus near San Francisco, where a large number of employees live.

You may be a great engineer - but if you cannot carve out authority on a PayPal Product then you are going to face an uphill climb.  The problem for the company is that the people with the technical excellence may tend to tread water ( and leave ) while the mediocre engineers who invest less time in being better engineers and more time into learning more about how a PayPal product works are the ones who move up in rank.  Many engineers do things just because they saw someone else do it the same way in a previous project while never really bothering to understand why.  As you ask around you soon discover that most people have no idea why things work the way they do - \"just because\".\r\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, I feel this is why the company is merely \"very good\" versus \"great\" but it seems to work ( at least for now ) as far as the company is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe place is meeting-happy.  Meetings to prepare for meetings.  And then meetings to discuss meetings.  It is next to impossible to jump into a room and brainstorm on the board for 10 minutes because all of the rooms are constantly occupied by folks sitting around in the dark staring at laptops.  This is a middle management problem.  Upper management is well aware of the issue and does try to curtail the silliness but it has proven to be a tough habit to break.  We just love to sit in circle formation with our laptops whipped out and collectively catch up on email while a speaker presents something.\r\n\r\nLots and lots and lots of internal tools that just plain suck (sorry, but we all know it).  Management is aware and has pushed a lot to improve things and it has gotten better but we still have a way to go.\r\n\r\nThe Software Developers are expected to do everything.  From filing a dozen tickets to managing projects to scheduling meetings to writing software to monitoring software once it is live - you can bet your bottom Dollar that a Developer somewhere is doing the heavy lifting.

They say management looks at it, but I have never know them to. If you work extra hard, it only yields a pat on the back. They are more strict on dress code in Chandler than they are in Omaha, which doesn't make much sense given Omaha is the corp. headquarters.

Don't be fooled by the Phoenix Business Journal's 2014 \"Best Places to Work\" survey, either.  Management set aside time for employees to take the survey and coaxed employees into giving positive responses to the survey.

But cost of living here is pretty brutal, so those of you scoping this place out for a possible move would be well advised to look into how expensive this area is.", "cons": "-Being owned (anchored) by eBay\r\n-Being a financial institution and not a software company in how we are run (Scott Thompson is a former Visa guy, so he's pretty much destroyed the silicon valley vibe the company had and driven off the more creative and brilliant rank and file developers.)\r\n-Our customers generally resent our draconian policies and fees (read articles with comment sections, anything related to PayPal or eBay - PayPal's parent, and you will see how much venom people spew at us... and if they weren't so right, I think it wouldn't weigh so heavily on my sense of job satisfaction.)\r\n-Salary freeze (even though we at PayPal delivered double digit growth, being part of eBay meant the company as a whole didn't do well, so we all get punished)\r\n-Getting eBay options (we recently fell into the single digits, while Amazon, eBay's closest competitor has been soaring up into the 70's \u2013 nullifying the excuses our executives keep blabbing about the economy being the cause \u2013 when everyone in, and out, of the company knows it's the direct result of our incompetent management.)\r\n-Having a board of directors that doesn't fire the head of eBay (read the eBay reviews to see how much he's reviled by our co-workers over on the eBay side of the company.)\r\n-With billions in the bank we had a layoff which was totally unnecessary, yet just because other companies are doing it, the clown-show-exec-staff decided to shrink the teams... then go on a shopping spree to buy Paylater for more than a billion. This is what I hate, times are tough and they figure they can do anything they want and people aren't in a position to quit...  Well, sadly they might be able to do so now, but they're paying a high cost in terms of morale, and retaining the best of the best (who can find work in any economy.)\r\n-Having process' and procedures piled on all the time.  Doing ANYTHING is an oversize in frustration at PayPal.\r\n-The corporate Network is slow... really slow (we're a high tech company!?  really????)\r\n-Most of our tools are sub-par, and sluggish\r\n-Getting any suggestions to percolate up through the lower management filter to higher levels is impossible\r\n-Bonus' (back when we actually had them) were tied to shared goals... that are NEVER fully met.  Many of my co-workers look at the most prominent of the goals, which is known as A.T.B. (average time to business) as a simple scam to limit bonus payouts.  Nice to know that we grunts, who work like crazy get chiseled out of our bonus' by the multi-million dollar bonus earning clowns up top.\r\n-Metrics collection and \"meeting the numbers\" frequently will interfere with getting the real work done\r\n-There's ever increasing demands that we do more, in less time...  unless you brown nose your way into a cozy relationship with your boss, you get no concessions for the extra time and efforts.\r\n-To summarize, PayPal is a very frustrating place to work.  I've decided I'll hold this job a while longer (while the economy is so crazy), but as soon as things calm some, I'm going to fire this company and find a place that isn't so infested with incompetent management, and which isn't so completely obsessed with keeping everyone burried in process' and pointless side tasks."}, {"review_title": "Great culture, terrible process", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Oct 2009", "job_title": "Senior Web Developer in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management cares about the people under them and the company cares about the people it hires.
