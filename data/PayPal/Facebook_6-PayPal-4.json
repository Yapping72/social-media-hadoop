Sounds good, but it is apparently to be ignoring by everyone from team lead and up. Discriminating people for having a disability by giving them a hard time when they are off sick with the flu is not doing the right thing. People with disabilities can get the flu just like any other person. And sending them to a disciplinary hearing (yes that's what they call it) with the message that it's because of concerns about the other health issues and that this might cause extra sick days in the future is certainly not the right thing. Especially not if said person simply had the flu and did not take a single minute off regarding this disability. Furthermore, later on denying that this comment wasn't made is not being honest and punishment through false accusations and a bad performance review for being open and direct about seeking legal advice is unacceptable. None of the values have been followed in this case. \r\nOther than that it is ridiculous to expect grown ups to constantly show off how well the are at their job by making them boast about in the meetings and thro laughable competitions. We are adults, not children who need a sticker from the teacher. Just leave us alone so we can do the actual job. Some of talk about doing their job more than actually doing it, and are rewarded for it with condescending praise. Yes, great value that. Oh by the way, winning these competitions will result in little more than a pat on the back. Not really worth spending your time on, especially if you are being hounded to reach a high amount of productivity. Also, stop trying to dictate what people do in their free time by openly frowning upon them not spending it on work related activities and nights out that aren't even team related and that we have to pay for ourselves. This is \"stimulated\" in a very pushy manner. Some people have a life outside of work. It's supposed to be a company, not a cult, and nobody can join in every single time.

They do not keep their word on anything or practice what they preach. We were told we were in one department in training. And when we hit the floor we were basically all departments and were held accountable. PayPal is basically a Hardcore Call center expect to take 80 to 100 calls easily no filter for departments. They will let some people go for doing the same thing someone else is doing. But if they don\u2019t like you you\u2019re the one that\u2019s let go or written up.  I knew people that were well over the attendance threshold but were still working. While others were terminated on the spot because of their attendance.  I had always wanted to work for this company in there Fraud Department or Compliance Department (Which are now nonexistent). They do have a lot of layoffs so you never know if you have a job or not.  I believe at some point this company was great. But in the last year so many Great people left during the time I was there while the hardcore social climbers stayed. If you want to work for a company that pays very little and works you until your mental capacity is about to break this is the company for you. Employees will try to sabotage you because they think that's how they can get ahead. I was lied to over and over the entire time I was there nothing was consistent.  But it\u2019s done that way to brainwash you into working harder and believing that they really care when they don't.  The workload is unbearable and they do not care until they are fined or losing money. They micromanage you without doing it aggressively by 7 meetings a week. There's one team meeting per week, 5 short meetings then a one on one with your manager every week to keep up with you. I would have rather had an hour lunch incorporated every day or an extra mental break. They\u2019re very unprofessional but that's so that you will let your guard down to instill trust them. If you are an adult and want to feel like you are trusted and given benefit of the doubt and like to work independently do not work here.  Not to mention an electronic key to log into your computer that's how much they trust you.  They have laid off two departments that were really great departments (All Back office Positions). But claiming there is still opportunity in the company. The pay is definitely under what they expect from you. We were told we would be in one department doing one job function. On a day to day bases we were taking calls from other subsidiaries , also Site support calls , email calls , dispute calls , fraud calls and collections calls (without getting paid for collections). If you like really intense and very busy hyper environments this is for you. Management walking around all day constant meetings right there on the floor. Management also standing around talking to one another about other employees. I honesty felt really uncomfortable and I had reason to feel so. They let go of all the genuine management and kept the ones that were willing to be corrupted in fear of losing their jobs. And forget about sick time with this company you will be lucky to have PTO for 5 or 6 days. Not much work balance in my opinion unless you want to take it without a check.\r\n\r\n There is always someone on the floor  watching. The walls are glass so there is always someone looking.  Wages are roughly about $15 an hour but there expecting $ 18 worth of work. You are not fired for your stats but you are reminded of them every day aggressively. And the way they are set up you look really bad unless you are in a very low percentage. And wage increases are very minimal not huge in any way. I suggest seriously if you are not willing to give your soul and integrity to this company think twice.  I have talked to people that had mental breakdowns and were let go.  The final act was just jaw dropping all lies no truth what so ever which in any other state they couldn\u2019t have gotten by with lying. If you go into this company trust no one always know that you are judged every second. Everyone is scared when people are fired you ask what happen to this person. I don't know there just not here anymore?  No one should live in fear like that. The stats are basically a monthly report (but its weekly) they have everything on their except for your bathroom breaks but they are monitored separately and definitely a big deal.  They send your stats out to everyone that's so you can feel bad if you\u2019re behind and work harder. Nothing is private it\u2019s all designed to make you work harder for nothing. Stat wise you have 6 other things to meet including a Re-contact rate and a Transfer rate. Yes! You are held accountable if the customer calls back as well as if you have to transfer them to another segment. Plus you couldn\u2019t really assist the client in most cases because PP systems had already implemented the decision (Which I heard that's why the compliance dept. was not needed. So in all essence you were there to take the heat and couldn\u2019t give an answer. But at the same time you were given the negative survey for this which heavily weighed if you made bonus or not? It really was stressful and didn't make a lot of sense. If you are looking for stability I wouldn't bank on this job. If you are an adult and looking for a real job skip this place they cater to mostly the younger population now. To mold them into how they expect PayPal Soldiers to be and to be grateful for working for the company. Bonuses are a joke they are quarterly and very little money. Management do not work at all just schedule one on ones all day and  go to meetings what I said above. And it really makes the environment uncomfortable because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next. Which in most cases there is always something but nothing that\u2019s going to advance the employee\u2019s paycheck. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this company to anyone. They do not pay enough for the quality of work and expectations that they want from their employees.  And the micromanagement is stressful and overbearingly scripted. The company feels more like a cult than an actual place to work which made me uncomfortable especially for the money. You will have scripts to read and will sound like a android daily. This company\u2019s reputation is surviving off the people who had integrity that are now leaving either by choice of force. As time goes on you will see that the reviews will rapidly decline. All that remains are the people with no heart no conscious and just trying to survive to keep their job."}, {"review_title": "Definitely one of the best companies to work with.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Feb 2020", "job_title": "Team Leader in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary, benefits like stocks for all, totally employee centric", "cons": "They have standard operating policies across the globe like fixed shifts and week off which does not work well as per IST shift timings.

Please do not expect them to help you or even take you seriously. They are there to protect the most senior of leaders. That's it. They are the next most dysfunctional attendee to this party. The HR senior leader refuses to engage on escalated issues therefore rendering complete paralysis to the team managers. Issues go for months and months without response or action and when things hit critical mass, the individuals escalating beyond for any type of intervention and support get the boot. And do not think to escalate to any senior execs either. Your issue will get pushed back down to the person you've raised concerns about and you will be at the mercy of their wrath....which, of course, is to get the boot and keep their reputation tidy.\r\n\r\nIn short, to anyone doing their due diligence right now (be glad you did) please do your homework before you leave another environment to come here or even look to start your career here. Ask around your network, get the scoop not from the recruiter trying to sell you on utopia...but the real deal.  If you aspire to receive recognition, support, career growth and a healthy environment- this isn't it. You likely won't be developed (the leaders who are supposed to be developing you aren't even developed). You probably won't see the benefit of promotion from within (but your leader's BFF might!). You may not even be supported by your leader, or your leader's leader and definitely not your leaders' leader's leader or beyond. There are better places to cut your teeth on than here. You can do better."}], [{"review_title": "Telesales.

Your issue will get pushed back down to the person you've raised concerns about and you will be at the mercy of their wrath....which, of course, is to get the boot and keep their reputation tidy.\r\n\r\nIn short, to anyone doing their due diligence right now (be glad you did) please do your homework before you leave another environment to come here or even look to start your career here. Ask around your network, get the scoop not from the recruiter trying to sell you on utopia...but the real deal.  If you aspire to receive recognition, support, career growth and a healthy environment- this isn't it. You likely won't be developed (the leaders who are supposed to be developing you aren't even developed). You probably won't see the benefit of promotion from within (but your leader's BFF might!). You may not even be supported by your leader, or your leader's leader and definitely not your leaders' leader's leader or beyond. There are better places to cut your teeth on than here. You can do better."}, {"review_title": "Great work/life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance is important here.

Following the survey, there are a large number of terminations. The company is not growing in physical size/Employee capacity but yet are constantly hiring. It's common practice for both Team Leaders and Group Leaders to have favorites and hold grudges. Management is always saying they're looking for motivated people and for people to take charge of projects. The reality of this situation is that they put these motivated people into Supervisor internships with a promise of a permanent spot only put them back on the floor in their previous position with no compensation for any bonuses or incentives missed. Those people who are motivated enough to start projects to help their co-workers perform their jobs better are then despised by the Team Leaders because those employee's are doing the Team Leader's jobs. They say they want to make it easy for employees to get to the positions they want to be in and to move up in the company. The reality is that they have made the process so entirely convoluted and difficult that the people with the knowledge and skills for those positions are overlooked for an unqualified candidate.\r\n\r\nA couple of years back, PayPal wasn't such a cut throat company to work for, management seemed to have a genuine care for their employees happiness and advancement within the company. Since the split from eBay was announced things took a turn for the worse, management no longer communicated important decisions to the employees, team leaders were turned against their teams and became puppets to corporate. If they voiced their opinion about corporate's decisions they were put on warning or terminated. This trickled down to every employee and created a very tense workplace with everyone fearing for their job. It was no longer enjoyable to show up to work and instead became very stressful. Seeing entire teams and droves of people get terminated after the \"Best Places to Work\" survey was taken doesn't help with the feeling of dread either. Unfortunately this company is managing themselves into the ground and refuse to see that for themselves.

Your computer screens are recorded from the moment you login to the moment you logoff.

You pick 5 jobs you'd like and whenever a position opens up, they look at everyone who has that job in their #1 spot and whoever has the current highest stats will get picked without an interview.

She then looked at the timestamp of his badge swipe at the front doors and saw it was a few minutes after the time he told her. So she fired him for trying to scam the company out of a few minutes of paid time. I was fired because I sent an email, stats for our team, while clocked into a \"productive task\".

This may be true for the non-call center position, but it's definitely fool's gold at the call centers. It's all about who you know rather than how well you do your job. If you're well liked by management, they will essentially get you the schedule and position that you're looking for. If you fall into disfavor, look forward to skipped one-on-one meetings (required weekly coaching meetings that help YOU improve with your manager), low yearly ratings, strict enforcement and harassment, no promotion and/or moving out of the department, write ups, and possibly even termination. I have seen people get fired for absolutely BS reasons. There are rare opportunities to move up, but most people try to move sideways off the phones, which gets you stuck there for 6+ months. \r\n\r\nThere is also a culture of misinformation and deception both to employees and customers. Managers regularly withhold information or straight up lie. For a company that supposedly focuses on being transparent with customers and employees, they fall short. A fun lie is that \"PayPal has never been hacked.\" While it is true that there has not been an attack that has successfully taken large amounts of data (as far as PayPal knows), ALL systems are hackable - it's a matter of how fast you detect, catch, and expel the invader. We also had to regularly lie about \"system undergoing maintenance\" when something would crash or a bug was plaguing the system. While technically true in the sense that engineers/techs would be updating the system to fix these, it implies that the bugs/outages are intentional - which is definitely intentional deception.\r\n\r\nAlso in the 3 years that I worked here, I was always one of the top performers and even received the top rating for each yearly review (Exceeds Most), yet cumulatively I received only 7.5% raises. One of those raises was from getting a slight promotion, that they ended up giving to ALL customer service agents less than 6 months later."}, {"review_title": "Fraud agent limitation", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Customer Solutions Agent in Dundalk", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "the best reason is the benefit , and if you are sick you can have 6 months of sickness paid .\r\nGym and facilities", "cons": "you can't grow at paypal dundalk .

Some would think that call centers are filled with fresh graduates. I want to correct that assumption. PayPal KL is filled with folks who has >5 years working experience, didn't get anywhere, and was somehow brought into the organization, influencing the rest of the staff with bad working culture and attempted political underplay.\r\n3. Staff treatment. My years at PayPal saw a few of the good folks leaving for greener pastures.

He made his team leader aware he wanted to move to a specific role. An opportunity for this role came up and because he missed target the quarter the role was available for he didn\u2019t get the job. The agent who got the job only happened to meet metrics for the first time that quarter bit throughout the year was not reaching target and to make things worse was always out sick.\r\nThis same scenario happened to other agents when shifts were changed. Years of consistent good work mean working, happen to get luck and meet metrics the month a job comes available or a shift change then you will get it over an agent who fails once. VERY UNFAIR and bad for the company overall.\r\n\r\nNow regarding continuous learning:\r\nAn agent had started a college course in computers. Before he started the course he asked work would it be possible for him to do the course and get hours that suit. Work changed his shift to allow him finish on time for college. He then pays his fees up front costing thousands.\r\nWork then change his shift and advise him he cannot have the hours to go college. Even though there were shifts available that other agents got and he made work aware hay he couldn\u2019t work late certain days. He was told to accept it or leave the company. PayPal don\u2019t care about college or your development this is a perfect example. Most big companies will accommodate those who study in the evening especially not change the employees shift during their college year after it was previously approved!!!\r\n\r\nOther points to note:\r\nA common trend looking at these reviews suggest that \u201cfavoritism\u201d based on how friendly you are with the management team is what gets you promoted etc... I can confirm this is completely true. Unfortunately your TL has too much power over your career. They will let friends away with certain things like warnings etc and turn a blind eye this not to negitgely impact career progression whilst they will penalize others who not their friend. \r\n\r\nMy advice:\r\nDon\u2019t join Paypal if you want a career.\r\nIf you do... add your manager on WhatsApp , go for drinks with them and play the game. Also don\u2019t worry if your not consistent with stats you might get lucky"}, {"review_title": "Not an employee Friendly workplace at all", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Feb 2019", "job_title": "Risk Analyst in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and compensation\r\nCab facility\r\nInfrastructure", "cons": "Don't even consider genuine medical conditions and permanent graveyard shifts to female employees.. same was never informed during joining\r\nManagement is biased they give preference to few people over others.\r\nManagement is not good and doesn't care about employee satisfaction at all\r\nOffer any role to anyone regardless of their prior experience or compensation"}, {"review_title": "Intentions are positive towards growth and change, but inertia keeps company doing more of the same", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Sept 2019", "job_title": "Product Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Promoting self-development amongst employees, innovation brainstorms are common and accepted", "cons": "Structure makes it too difficult to actually make true business changes, alignment between product teams is difficult to achieve forcing you to spend weeks upon weeks just securing a commitment to get support for a small thing you need for what you're working on."}, {"review_title": "extremely weak management and subsurvient culture", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Jun 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "the eBay stock is doing well, so people with unvested equity tend to wait for vesting, but the morale seems very low and many people are looking for other jobs", "cons": "extremely week middle management and subserviant culture"}, {"review_title": "Product management", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Jan 2015", "job_title": "Senior Product Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The work is very interesting and it helps you build core competency which is very good for future\r\nPackage is pretty good compared to industry\r\nVery smart and talented people in the company", "cons": "The work life balance tends to get a little off as company is growing rapidly\r\nStill feels a bit disorganized even though company is no longer a start-up"}], [{"review_title": "I worked at PayPal for just over a year and was promoted during the time I was there.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Feb 2015", "job_title": "Debit Card Agent in Chandler, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great training, facilities are amazing, good benefits, they paid well", "cons": "It can be difficult to get a shift that you really want.
