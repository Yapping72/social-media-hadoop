My work/life balance is fine, the pay is fine, and the benefits are fine. It's literally everything else that's awful.\r\n\r\nOnboarding and my team are the two biggest negative experiences. \r\n\r\nI feel like I'm burdening all of my teammates and especially my manager. I repeatedly cannot get the support I need and this has discouraged me from seeking help. The help I do get is a \"oh, you have to use this tool.\" So I get referred to this tool like it's something I should know how to use when, in reality, it is a tool that was built internally at PayPal and I, as a new hire, have a 0% chance of knowing how to use. \r\n\r\nIn general I'm drowning in a pool of abbreviations, foreign terms, and a lack of context. Documentation is scattered in confluence and mostly outdated. Reading source code is a good way to learn, but it's unfortunately the only way to learn at PayPal. When I ask for more help I'm either ignored or I another suggestion made without enough context.\r\n\r\nCommunication in general is poor. My team is mind-blind when it comes to onboarding a new hire. They seem to not understand that I don't yet know how things are done at PayPal and they can't remember how to set up a new developer for success. Finally, there is 0 enthusiasm on my team. Nobody loves what they do and that is tragic. This is also a byproduct of lackluster management. I've tried to cultivate team spirit, but I feel stupid for doing so when it is met with nothing.\r\n\r\nWorking at PayPal feels like eating by myself in a massive food court. I think there are teams out there that are fun and productive, but my team is the opposite. I'm just a newbie floating around waiting to be terminated. PayPal feels like a corporate blob and I have zero personal connections with my team. I feel as if I am burdening them and as well as my manager. I feel bad that I'm not instantaneously up-to-speed. \r\n\r\nFinally, a re-org eliminated a team member out of the blue and it gives me no security as I feel like my team doesn't like me because I'm new and stupid.\r\n\r\nThe business is doing well, but I'd rather have fun on a sinking ship than be unhappy on a yacht."}, {"review_title": "Do plenty of research before you accept a position", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "4 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Compliance Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good pay, good if you know nothing, can fake your way through your job, no one really manages", "cons": "bad for work life balance, must be a yes person, leaders don't want your opinion, bad management/mostly former consultants"}], [{"review_title": "Good company to work rfor if you are new", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Learning and Development Specialist II in Dundalk", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great perks and a good community.

It produced a feeling of unfairness as the departments in question were very, VERY small and quite cohesive prior to the acquisition, even with salary and task differences. Understandable that PayPal had to align the positions to their own departments, but it felt like the local departments just split off and became almost foreign to each other, in a very negative way, not only compensation-wise, but even socially. \r\n- Employees in certain pay grades (not necessarily C-level but just employees in different departments) appeared to be treated quite well, while employees at lower-level pay grades were always given the short-end of the stick (less benefits, minuscule bonuses, etc.), even with years of loyalty and hard work. Never seen such a disparity in treating coworkers at any other company in terms of benefits.\r\n- Competitive culture with what felt like a lot of elitism between certain individuals and teams once the acquisition happened. The acquisition seemed to put a lot of people up on a \u201chigh horse\u201d which was laughable to see. Lots of petty drama too. \r\n- PayPal likes fluffing themselves up on all the good they do and the record profits they make, and though they may do good, they don\u2019t necessarily translate this to their employees in terms of wages and job security. They could do much, much more for their employees, particularly at the lower levels.\r\n- Further on the outsourcing: after acquisition, teams overseas were trained on local work and although job security was reassured, that promise was not held up... you can see where that leads to. Plenty of false promises that your job will be secure which turned out to be a lie. \r\n- Salaries and hourly wages were laughable in some departments compared to similar positions at other companies. It was easy to understand why people left one-by-one after the acquisition.\r\n- Raises were meagre and non-negotiable despite record profits and despite you working yourself to the bone... so there\u2019s really no incentive to work hard as you\u2019ll get compensated in peanuts anyways.\r\n- Higher-ups abroad have an eat-breathe-work attitude, with little to no work-life balance that felt like it was pushed onto lower-level employees at certain points.\r\n- Quantity over quality was key and encouraged... which led to an enormous amount of time wasted fixing stupid mistakes made when rushing the work. \r\n- Little opportunity to move around or up in Vancouver unless you move to the US or overseas. Was a lot different with Hyperwallet where there were opportunities to learn new skills and take on new positions with no prior experience. \r\n- Just another giant tech corporation. Free snacks and t-shirts are nice, but I\u2019d rather skip that and get compensated and treated fairly.\r\n- Dan Schulman seems to have good interests at heart but it feels like it gets severely bumbled somewhere down the corporate ladder."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Customer Identity Advisor in Phoenixville, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work.
