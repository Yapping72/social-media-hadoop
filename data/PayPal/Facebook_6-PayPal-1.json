PayPal keeps growing and has no intention to stop. Its variety in offering payment solutions for the underbanked is truly amazing and limitless.

There were a ton of opportunities to learn about other departments, partner with other teams to tackle problems, and even help our training teams manage their workload. We got to volunteer with our teams once a year, which was lovely. One year, my leader took our team on a paid \u201cteam retreat\u201d where we learned more about diversity and inclusion in a relaxed environment. Our group leader had hundreds of people under her at one point, but was still able to focus on every individual and call out their strengths. Absolutely amazing experience. Until I moved to a support role.", "cons": "Towards the end of my PayPal journey, I spent a year interning in a support role. During this internship, I was basically given busy work by my \u201cmanagers\u201d to keep me quiet, and completely ignored by them otherwise. I hoped that if I stuck around long enough, maybe I would get some actual training. Little did I know, the nightmare had just begun.\n\nI was given the support role, and immediately discovered the pay for this \u201cpromotion to salary pay\u201d was 2000.00 less annually than I had earned the year prior as operational leadership. But my health insurance cost nearly doubled as a result of switching to salary. So I lost money for this \u201camazing\u201d new role.\n\nThen, after a year of no training by leadership while interning, I was suddenly plunged into a hellscape of:\n-still no actual training\n- having huge projects flung at me without warning, usually two- three months later than I should have known about them, causing major issues for the company and my sanity\n- oh by the way, these projects you don\u2019t get notified about until they are three months in? They\u2019re all going to be labeled \u201chigh visibility high priority moonshots\u201d so I better not mess up, right? Ha!\n- Id would be doing that moonshot high visibility top priority project that I have zero training for and require PD support for (and tell my boss this) then my own boss would go and tell PD to prioritize something else completely so it won\u2019t get done on time and then I would get yelled at by my boss even though my boss knowingly sabotaged it for me and still expected me to complete the project according to near impossible timeframes\n-I remember successfully creating a gigantic presentation I was told about last minute and presenting it to upper management to rave reviews- only for my own manager to pull me aside and say I did \u201cfine\u201d but would never succeed as a manager unless I dropped 1500.00 on a Carnegie Mellon public speaking course\n-did I mentioned no training for this role?!\n-I had my senior manager state he wanted to meet with me to discuss a list of issues I had identified and shared on yet another high priority moonshot. He insisted I set up the meeting at a very specific time, and proceeded to simply not show up. I sat in a teams meeting for 30 minutes while he refused to respond to my messages asking him to join. When I rescheduled the meeting later in the week, he showed up hostile and cranky, and when I asked him to please let me know if he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it to a meeting, he yelled at me that he had apologized to one of my peers about that \u201cthe other day\u201d so I needed to get over it. This manager then never spoke to me directly ever again- for a year.\n-the white male management just loves talking about how they\u2019ve recently hired \u201cso many women and are so diverse\u201d- meanwhile this group is less diverse than they have ever been, with all the female senior management leaving, one after the other. More on that\u2026.\n-every Black, Mexican and Asian manager and their teams were abruptly moved to other departments with no warning in one fell swoop towards the end of my time with the company. Whether this was intentional or not, it looked incredibly bad on my department.\n-eleven hour shifts. Probably with no lunch. Get on early enough to meet with someone in the UK(5am) stay on late enough to meet with someone in Australia (5pm) and probably have to do some extra work with India (10pm) from your phone while laying in bed. It never stops. And while all this is happening, your managers are going on vacations back to back. It\u2019s a nightmare!\n-being gaslit by management. They refuse to respond to requests for help, then find a way to blame you if things don\u2019t go as they should. These people should not manage the department they do as they have no certifications or degrees of any kind and no knowledge on the subject. They BS their way through work and throw the \u201chard\u201d stuff onto new hires and other support positions. \n- Finally, I ended up having to go on leave due to major depression prior to leaving the company. Two months in, my leave was approved with less than a week of leave time left, and I got the correspondence via email. Then, I put in a resignation three days later, and the leave was suddenly denied via paper letter because I \u201cdressed appropriately\u201d to go to my doctor and therefore couldn\u2019t have been ill. Seems awfully retaliatory and illegal to me, but whatever. :) ok PayPal \n\nAnyway, long story short. PayPal was a wonderful place to be for nearly eight years.

We are not allowed to hang up on abusive customers but only report them after the call. You can literally have every number great but if your handle time is bad you will get fired. They do not care if you have the best knowledge of any customer service agent in your team or how happy you keep customers, if your handle time is high you will get fired.\n\nThey will also blame you for technical issue with the equipment provided to you. If the laptop given to you is so slow that your calls keep dropping or it add to your handle time with a customer, guess what? It is your fault. When you contact IT to solve any issues, it never gets solved but because of this you are not able to work, guess what?

PayPal no longer cares about their employee or truly assisting customer, I no longer even use PayPal for my own business.
