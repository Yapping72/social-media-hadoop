This skill, developed continuously over time, will serve one well in the more advanced stages of their career.

With a workforce of over 700K, and the UK workforce surpassing 10,000, one's career experience might vary depending on the project, peers, and reporting structure. Most of the negative reviews centre around a person's dissatisfaction with the promotion process, and the work involved to ensure the strongest possibility of getting promoted; this ranges from project feedback, representation in the appraisal process, and visibility. Balancing this many factors is a formidable challenge. Changes in a large organisation culture, or operating model take time - even if the benefits of change have been apparent for a while, convincing a sufficiently large critical mass of the leadership team is going to require one of two things: the decision is comes from a much higher authority, or the problem grows to an extent where its at the magnitude of a crisis, and cannot be ignored any longer.
