Some competitors pay the same entry level position twice as much.\r\n- Except for holidays package, benefits aren\u2019t great and those that are available are often \u201chidden\u201d, as if the company didn\u2019t really want employees to find out about them\r\n- Workflow is very irregular and in general there is poor resource management and planning, so you might end up doing nothing for days and then having to work late for multiple weeks. This is especially true at the beginning, where a lot of new joiners spend weeks waiting to be assigned to a project and just wasting precious time. \r\n- There is also a lot of pressure to do \u201cside desk\u201d work alongside your required project work. This type of work is often just useless and takes time and energy away from you but without it your chances to get promoted are halved. \r\n- Travel to client site (although rare nowadays) can be very stressful, and depending on where you live in London, you might have to travel 2h to client and back everyday. (I had to do that pre-pandemic for 4 months and it was the most miserable experience)\r\n- It\u2019s a very big corpo environment and it really feels like it. You constantly feel like a number and it\u2019s hard to find a project where you can actually see the impact of your work.

Now, as the cost of living has gone up, so too has the salaries and consequently the jobs are beginning to leave again to the next delivery centre location.
