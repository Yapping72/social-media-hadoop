I had a 55 hour week minimum between my core 40 hours for my client, 5 hours on admin related work because Accenture expects ridiculously planning on your career despite everything being up in the air (including when your next 3 month contract will be). I also had 10 hours per week of management training- which really translated to B2B sales, not growing people or helping them become better. Show up perfect or be devoured by colleagues. Very competitive atmosphere, no work life balance. You work with people from other countries on projects, which is good except they have no context for the industry (like American healthcare) and you end up either handing over a poor product or staying up late to redo the work because the analysts and interns didn't understand the assignment.
