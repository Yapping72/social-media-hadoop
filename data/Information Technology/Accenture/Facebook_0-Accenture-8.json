Dirty office, a pc that doesnt work, afwul people working there with zero skills. \n\nIts a place where people just stay to earn some money\n\nDid I mention they blame you for everything? \n\nLiterally the most disgusting place I have worked and they award you with some nice videos of ISIS beheadings. \n\nJust to wrap it up, the TLs are bragging about having had 20+ leave notices, cause that means they'll get promoted quicker ;) Thats the level they are on. \n\nSummer 2 weeks maximum off. This office and leadership prays on vulnerable people with almost no experience so that can be manipulated and exploited. \n\nJust stay away from accenture. \n\nOh and my phone got nikked too, in the office.

Contestability period is when you cannot use the 100% coverage until you have satisfied the contestability period. Also, the HMO contribution for dependents is not 100% shouldered by company. It's subsidized only. Other companies in the Philippines (as big as them) cover 100% of contribution without contestability period.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Unskilled People Managers/Leads - In big organizations like this, you often encounter good and poor people management skills. But I have reason to believe there are many of the poorly-skilled ones than the good ones here. The people managers/lead don't really undertake behavior qualifications nor pass certain workshops on how to be a people manager. They are promoted based on tasks achievements or when the business have grown, but they lack experience & knowledge in proper people handling. There is just too many error.. some you can use as ground for labor complaint in DOLE. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. Accenture is a PEZA company so they are required to use the PEZE locations, if not they will pay.. so they require their employees to sit in the office 1x-2x per week in the office.\r\n\r\n4. Not as multi-cultural as I expected - There is only Filipino and Indian culture. So imagine that combination, e.g. blind appeal to authority, men underestimating women, culture of saving face, etc. There are many politics-savvy in this company and the leaders thrive here, haha!\r\n\r\n5. Careful in recruitment! - Recruitment they low ball every candidate. They would even offer you lower salary than your current. They did that to my referral. The remedy here is tell the hiring manager during their interview how much you want. Also it's a 10-hour work day here and the dependent HMO contestability period are the items they will not tell you until you sign the contract."}, {"review_title": "Feels like working as labourers", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Senior Associate in Gurgaon, Haryana", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Accenture will provide you good salary in comparison to other companies.", "cons": "They will take your blood your life for work if they are paying you good.

Accenture push everyone towards their free learning library, even though it SUCKS. There is no opportunity to get paid training, even if you are an experienced hire and it makes sense for your department to invest in specialised talent, that would both benefit the client and other consultants.\n\n- Culture at Accenture is ZERO. Their idea of culture is to host as many meetings as possible to force more information to you (service offerings, capability building), even when COVID/Zoom burnout is real.\nLeadership at Accenture are delusional, thinking Microsoft Team message threads are a way to build team culture.\nAccenture hold onto every single dollar, not willing to invest in small team building, or larger team gatherings.
