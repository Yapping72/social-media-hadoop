For a variety of reasons (and covid was a huge catalyst), general morale and work ethic seemed to decline greatly over the past few years. It became increasingly difficult to get anything meaningful accomplished in day-to-day work. The products themselves became increasingly bloated and buggy, plus the overall business strategy became muddled (specifically the cloud strategy). VMware recognized the need to transform from a \"product\" company towards a \"services\" company but simply lacked the ability to successfully transition. Major transformations require agility and ability to adapt products quickly, which is simply not possible for companies that have allowed themselves to become complacent."}, {"review_title": "Best tech company to work for hands down", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Sr. Mgr.

The senior management does not give any insight, clarity of direction to employees including the most senior employees. News of acquisition comes as a surprise to all employees including the ones working at SVP, VP or Director level. Ever since the company went public in November 2021, it was announced by the CEO that VMware will operate independently now. But in April, when the CEO and top management was denying all rumours of acquisition by Broadcom, the CEO drops a bomb via email to all employees of the company that Broadcom will be acquiring them. This followed the cycles of massive lay-offs contributing to the typical acquisition process of Broadcom. I can only say that it used to be a great company but post Broadcom acquisition, it will be seeing massive lay-offs (that is already in process) and soon like other brands that Broadcom acquired and destroyed (CA, Brocade, Symantec; etc.); it will destroy VMware on the whole too.

To back that up, the CEO is incentivizing managers to hire and promote URM and gender specific candidates.

Yes\u2026the overall market is down due to numerous headwinds. Yet, shouldn\u2019t VMware\u2019s rising diversity and inclusion metrics have cushioned the fall?

I made efforts to be open, honest and transparent with my feelings and how various scenarios were being perceived or handled, but it backfired. Two other colleagues were experiencing the same behaviors from one of the same executives, so we all went to Employee Relations with our ongoing concerns.

They don't seem to understand the technology, market or customers. A trifecta for VMware, but not the kind you want. Raghu is a non-charismatic leader who has done nothing to fix the systemic problems VMware had before his leadership started and since taking the helm has made things worse with poor leadership choices and a push for products that don't sell and a move to focus on SaaS and subscriptions for no other reason than to cater to the street.

I enjoyed my time there before the pandemic and the acquisition. The office culture was stellar, people were very passionate about the work we were doing, we moved quickly, and hired lots of new college grads who we could train and watch grow into spectacular engineers.\r\n\r\nSome incredibly smart people. Folks are generally collaborative and helpful when you have questions.\r\nBenefits are decent (high-deductible health plan has no premium; stock-purchase program gets you shares 15% off).\r\n\r\nFor some of us, there's a fantastic work-life balance. I was never questioned for taking time off. I was never made to feel bad for taking a long midday walk, or heading to the grocery store before the evening rush began.\r\n\r\nIf you live near an office, they're really quite nice. Boston has two downtown offices that have nice views and a very \"tech-corporate\" vibe. Whether or not that's your vibe of choice, you can't deny that they're nice places.\r\n\r\nVMware 401(k) plan in Fidelity supports \"mega backdoor Roth\" conversions for those looking to take advantage of that loophole.\r\n\r\nVMware's post-pandemic plan should never force you into an office.\r\n\r\nEven considering the forthcoming cons, I enjoyed my time there overall and wouldn't wish to undo it. \r\nI will preface the cons by saying that VMware is still a better company than 98% of American employers. In tech, I think engineers are overly spoiled for choice among the top 2% of companies. If you're coming from any other industry, VMware will likely be the best job you've ever had.\r\n\r\nBut, I wouldn't recommend starting a job there today if you have other tech-company options.", "cons": "VMware management loves to espouse their \"EPIC2\" values. If I have to be constantly reminded of what my values are supposed to be, I probably don't share them.\r\n\r\nVMware is broken into many different \"business units\" which are all essentially different companies. If you work in one, you'll have no contact with people in a different one.\r\nIn general this is fine, but the public marketing highlights interoperability of VMware's products with each other. Hard to back that up in reality, when I've never heard of the product I'm supposedly receiving API calls from.\r\n\r\nNo real corporate culture or sense of togetherness, possibly due to the sheer size of the company.\r\n\r\nDry (alcohol-free) offices except with special approval that requires a bartender to be brought in. Minimal snack offerings.\r\n\r\nVMware has a political action committee (PAC) led by Sen Orrin Hatch's (R-UT) former chief of staff. They did not stop contributing to elected congresspeople who were supportive of the Jan 6th Capitol insurrection. Lindsay Graham remains highest-paid recipient.\r\n\r\nSignificant attrition. At CB, we probably lost close to 50% of our engineers since the pandemic started.\r\n\r\nFull waterfall software development lifecycle (at Carbon Black, at least). VMware hired a number of managers from Docker and put them in charge of engineering, and they pivoted hard to a date-based, non-iterative software development lifecycle.\r\n\r\nCorporate all-hands calls are largely pointless. CEO has zero personality (though I do hear he's a very kind person) and is almost comically uninspiring.\r\n\r\nThe only tech stock to trend downward during the pandemic. That's saying something.\r\n\r\nWas often short on work to do. Spend lots of time sitting around. UX, Product, and Engineering have been split apart and no longer have direct communication. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my experience post-acquisition was generally less positive (and certainly negatively impacted by the pandemic).\r\n\r\nSignificant bureaucracy, at corporate and BU levels. Corporate started a committee to investigate the number of committees there are shortly before I left. Processes have been stood up at BU level that inadvertently strangle the ability to improve the products we build. UX is always \"too busy\" to help.\r\n\r\nDuring the pandemic, VMware built out significant presences in Bulgaria and India. These teams are generally very competent and work long hours, but communication is nonexistent between the geos. This is true across disciplines; engineers will find MRs making changes that their colocated UX/Product folks have decided against, and those folks will contact their cross-geo counterparts to find that they're of the exact opposite mindset regarding the functionality in question. Some teams rubber-stamp and merge code in the overnight hours of their cross-geo counterparts to avoid being blocked from merging.\r\n\r\nVery stingy about salary increases. Even stingier about promotions. Stingiest (perhaps most shockingly) about equity grants.\r\n\r\nVMware no longer hires engineers with less than 3-5 years of experience. With each year, college graduating classes get more diverse. VMware complains about never hitting its meager diversity goals, but they don't care or realize that the majority of racial and gender diversity in the engineering talent pool lies at the youngest end."}, {"review_title": "Great company.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Technical Account Manager (TAM)", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great compensation package, flexible work arrangements, company values, and incredible technology.", "cons": "May be growing too fast for staffing levels."}, {"review_title": "Information technology analyst", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everything at its best at VMware", "cons": "Nothing negative.
