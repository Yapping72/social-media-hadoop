VMware marketing is invisible or non-existant to most customers and to the field org. Go to market motion with channel is completely broken. Channel parters don't trust or understand how to grow business with VMware and actively sell against the VMware in many market segments (REL, F5, Crowdstrike, more). Sales management talks a good game (value selling and more), but in action it is mostly a churn and burn sales motion where field teams hover over accounts, harvest an ELA, and then try to dump the account to another sales team who will babysit the customre until the next ELA. The company makes enough money and realizes enough growth from Vshpere, that the other products are not effectively advertised, marketed, or supported by sales campaigns. Lying is tolerated and sometimes rewarded in the sales organization.

Great technology.", "cons": "The most disorganized company I\u2019ve ever worked for; we\u2019ve had a massive leadership change and the turnover hasn\u2019t stopped; they can\u2019t figure out why but here it is in a nutshell: we\u2019re a mess. \n\nEnablement is horrible; all focused on big picture strategy but doesn\u2019t give you the tools you need to actually close against competitors. You can\u2019t get in front of professionals and spout high level strategy every meeting, we need to know the how. Getting a quote built and out the door is a week-long process and upper management complains about how time consuming it is to constantly approve quotes; here\u2019s an idea, have set thresholds. If discounts are within a set threshold don\u2019t have a human clicking the box; save that for the deep discounts that require a manual touch. \n\nDeal reg program and partner program are labyrinths that make no sense. The person in charge of de-complicating the program quit after the last re-vamp and I believe may have checked out long before departure; there have been recent changes but when changes are made it\u2019s reactionary and they don\u2019t see the repercussions until it\u2019s too late & it\u2019s not very partner friendly.\nSales has hit their number yet their rolling out new metrics that micromanage and make it harder to do your job and only looks at certain output that doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with closing business. If you hired us to do a job, expect we\u2019re doing it and if we\u2019re not hitting our numbers then I can understand asking for us to log every single thing. They claim it\u2019s for uniformity and consistency, sure. Way too many emails, meetings, last minute all hands and lack of collaboration/communication across the business units. Lots of pressure, lots of red tape and lots of obstacles and too much busy work. Way too many bundles and things to learn and with the amount of turnover we\u2019ve had it\u2019s hard to find people to go to for help. \nIt\u2019s really hard to get your job done here and I hope we see things \u201cease up\u201d a bit from the micromanagement perspective. When you value logging calls/meetings quantity over quality, you really don\u2019t give the time and space needed to go after larger more strategic accounts. It becomes just another large corporation trying to fit reps into a box. We\u2019re having strategy conversations on moves that have millions of dollars tied to them and it takes a lot of coordination internally because we\u2019re such a mess. I\u2019ve actually chipped a tooth in my sleep from clenching and I\u2019ve never had this issue. I believe in our vision but the stress isn\u2019t worth it. These products take time to learn and if the turnover doesn\u2019t stop it\u2019s hard to get the support you need to close deals & creates s ton of unnecessary stress. Right now I would tell anyone I care about to stay away and I may be looking if things don\u2019t improve by q2."}, {"review_title": "An amazing company with the best culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 May 2022", "job_title": "Post Sales", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "EPIC2 speaks for itself in terms of value and how employees can contribute.", "cons": "Org structure can have quite a few layers to work through."}, {"review_title": "Good company seeking to reinvent itself in the Cloud Era", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Enterprise Account Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great legacy technology and customers.

They lure you in by telling you that they are all a family and you are now a part of it. They subtly exploit their employees in sneaky ways that you don't realize they're doing it until you're out of there. \r\n\r\nMy manager and his boss (this was in the Federal TAM team in Reston, Virginia) forced us into 8-9 hour meetings NON STOP with no breaks besides a short lunch break. The meetings have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE JOB. LITERALLY NOTHING. THEY JUST SHOEHORN US INTO DAILY NONSTOP MEETINGS FOR ZERO REASON. My manager and his boss made us order painting supplies with our own money (and they said they'll reimburse us later...2-3 weeks later) and forced us to do a \"painting and chatting session\" with them and my coworkers for THREE HOURS AFTER THE WORK DAY ENDED. When I think back to this moment, I'm starting to question if they have narcissistic personality disorder or they never had enough love and attention as children that they want it from their subordinates whom they have power over. \r\n\r\nMy manager assured us MULTIPLE times that we CAN keep our cameras off during these nonstop meetings that distract from actual work and that we only need to pay attention to the meeting. Then, my manager would meet with me privately on the side and berate me for not having my camera on. He'd also get aggressive with me over zoom and look at me angrily and give me evil eye stares and slam his desk with with fists HARD. He also rolled his eyes at me multiple times and he gives dirty looks to my other female coworkers (I'm female). I think he's secretly a misogynist. \r\n\r\nThe sneaky part is that they micromanage you but give you the illusion that you are not being watched. Every few weeks, there a multiple performance reviews given out by meeting leaders to the managers. \r\n\r\nBut the worst part is, my manager and his boss randomly fired me because I wasn't being a team player (in other words, I wasn't going to be exploited to their whims). I stood up to them and the next week, they fired me. My manager blocked me. His boss blocked me. There was no explanation. Just a termination. You should see the houses they live in. Multi million dollar houses. The week after he fired me, my manager had a two week vacation to Ecuador while I was struggling to pay for my sick parents who can longer pay their rent. And the worst part of it all is that they told me that they would never fire me because they made me go through 4 BS interviews and they like me and want to invest in my future career. My manager and his boss are lying, cheating, rich scum who need to be taken down to learn a lesson. \r\n\r\nMy coworkers are not any better. I had one coworker who seemed to be the leader of the subordinates and she'd schedule nonsense meetings ON THE WEEKEND. My manager said those were optional meetings, but then, as usual, he berated and embarrassed me in front of his boss at me for not joining. My coworkers would also create more work projects AFTER THE WORK THE DAY WAS OVER and contact me on my personal cell phone AFTER THE WORK DAY WAS OVER for NON EMERGENCIES.\r\n\r\nI really, really, really want to reveal my manager's name and his boss's name so that you know to NEVER work for them (even if they leave VMware to torture other employees at other companies). However, I'm waiting until I settle myself financially so that my future is not jeopardized. When that settles, I'll write a review again here and reveal their full names. My manager's last name is Miller and his boss's last name is Boertlein. Stay the heck away from VMware and them. They're a toxic and failing company. \r\n\r\nPlease, please, please, please listen to my warning when I say to avoid VMware at all costs (seriously only work here if you have no better options). This is not a joke review. I want to ensure that others see this review before deciding to apply to VMware or take a job there.\r\n\r\nAnd I hope you will avoid my former manager and his boss.

None of those positions have been backfilled; their work is simply piled up onto people who can't cope with what they already have, until they break down too. Customers regularly complain about the poor service they're getting, but management never step in to address these complaints, either internally or with the customer directly.
