I see a lot of reviews here being very positive on culture and values. Why? VMware donated to political candidates this year who oppose free access to abortion and called slavery \"a necessary evil.\" Mitch McConnell got VMware cash. We want to work with authoritarian regimes. 4.2 stars for company values btw.\r\n\r\nBut enough about values - your average Silicon Valley job seeker cares about money (I used to live there, I can say this). VMware cut 401k matching, and canceled promotions and pay raises for a full year due to the pandemic. That'd make sense, if our profits suffered, but they didn't, they topped estimates. Great! Well at least our stock - oh, it's been flat for 2 years. We're a tech company right?\r\n\r\nWell, the market might be right on this one. VMware doesn't have an exciting future, and it might not have a bright one. Will containers and Kubernetes kill virtual machines? They're at least going to do some damage. Watching from the inside as VMware scrambled to stand up \"Tanzu\", its own brand of Kubernetes that no one has ever heard of, has proven to me they're worried. I have no reason to believe Tanzu is anything revolutionary. It seems much more likely this is a company that peaked in one technology and will be behind the curve in the new one, for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nIf you're a VMware employee, rejoice! There are many, many better companies out there - if you think VMware is good just wait till you see them. If you're not a VMware employee, I hope this perspective has provided some contrast to the mindless one-liner reviews.

The first thing they will do is try to re-band (demote) the employees. They will use the excuse of they are a big company and things are different and you either take it or leave it. After a few months they will double the old company\u2019s workload and ramp up offshore efforts to help. \r\nUpper management will trash talk the bought-out company any chance they get in order to justify any changes (layoffs and reorg) they will implement. Upper management will shield themselves from the bought-out company\u2019s managers and employees so they can ignore their issues, concerns or complaints. They will make the bought-out company\u2019s managers accountable to the deliverables but have no responsibility or power, understanding or control of new offshore resources. Management who can, leave the company or quickly find a more stable group in VMWare to transfer to, leaving a huge leadership vacuum. As the bought-out company star team members leave, they will be replaced by untrained resources amplifying unreasonable schedules. \r\n\r\nThe new offshore resources will be dumped onto projects with no training or understanding of the project, team or technology. The team will not be integrated or even introduced to each other and will not be given clear goals or direction but will be given multiple and often conflicting deadlines and goals. The new offshore resources will have their own managers who have no goals or accountability to the new projects and often have goals and accountability for other projects. The bought-out employees will be squeezed into having to do their previously scheduled deliverables, new deliverables and somehow ramp up themselves on new products, VMware systems and help the new team (assigned 2 minutes ago) also ramp up. \r\n\r\nIf they fail on any of the three projects you are on, they will be called out for not being \u201cteam player\u201d. If they mention any organizational problems, they will be called much worse things. Upper management will berate you if you have even hint at questioning them, they will call you hostile, ironically screaming it at you. A person asked a simple question about unfreezing pay raises and an SVP went on a rage about cooperation and not being hostile. Its common for five hundred people to be on an engineering conference call and if the SVP doesn\u2019t filibuster the whole meeting to avoid questions no one bothers to waste their energy to ask a question or from fear of reprisal. Teams and information are silo-ed across teams and even from management to engineers. It\u2019s not uncommon for issues to ferment or fester for months and only when it\u2019s a crisis gets dumped on the engineers who can actually fix it with demands of why several month long outstanding issue has not been resolved, when the engineers didn\u2019t even know about it until that moment. \r\n\r\nOnce the ramp up is done, upper management expects quick results from the untrained disorganized mess they created. This is when some directors start working against each other. Some openly subvert and work against others to see which of them survives the next re-org or twice a year layoff. Upper management entire focus is on solving \u201ctheir\u201d problems and \u201ctheir\u201d goals, often to the detriment of the product, employees, team or even company.\r\n\r\nAs someone who has helped build a successful decade long offshore program, this is not how to do it. Upper management creates such an environment of fear from over aggressive schedules, and priority contradictions, poor communication, unwillingness to listen, layoffs, and hostility towards the bought-out company it fails before it starts. \r\n\r\nVMWare used the 2020 financial crisis to temporarily freeze 401k matching, bonuses, and raises all while exceeding their goals."}, {"review_title": "Senior Quantity Engineering Developer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "10 May 2021", "job_title": "Senior Member of Technical Staff in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work culture, benefits, pay, latest technology, location", "cons": "Not any specific down reason"}, {"review_title": "Good organization", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 May 2021", "job_title": "Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good organizational with great people", "cons": "Nothing to be mentioned at this time"}, {"review_title": "Amazing Company to work for", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Business Analyst I in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work Life Benefits, Employee Centric", "cons": "Though overall company policy is good, the real situation for you depends on your Managers unfortunately"}, {"review_title": "None", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 May 2021", "job_title": "Project Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a good company to work.", "cons": "No specific negatives to mention"}], [{"review_title": "Lots of diversity", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 May 2021", "job_title": "Member Of Technical Staff in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work, cutting edge technology", "cons": "Depends on team to team"}, {"review_title": "Awesome company but Americas marketing not so good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Senior Campaign Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing benefits, sign-in bonus, annual bonus, competitive salary, stocks on hire", "cons": "Too many changes in a short time, no consistency poor leadership in Americas marketing"}, {"review_title": "Great employer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 May 2021", "job_title": "Technical Enablement Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture, enthusiasm, taking care of people needs, putting people first", "cons": "Nothing to mention here, all good"}, {"review_title": "Good company now, but I don' t known about the future.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Senior Consultant in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary, working conditions, interesting jobs.", "cons": "future uncertainty with CEO changing and Strong competitors"}, {"review_title": "Great company that really cares about employees", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "VMware is a very employee-friendly company, it's a real pleasure to work here.
