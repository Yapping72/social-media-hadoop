		"pros": "Intel is a pretty stable company in terms of not going bankrupt anytime soon.  \r\n\r\nThey allow me to work from home 4 days per week, which is awesome.  \r\n\r\nThe corporate line is that the pay goal is to compensate \"above market average\", so for most people they pay is quivalent to what they would make elsewhere.  \r\n\r\nThere are many diversity programs and clubs in which to participate and there is both a stock grant program (RSU) and a stock purchase program (15% discount) for all salaried full time employees.  \r\n\r\nIntel is piloting a new program that will replace all of the old gray cubicles with fance new ones and a new layout, so the workplace is not as drab (or will soon not be). \r\n\r\nIntel offers free coffee and soda in the cafeterias.  \r\n\r\nThe opportunities for advancement are present at intel, but no one is going to advance you for free.  Intel expects that employees own their career and make career and skills choices that would lead to advancement, if that is what they want.",
		"cons": "Because Intel has the policy of generally paying \"above market average\" this has the effect of retaining employees who are aware that they are overpaid and not attracting the employees who could (and should) be making WAY above market average.  \r\n\r\nThere have been, over the years, numerous \"redeployments\" where employees are asked to find another job internally or leave (within 3 months, normally)  this has resulted in the attrition of about 20000 employees over the last few years.  So, naturally, people are worried about their own job security.  Intel has also redeployed groups only to hire their replacements in cheaper geographies.  I have had the opportunity to train my replacement in India - that was fun.  \r\n\r\nThe benefits have been cut over the last few years.  Intel has cut the amount contributed to 401K programs from 10 to 7 percent and they have also modified, on more than one occasion, the formula by which bonuses are calculated (modified so that the bonuses became smaller, of course).  \r\n\r\nIntel does not provide state of the art laptops or desktops for its employees, which is baffling for a technology company.  Typically the hardware given to employees is a generation or two behind the fastest available on the market. \r\n\r\nOh, and one last thing, the cafeteria food is less than satisfactory."

		"duration": "N/A",
		"pros": "As an intern, the pay at Intel simply can't be beat.  In fact, it is very nearly what a newly-hired full-time engineer would be paid.  There are also several non-wage benefits, including relocation reimbursement, cash bonuses, stock options, and medical and dental insurance.  All of these great benefits are even available to interns!  Also, there were several paid days of Intern Outings, where all of the interns would go out to get ice cream and hang out at a park, or something like that.\r\n\r\nBesides the pay, the culture at Intel is great.  People are friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help.\r\nThe small working groups really help to make a large corporation like Intel still maintain the intimate feel of a small company.  Small groups are able to get things done more easily, with less interruption from the chain of command.\r\nAlthough the working groups have the feel of a small company, it is great to be able to leverage the resources of a large company like Intel.  With a strong focus on ergonomics and safety in and out of the office, Intel leads by example in providing its employees with the safest and most comfortable working environment possible.\r\nWith a great variety of special interest groups, Intel is a great place to keep up-to-date with new technologies, or just refresh your memory of things you once knew.",
		"cons": "Working in Hudson, MA, I was somewhat disconnected with the corporate offices on the west coast.  I have heard it said that the closer one gets to the corporate offices, the harder it is to get useful work done without interruption.\r\n\r\nFor interns on short work terms, like three-month rotations, the employee cash bonus program does not work well, since the amount paid is based on the number of work weeks since the most recent hire date.  This nullifies any weeks in the previous work term that were not already paid a bonus, since there was a termination in between.\r\n\r\nIn the Hudson location, there is some growing pain in the area of converging on a common tool chain.  I imagine that this is an artifact of the several acquisitions that have taken place over the years at this facility."

Some times it is difficult for the management know what their employees are doing on a regular basis because they are pulled in many directions. This requires the employee to focus on perception rather than the actually job. I felt like I was simply a number rather than a valued contributor to the company even though I have made significant contributions and  have saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars (not much for intel as a whole but justified my salary over 5-6 times over. Having one \"Needs Improvement\"  or \"Successful with no stocks\" rating during the annually review can result in a layoff 3-4 years down the road even though you have worked extremely hard to improve and become very successful and valuable member of the team. This does not layoff is not about saving money for Intel but the new CEO will regularly remove \"low performers\" to please stock holders. Extremely stressful because goals are always changing (but this is in the same in all semiconductor companies). The new CEO is very very focused on metrics on every level and ways that seem ridiculous to others from the outside. I was reprimanded for not meeting the quota for documenting minor safety caches i.e. I saw a person walk down the stairs without holding the hand rail and didn't document it. This is the level of detail of how Intel values metrics."

I felt we were more as a team as we were able to interact with other teams better working on the same project.\r\n\r\nStarting pay, RSUs and raises were once good like 5%, but ever since moving grade levels, noticed the raises were not as good. I got higher pay increases when I started off at a lower level than higher unless promoted.",
		"cons": "I am ranking these as I see fit.  \r\n\r\n1. Under BK as our CEO things have gone really bad like our benefits. We are making record revenues and profits every year, but somehow our money is not going back to the employees.  Our raises keep on getting worst every year and for RSUs, it keeps on getting worst value wise. I remember getting promoted from grade 5 to 6, 5 years ago and I got SSL2 stock worth $11K value.  When I got from grade 6 to grade 7 promotion my manager was only able to give me SSL3 stock worth only 7.5K.    Then, our 401K for retirement has not been reinstated back to 6%.  Our quarterlies funding drops as well, as we do not have anymore winter parties and are replaced with snag a snack day.  \r\n\r\nManagement always talks about cost cutting, but they seem to make some big acquisitions and spend a lot of money  on external executive hires and a lot of diversity propaganda.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of senior leaders that left the company that would have made a fine CEO in the future.  \r\n\r\n2. Go through many managers, (1 manager per 1 year) \r\n\r\n3. Working with other cross sites in way different time zones. Europe and Asia, always trying to find the right time to fit into our schedules. Sometimes we need to have meetings either late or early.\r\n\r\n4. Lots of reorgs, we go through once a year now.  I do not see the point why other than it creates a new position for someone wanting to be promoted\r\n\r\n5. Working on projects, we tend to work within our own team instead all different teams working together to solve problems.  \r\n\r\n6.  Lots of meetings that are sometimes pointless, find out which ones are important to attend. I tend to skip some because they are not relevant to me.\r\n\r\n7. Lots of Intel senior management that stayed within Intel for many years have left or \"retired\" during BK tenure and most of the upper staff tend to be folks we paid a great deal of money to hire on the outside.  They tend always want to focus on cost cutting instead of improving morale and culture."

Many of them express sadness that CR did not make an effort to retain them. This makes others want to leave (well that is how people work these days). \r\n\r\nIf you do not value them while they are here, they will not stay. The message we hear often is that we can replace you. I think it is up to the leaders to introspect if they are indeed replacing the talent that went away (or planning to leave).\r\n\r\nSeveral engineers complained that the messages they hear from leaders is confusing. If you fail to retain the key contributors , we will face a gradual decline in the ideas and quality of work. We will also have hard time to recruit (since the engineers will not refer someone knowing the state of affairs).\r\n\r\nBe proactive in retaining talent. If the engineers who push the ideas leave , we will have a serious issue. Decades ago, one could treat the retention with a power play, there is serious competition for talent today.\r\n\r\nABUSIVE POWER PLAY: Some of the leaders operate by power play, blocking access/stopping support/questioning essential expenditures/approval for literature to exert control over the engineers. This is abusive to say the least. The practice of punishing/abusive the engineers who have a difference in opinion  or plan, idea or ambition is hurtful. \r\n\r\nWe are surprised that in the world of #metoo, why Intel does not train the leaders to stop using their power play tactics. It may mean the difference between a retained employee and one that leaves. Use knowledge and logic instead of power play culture. \r\n\r\nI am ashamed to even share this with my colleagues at other companies how CR/TMG treats their employees."

Also if you really wanted to, you could work there for years without ever actually having to produce a single thing of worth to the company or your co-workers.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are some really great communication channels at Intel, although one must wade through quite a bit of bias to get to the real news.

There was never any rhyme or reason to which decisions your manager decided must be enforced, and which ones could be ignored.\r\n\r\nI even saw this inconsistency happen at the employee level.  One great example was when my division (which supported construction groups all over the planet) suddenly had telecommuting banned for all employees.  Within a month or two all of the women in my group somehow miraculously got \"exceptions\" to the telecommuting ban, while the two men in my group (myself included) did not.\r\n\r\nAlso, Intel is largely run by folks in their mid 50's.  Although the internal groupings of the company seem to be in a constant state of flux, the true corporate management structure changes little, with the same small group of people holding relatively identical positions of power regardless of their changes in job title.  There is no true hope of advancement in one's career for anyone younger than 45."

Most of my friends who've left have lost their higher paying positions at other corporations after a couple of years.  \r\n\r\nThat said, the work is challenging (at least in my area) and rewarding in a karma sort of way since you realize that many people around the world will use what you work on.  The people are all very bright, and I mostly enjoy working with my team a lot.  Things get DONE at Intel and done on time (mostly), because when they aren't, the world notices.",
		"cons": "Work / life balance depends totally on what group you work in.  Some groups are very liberal (Marketing, etc), but many groups are run by old timers who absolutely do not believe in ever 'working from home', and in some cases even closely track who gets to work at 8am and who doesn't.  Corporate is absolutely WORTHLESS in standardizing this and gives lip service to 'employee work/life balance' that means NOTHING.  In anycase, expect to work 50 hours a week at MINIMUM.\r\n\r\nThe ranking and rating/focal process is horrific and brutal.  It takes up about 4 months a year when you include normal focal and mid-year focal and the results don't justify it.  It DOES make the place a dog-eat-dog killer of a place to work, where you are never really sure you will not get rated low unless you are doing your best, but the paranoia it inspires and the pain is unneeded and unnecessary.  \r\n\r\nUpper management is very, very smart, and I am impressed by their ethics.  However, they are ruthlessly brutal and some of them will not hesitate to blackball you or run you out of the company if you cross them or fail to kowtow.\r\n\r\nBiggest downside for the average employee is that Intel, despite being a 'high tech' company gives it's employees absolutely CRAP computers to work on.  4 or 5 year old laptops are the norm unless you are doing silicon design or something that requires something newer.  When my monitor died a year ago I was given a new CRT monitor that I later found on Newegg for $60 and that I wouldn't have bought  even for use at my house, and which of course died after only a few months.  This sort of pennywise, poundfoolish idiocy abounds, except in the silicon fabs, where spending $100M on a new stepper is considered just the cost of doing business (which it is, but come on, so are decent computers for the engineers).\r\n\r\nAnother downside is that despite being insanely profitable constantly, management constantly looks for more ways to keep this money from the rank and file.  Profit sharing used to be 12.5% of salary when I started, then it went to 8%, now is at 7% and they are clearly positioning it to go even lower.  Health benefits are similarly being reduced.\r\n\r\nLast but not least there has been a strong 'diversity' push in the last few years, which would normally be great, but which has resulted in significant bias during focal and hiring AGAINST people who are not 'diverse'."

This means someone is always left holding the hot potato.  Instead of motivating employees to do better this has led to a back biting environment where the deceitful employees often are rewarded.  Those employees who can do \"do\".  Those who can't will lie.  Unfortunately the management structure at Intel requires even 1st level supervisors to be in meetings and to crunch numbers most of the time and this creates a disconnect between the workers and  those who should observing them closely.  The solution is for the workers to submit a \"weekly\" report of their activities.  This is where the deceit comes in.  Under-achieving workers simply fluff their report or outright lie about their activities.  They are often rewarded simply because they focus most of their efforts on producing weeklys that make them look good."

I really cannot say that about many companies, and if it weren't for the downsides of my job, it would have pained me to leave.",
		"cons": "Cons are always wordier:  human nature.\r\n\r\nThere were many cons for me, and unfortunately they eventually outweighed the pros.  Again, if you are looking for a job at Intel, I wouldn't discourage you from looking.  Just be aware when you get there it has the same kinds of problems ALL big companies have.  One in particular stands out:  Meetings, meetings, meetings and more meetings.  And usually meetings that waste a lot of time; the culture has a greater emphasis on social correctness and five minutes of \"chit-chat\" than it does work, and I do have an issue with that.  Particularly when you spend a good hour on a meeting that can get done in 20 minutes.  \r\n\r\nI also worked some ungodly hours on some issues for customers who decided a month or two later \"Oh, you fixed that?  It really wasn't that important.\"  And unless you are a social butterfly (I'm not) finding a new job isn't that easy.  \r\n\r\nI think your job at Intel is going to only be as successful as your team's collective desire and ability to win.  People are generally risk-averse and like job security.  It pained me to watch the young interns sitting next to me love their jobs and do so well on their team, while mine settled for mediocrity and my own mind started to stagnate because it was being stressed without being appropriately challenged.   I worked with good people who were discouraged and felt powerless, and I was turning into one of them. Once I recognized this, I waited for the right opportunity to leave and did so.\r\n\r\nYour manager can change in the blink of an eye.  This can be useful, but it's not great for relationship-building/team-building.\r\n\r\nNot everyone is always promoted from within.  Managers are more concerned with how they look when promoting someone, as opposed to promoting the people who can do the job.  \r\n\r\nBut in the end... it's the stress of the job that'll do you in, combined with the ridiculous rating system.   It's too easy to get a \"Meets Expectations\" regardless of whether you are working your tail off and achieving, or slacking because you've been there too long and are burned out, and need a BETTER challenge."

Profit sharing, 2 types of bonuses.\r\n\r\nCareer options are plentiful, and many people are able to stay at Intel doing many jobs over their career in different groups while moving horizontally or vertically.

I found myself pigeon-holed into the position I was hired for (I love doing it but didn't get to branch out). I tried to step out of my narrow field of work a few times to explore my passions, but found that other's felt that I was stepping on their toes and did not appreciate the help I was providing.\r\n\r\nI also found the office politics too much for my liking."

		"cons": "Management can be kind of a top-down dictatorship, at least in the manufacturing division.  \r\n\r\nTelecommuting for the sake of telecommuting (general work/life balance) is not permitted in TMG. You can only telecommute in cases like a sick child, plumber coming out to the house, brief personal medical situation or illness, etc. Some TMG groups that are more distant from the manufacturing line still allow the old policy of one telecommute day per week (in violation of the policy), so you may have it better if you're in one of those. The current policy is probably better than some other companies, but Intel TMG's ban on telecommute is recent (within the past few years) and it a step backwards compared to other forward-thinking companies that are embracing employee flexibility.\r\n\r\nAlong with the new office design has come a tops-down mandate in many orgs where people no longer have their own desks. Depends on which division you are in, but you many not have any space to keep personal belongings at work -- no locker, let alone a desk.  \r\n\r\nHigh expectations and high stress for employees who are tied to the manufacturing line (fabs, assembly/test), and groups are always understaffed.  More work to be done than a group could do even if it doubled its headcount. On-call is common, and for some people can be 24/7, 365.\r\n\r\nIntel has a large manufacturing presence in the U.S. compared to many other companies that have entirely moved manufacturing overseas. This fact is held over Intel employee's heads, e.g. \"you better meet these impossible expectations no matter what cost to your personal health, or else ...remember, we are competing with Asian wages.\"\r\n\r\nIntel completely missed the boat in getting into mobile devices/ iPhones. Company outlook will always be questionable because of that.\r\n\r\nThere isn't really an \"internal transfer\" process if you want to move to the same job role in a different state. Any time you change departments, it is an interview process. \r\n\r\nMany managers have just gone up the ladder from engineer to group leader - some managers are good, but for many, technical aptitude does not predict that someone will have aptitude at managing and developing people."

		"pros": "Competitive environment focused on performance metrics:  Generally the high level CSI (Critical Success Indicators) are well chosen and focus on the business outcomes so teams are focused on the \"corporate good\".  This is critical to keep the large teams (100's to 1000's of employees) targeting their attention on what needs work (yield, cost, cycle time, product development cycles, employee satisfaction, safety).  You know what to focus on to affect your bonus.  The HR policies/standards are generally good and are not influenced by the \"flavor of the month\" trap that smaller or dysfunctional corporations can fall under.",
		"cons": "Competitive environment focused on performance metrics:  At a lower layer, the mantra of \"what get's measured gets done\" can lead to excessive measures of tangible micro considerations.  The difficult to measure intangible performance considerations are too frequently ignored.  The combination can create a culture of \"turning-red-boxes-green\" which actually don't matter to the business.  \r\n\r\nLeaders of the valuable cultural attributes can easily become whacked in the review process.  Especially when managers are changed on a frequent basis (I've averaged 1.5 managers/year, not counting two in the box managers of my work).\r\n\r\nThis can result in team members being rewarded for the wrong behaviors.  Also the individual performance evaluation (focal ranking and rating process with forced distributions) leads to dysfunctional team dynamics (political, back stabbing behaviors).  When your livelihood is on the line, individuals morals become fully revealed overtime.  Over my service I believe I have seen at least 6 head count reduction actions, split pretty evenly between \"voluntary\" and \"involuntary\" actions.  Given forced distributions, there is always the chance that a bad review year will combine with a involuntary head count reduction.  Many good folks are being let go this time around and Intel's competitors will benefit from the skilled people being released.  \r\n\r\nIn this environment Exempt employees can expect to work +60hrs/week minimum."

(5) The automation systems we have in place do improve, albeit slowly  (6)  Nice high deductible health plan with health saving account (7)  Very nice gyms with knowledgeable trainers (personal and group) available.

(2) the work can be repetitive, especially with regards to filling out paperwork for tool errors (Q&R system) (3) Passdown is a daily meeting that could be done electronically but they decide to have everyone come into the fab for a ritualistic meeting.  (4)  Too many meetings, though this is probably true of all companies.  (5)  No option for standing desks (though we could by our own commercially available desktop units)  (6) They recently laid off  alot of people based upon the level of stock grant.  However the stock grant was not awarded based upon merit evenly across the company, and so many people are now locked out of the company forever because they were supposedly laid off based upon merit.  Luckily I had managers with the foresight to be generous with stock awards.  (7)  Cubicle farm like most companies.  (8)  If you want to be promoted you have to work on the high profile projects and get noticed.  There are only so many of these to go around so yes talking with people and going to the meetings is worthwhile for career advancement.  (9)  Difficult to move horizontally in the company unless you know people.   \r\n\r\nI would not rate this particular job to a friend but maybe other positions involve more interesting work."

Now the benefits are lower but the salaries remain the same.\r\nSmall working environment.  Never had offices.  Started off with gray 72 sq ft cubicles.  Then they \"compressed\" the cubicles to 48 sq ft.  Then they replaced the 6'-tall gray cubicle walls with 5'-tall tan walls to \"facilitate collaboration\".  This just made things noisier.  They also shrunk the furniture to make your 48 sq ft veal pen feel roomy.  Now they are compressing these smaller cubes into 36 sq ft.  It feels like some sick and twisted version of Moore's Law applied to office space density.\r\nCompany used to emphasis the culture and our six core values.  Not so much anymore.  I think that was an Andy Grove thing.  Last few CEO's appear to have been made from a different mold (although the same mold) -- less emphasis on the employees that made the company great and more emphasis on responding reactively to the bottom line."

But one I need clarify, if you want to be a leader and stay there for decades you need to be brutal. \r\n\r\nWork life balance: It varies from group to group. If you are in the CMOS manufacturing (which is main area Intel is the leader) then work life balance is bad. If you are more away from the wafer, things are far better. \r\n\r\nCompensation:  I have interviewed with several companies in bay area and wanted to give an idea about this.\r\nRemember this is not software company, so comparison with Google, FB, will not be meaningful.\r\n\r\nBase Salary: Average, or below average compared to other hardware companies. Annual increase in fab locations (Oregon, Arizona) is low. But in Santa Clara is higher. However they compensate this low salary by other things (see below)\r\n\r\nBonus: In last few years overall bonus varied from ~14%-19%. If you notice, the minimum bonus is ~14% which quite high for many other companies. So, if you get an offer in other companies keep in mind that Intel regularly pays good bonus (compared to HW companies).  Profit sharing Bonus: Quarterly, Performance Bonus: Annually.\r\n\r\nStock Refresh: This will be variable, for a 6 yr experienced Intel employee, I was getting ~$20k annually (this is stock level 2, where stock level 1 is the best). vest in 4 years with one-fourth yearly\r\n\r\n401k: IMPORTANT: even if you DO NOT contribute anything, Intel deposits ~5% of your annual salary in 401k. Means, if your annual salary is $100k, you will get $5000 in your 401k even if you dont contribute anything. Catch is: it does vest immediately, you need to stay for 6 years to get all vested, if you stay for 4 yrs or less only 40% will be vested.",

There's an execution problem that seems to be an outgrowth of middle management and certain critical product groups really not \"getting it\", \"it\" being that Intel faces an existential threat and can't afford to do things the way they've always been done.  Upper management is driving a culture change, but a not insignificant number of folks seem to have missed the memo.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Fundamentally political and bureaucratic environment\r\n\r\nOne of the firs things you'll hear when you join Intel is that it's exceptional in being a results-oriented meritocracy.  Drink this Kool-Aid at your own peril.  It is very much your usual corporate America environment.   Your success depends entirely on your manager and his/her manager.  Play the game or lose.  And losing in the current environment can mean losing your job.  \r\n\r\nAlso, in a company with the size and complexity of Intel, the number of stakeholders that need to \"buy in\" to any decision worth considering is staggering.  It can take forever to affect change and inevitably you will run into at least one person who will need to be dragged kicking and screaming to accept, or even try, something new (see point #1).\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  Subpar compensation and increasing duplicity from upper management on compensation\r\n\r\nIntel's explicit strategy on compensation is to pay better than market in good years, at market during avg. years, and below market during bad years...and there haven't been many good years recently.  \"Raises\" are essentially inflation buffers, and there have also been a number of changes to bonus calculations (large part of comp and the main lever for pay) and retirement/pension plans that are thinly veiled pay cuts.  Management seems to be resistant to being forthcoming about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Recruiting/staffing \"strategy\" is a mess for everyone involved\r\n\r\nThe company pays a premium for \"top tier\" talent, but any effort to differentiate between \"top\" talent and others seems to be abandoned when candidates are placed.  A significant amount of Masters and PhD hires are paid top dollar only to be tool or design monkeys, and they hate their jobs.  Stars from OK schools are understandably frustrated when they compare notes, and older managers are not immune to jealousy either.  It's a lose lose for everyone involved.  Intel's locations are horrible for attracting younger talent as well.  Phoenix, Portland, and Folsom are less than stellar locales for young professionals.  \r\n\r\n\r\n5.  \"Lifer\"/\"True Believer\" culture becoming more intense in the new, more challenging environment\r\n\r\nIntel's taken pride in being a company with a culture that induces people to \"commit\" to being lifers or jumping ship early.  Middle managers seem to have the directive to weed out people they think aren't in it for the long haul.  The kind of openness you can have about medium or long term goals is limited.  This is something to be conscious of."

If you have a bad one, there is almost zero recourse to change that, and your career will suffer quickly. AS a large corporation, interdepartment politics plays heavily, and often workers suffer from the bad ideas of one department impacting others, and too often, silly decisions are made with no regard to impact on others.  One example:  In order to save money, the training department fired personnel who used to prepare the classrooms with materials, schedule classes, etc.. THen, every other department had to start printing their own materials for every class, schedule classes without a central booking feature, and suddenly, classes were held without teachers, without students, rooms conflicted because two classes were scheduled together, and every teacher suddenly spent hours more per class in the photocopy room, making booklets for classes than ever before.  This lead to frustration, lost time, and an abandonment of the program by the volunteer teachers, which lead to fewer classes, which lead to fewer trained workers, which forced the training organization to hire new people to straighten out the mess, and we are back at square one, except our experienced class managers are fired, new, inexperienced ones are taking their place, and the teaching pool is reduced from frustration.  And, thousands of man-hours have been wasted on the effort."

The most obvious downsides include: Intel is a large, I repeat large company - having over 80,000 employees worldwide, recognition and feeback at Intel corp is nearly non existent, and carreer advancement and ability to move up is extremely inhibited.  In my humble opinion, all of Intel's problems stem from its size (my first point against it) but I will elaborate on the main two deficencies stemming from the shear size.   Feedback at Intel is a once/year process and it is written by the employee him/herself and thus not true feedback, recognition (read reward) is an extremely bearucratric process driven by corporate distributions of how the company should reward on a whole.

The resources of a large company allow high dollar projects and collaborating across the world. Vacation time is not recorded for salaried employees and is mostly managed by the employee (and maybe his manager). Schedules are often very flexible for engineers (not technicians or FAB employees). Personal growth is encouraged and there are programs to try and help employees expand their skill set. Retirement contribution of ~5% is given annually to a 401K, regardless of the employees own contributions (i.e. not matching). Paid sabbaticals are given every 4 (additional 4 weeks) or 7 years (additional 8 weeks). That is probably the main advantage of working at Intel over similar companies in the area.",
		"cons": "Being young at Intel is very difficult. Employees are considered \"new\" until they've been here 10+ years and given little respect. The raise / promotion system is heavily dated and causes serious problems within groups and among peers (strict quotas for promotions and ranking employees within a group). The benefits across the board have been heavily cut over the past 5-10 years, resulting in a significantly worse overall package than before. No shuttles available at the main headquarters (to SF, San Jose, etc). Vacation is nothing special (3 weeks until 10 years, then 4), vesting for retirement contribution is incredibly long (6 years total, nothing until 2 years - 20%), and vesting for stocks is also long (4 years)."

Compared to competitors, they heavily rely on vendors which relieves a lot of equipment work from employees. This make working easy and still receive average salary. Which is a lot of pay for doing so little. Competitors require more out of their employees for this job title.

Less time in FAB :-) True open door policy without fear of retaliation from manager.",

They promote a work life balance but it does not apply to manufacturing technicians due to non exempt status. Also promote \"you own your career\" philosophy but again does not apply to non exempts. Career development only applies if you want to stay in manufacturing or if an exempt. This is contrary to  new employee orientation. Focal process is a 'meritocracy' which is a great idea but not true. Focal is based more on perception of work rather than true work and contributions. Decision making process is slow rather than \"small and rapid improvements' as preached. Corporate break schedule is not enforced by manufacturing management. This leaves employees abusing breaks which put a burden on the \"true\" workers. Probably a contributing reason that impact productivity. Especially since there's a dedicated workforce, \"remote operations\", to processing wafers but don't really do much but monitor screens for faults; then notifies a floor manufacturing technician. Management does not utilize remote operations manufacturing technicians, and floor technicians don't want them too. This probably is more for a sense of job security."

Advancing down the technical career path at Intel, strictly speaking from a software perspective, usually means losing a huge amount of relevancy in the outside world - no companies outside of Intel need an expert in the politics and methods required to get things done within Intel. For this reason, I saw many of the most talented software folks leave after several years from fear of resume rot.\r\n\r\nAnother point to be aware of for just about everyone at Intel, assuming you are ok at your job, your quality of life will depend almost entirely on who your direct manager is - and if you don't have a good one, your life will be miserable. Even if you are exceptional at your job, your career will go nowhere without a decent manager backing you. Spend too long under a not-so-great manager, and your career will be irreparably damaged - this is not a statement of hyperbole or jest. The way the employee ratings and ranking system is arranged requires that your manager play a serious political game, and if they are unable or unwilling, you will end up stalled. \"Stall\" too long - even being a key contributor to a business critical project- and you will get flushed by HR - also not a joke."

The more one knows about where to get it and who to get it from matters more than an acquired technical or business skill. So people new to the company often struggle.\r\n- Below par base salary in the industry. It may not be the same case for engineers especially working in the areas Intel has its vision in (Self- driving, AI etc), but for most of the support functions like IT and HR for instance, compensation is not competitive. \r\n- So many managers! Most of the managers I have seen are pure people managers and do not have in-depth technical or business knowledge to contribute in critical projects.  If that's the only job a manager has, unfortunately many of them don't do it well. I attribute the reason of this to institutionalization. People just get so used to the culture which is not really modern and forward-looking. May be Intel can take a leaf out of new-gen companies like FB or Google in this regard.\r\n- Its hard to get a true feeling of belonging in this company. Its huge and there are so many people who are not co-located but work in the same teams, people just work in emotional/professional silos.\r\n- Blurry visibility on career growth.

At the most people tend to get grade jumps but even those are not without a lot of political ground-work, infighting and unpredictable.\r\n\r\nIn short, I would not hesitate to work for Intel, but I would always be on the look out for the grass on the other side and will jump ship at the first decent opportunity without thinking a lot."

However, in larger organizations at Intel, management tends to try and fill positions as quickly as possible (or risk losing headcount). This results in there being a lot of engineers that don't have the skill set needed to do their jobs well, which can be very frustrating.\r\n* Numerous 'big personality' types at Intel. These are usually very senior and principle engineers that have been in organizations for a while. They are easy to identify; their names will come up in conversations when discussing new ideas, usually in fear that the 'big personality' will come down from their high altar in the mountains and smite anyone that doesn't conform. Often these people bring little value to the organization, but they've managed to hold the organization hostage due to their long term presence and 'wisdom'."

The work is very difficult, but successful engineers thrive in that environment. Intel also has a dominant market share now, and it is rewarding to be working for a company that wins.

In an 86,000 employee company, this can be frustrating - one knows that other people have probably solved or at least encountered your problems in the past, but it is hard to find those people.  Additionally, the culture at Intel is relatively direct and for certain people this confrontational style can be intimidating.  In certain organizations (notably IT), morale is currently low because they have experienced significant cuts in their headcount."

It is such a challenge to inject new ideas that one is often resigned to accepting what management wants.

RSUs and stock options are a significant part of the compensation package but if the stock is not performing to expectations, Intel must revise their compensation and reward system in order to retain their talent as well as reward employees for stick with Intel."

Intel also highly encourages employees who are getting burned out or bored at their current job to seek another job within Intel.  This is a benefit from my opinion in that you are able to always stay in a job that is entertaining and challenging.  Another good thing about Intel are the health benefits.  Though like everywhere they have increased in cost over the last few years, they have helped me and my family significantly throughout my years of working there.",
		"cons": "I think the biggest downside of Intel would be the lack of recognition for effort and the complete recognition for delivery.  This means that it is extremely important to ensure that you are personally involved in projects that are well funded and have the support of management.  If you end up in a position that does not have that, advancement and recognition will both be difficult.  It also has the potential to reward people who merely happen to be in the right place at the right time versus those produce the best and most complete solutions.  Another downside of Intel is that they tend to pay on the low end of the industry average.  Something else to keep in considersation is that Intel is a silicon manufacturing company.  And as such, they always have their focus on hardware development and manufacturing.  This can result in less importance being attributed to other areas that the company works in (i.e. Software Development)."

		"cons": "Intel\u2019s work culture is based on the book written by Andrew S. Grove titled \u201cOnly the paranoid survive\u201d. Intel HR policies and management promotes this culture of paranoia in every employee of Intel. Per Wikipedia \u201cParanoia is a thought process heavily influenced by anxiety or fear, often to the point of irrationality and/or delusion. Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory beliefs concerning a perceived threat towards oneself. Historically, this characterization was used to describe any delusional state.\u201d \r\n\r\nAs far as what I have seen, this kind of practice of making employees paranoia has made many or most Intel employees unhappy. In addition to the three letter abbreviations used at Intel, there are many other phrases used at Intel such as \u201cslap on the face\u201d. Simple things such as someone asking you a question while you are explaining to a group is \u201cSlap on the face\u201d since you did not do your job well enough to explain properly. I totally disagree with this kind of philosophy and it leads to a culture of un-openness. \r\nSimply asking your manager a question on his/her direction or suggesting some alternative solution which is better could get you labeled as \u201cdifficult\u201d. Why? Because first of all, if your manager agrees to your suggestion, it would imply that your manager was wrong or did not think through. As such, your manager would fiercely fight back to any suggestions which are contrary to what your manager thinks. Secondly, your manager suggestions might be based on his/her politics or anger towards someone else which your manager could not explain to you properly. I once found mistake that someone else did which could have cost up couple of days of downtime and when I told my manager, she responded that this is not what I asked you to do and rebuked me. The person who made the mistake actually thanked me for finding that mistake. So, I also think that a lot depends on who your manager is. Some manager wants you to do exactly what you are told without thinking but the problem is when things go wrong, you get all the blame since you did not think it thoroughly. Makes sense, no.. right? Welcome to the world of paranoia\u2026 enjoy working at Intel!"

If you put in the time and energy to learn and succeed, and express your interests in where you want to go to your manager, you will almost always have the support to help get you there. Continuing education is well supported (both through work/life balance and through reimbursement in some cases). Opportunities to do rotations and explore new fields/roles are abundant.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I like that may be a deterrant for some people is the very direct culture: People will tell you if they think your idea needs work, but the culture is very data driven and you work with some very smart people. As long as you support your position with data and logic you will pretty much always be fine. \r\n\r\nWork/life balance flexibility is great - 1 day work from home per week, other flexible hours options upon manager approval. Can't complain about the flexibility. In terms of work - to be successful you need to take on a lot of work, and it can be stressful at times, but if you like a challenge it can be pretty awesome.",

As such, I don't feel like my compensation reflects my experience, education, level of responsibility, or the value I bring to the company any more.\r\n\r\nPay is allegedly based on merit, but I have not seen much evidence for it. You have to earn your promo several years in a row before you'll get it... If you're also buddy buddy with your manager. \r\n\r\nWe like to make things hard on ourselves at times and need to invent a new tool for everything - even when there's a good off-the-shelf or previously created solution that could be easily adapted."

And of course this varies greatly from site to site - New Mexico seems to work the least and Oregon by far works the most.  \r\n\r\nIf you are good at your job, you will receive praise and recognition, but you will be expected to do it forever.  It is very easy to become pigeonholed into a solitary role for many years.  You need to actively seek out new opportunities to widen your skill base because Intel won't do that for you.  In fab/sort the ONLY way to be promoted to a manger is if your DIRECT manager leaves Intel or moves to another group, and you are the senior engineer in the group.  By default, you will be promoted.  There is no annoucement, no call for applicants.  You could be a senior engineer in one group for 10 years and be excellent at what you do...but someone with far fewer years and experience and awards will be promoted to manager simply because their manager left to do something else.  The promotion system is incredibly unfair."

I've always found people at Intel very helpful - if you ask someone for help, you will get it.Decisions are all data-driven - the first step is always to gather data -- an if a problem is urgent, to expedite the gathering of the data. Data and model-based problem solving are used extensively. At the engineering level in the fab, there is little \"politics\" - due to the data-driven decision making. \r\nSafety is the #1 priority in a fab - and the management sincerely promotes this - and backs it up with dollars to make safety improvement inside the factory and office areas (especially ergonomic equipment).\r\nSkills that will help you in the fab are knowledge of extracting data from databases, statistics, and data analysis with JMP. A little programming knowledge will help you as well.\r\nPeople at Intel don't like to finish second. Intel likes to win. Intel demands to be the champion.

On the bad side, the managers can focus too much on the problem of the day and not on longer term things like people development, career coaching, and other \"softer\" management functions.

Likewise I'm there to help when my coworkers need it.\r\n\r\nThere are also a lot of little perks such as raffles from the \"Great Place to Work\" team where you can win tickets to movies, sporting events, concerts, etc.  There are a number of fun activities planned by individual teams and entire sites to celebrate or just get to know each other better.  One great activity that just completed was a kid's day where we could bring in our kids for fun science and technology events all day.  My son loved it.\r\n\r\nOverall, the work environment when you have found the right team is very enjoyable.",
		"cons": "The most difficult thing for me about working here are the politics.  Unfortunately within the leadership and management layers, there are a lot of entrenched folks that seem more interested in promoting their own career than in doing the right thing for the company.  Because of this, I have seen some terrible decisions made that set the entire company back and took many months to recover, but there was no accountability held to the decision maker for this.\r\n\r\nIt can be very frustrating to be passed up on a promotion only to see someone less deserving but more politically savvy promoted instead."

It can be noisy, but I find them supportive and collaborative .    \r\nHealth Benefits - Intel also offers a strong benefit package and managing those benefits - from your PC - can be easy as well.     \r\nDiversity - The company has taken a strong stance on encouraging diversity and equal pay for women.",
		"cons": "Work hours - Since Intel has a worldwide presence, many managers (but not all) expect  their employees to work outside 9-5 hours for meetings with other regions.  A few years ago, the company pushed work a more forgiving work/life balance, but those days are gone b/c of the new CEO.\r\nLong hours - Long workdays are expected, and as part of the culture, checking email and performing other work occur in the evenings. \r\nCrying Poverty - Intel frequently takes spending actions to reduce expenses and enacts layoffs and moving jobs overseas.   It is kind of amazing for a company that makes billions and billions of $, but I called it \"Intel constantly cries poverty\".  \r\nRaises/Promotions - Significant raises and promotions rarely happen unless the employee takes the initiative to actually apply for a position outside of his/her group.  Big raises and promotions will not happen based on one's own merit of working hard.   My biggest advice is anyone at Intel is don't stay in a job or a group for more than 2-3 years and make every move a new job promotion.   You can be wildly successful at Intel, if you don't get comfortable  at one position."

I helped in the initiation of new hires and within a couple of months we were a team of 8. I tried my best to be a team player but I never got the same feeling from the other members. My manager was extremely ambitious and most people did not like him since he was new at it. I had no such issues and was actually very impressed with his work ethics. I also did not like how much time was spent in meetings. If I had a few more experienced and helpful people in my group, I think I would have left with a less bitter taste.

This makes work somewhat competitive and does not promote teamwork. These grades are also solely based on what your manager thinks, therefore if your manager does not know how much work you are doing, you may not be graded fairly despite this being your manager's fault. A bad manager can really prevent your career growth at Intel, no matter how well you perform.\r\n\r\nCubicles are mostly compressed making space somewhat limited. There are no offices. Some higher ups receive larger cubicles.\r\n\r\nWork-Life balance is in the hands of your manager. Bad managers will tend to accept any project or requirements despite not having the head count, requiring that any current members of the group work overtime in order to meet these added requirements. \r\n\r\nRecognition can be extremely poor and unfair. Often some people that work on a project are not recognized for their contribution due to them not directly working with the customer. Other times people are recognized (such as managers) for completing under resourced projects even though they do not contribute anything."

		"pros": "First, Intel provides a great place to work with effort made by the senior management to constantly adapt and tune the company culture to reflect the \"in\" thing in the valley. For example, as a result of Conan O'Brien's parody of the company's gray walled cubicle farm's a pilot project to convert an entire floor in a Santa Clara building was launched and received tremendous approval from employees. Starbucks coffee shop style bays adorn the four corners of the floor with giant flat screen TVs, bookshelves, and bar stools etc. Also, hot beverages and cold fountain drinks have been made available free to all employees. \r\n\r\nSecond, technology runs through the company's veins. So anything technology related is valued and great many resources are thrown at employee ideas that sound worthy of further pursuit.\r\n\r\nThird, the management culture is cut throat. Hence it is a great place to spend a few years to sharpen your sword and get out and fight the war outside.",
		"cons": "First, It is a creaky ship and it is leaking from all sides. It is an old tech company with very little attrition. The main reason for this is the dot come bubble. Those who joined at least a few years prior to the bubble received stock options in spades and worth some money. Those who joined during or after the bubble really suffered and as a result have been leaving in droves.\r\n\r\nSecond, there is too much bureaucracy when it comes to career development and promotion opportunities. Those who suck up to their manager stand a better chance at getting promoted. Managers lie on a continual basis to employees. They promise the world before a project is about start and when the project is successfully delivered, they conveniently forget all the reassurances made earlier. They are self-serving assh*les who'd rather satisfy their own managers than their employees. Managers routinely make ass saving decisions rather than what's right for the project or the company. Employees usually suffer the consequences.\r\nThird, promotions are based on a rotation system although it is clearly stated that the company is a meritocracy. It is a socialistic meritocracy not an absolute meritocracy. As a result you'd have high performers routinely passed over for higher grade promotions in favor of lower grade promotions for someone else within a rank group. This unwritten policy is very shortsighted and ends up sucking talent away from groups."

Its not that i'm weak, its that they ask too much and don't care if its chaos. \r\n\r\nMy advise to folks is to negotiate very high if you want to work here, you could go years without raises or promotions."

As a salaried employee though, I didn't get overtime anyway. \r\n\r\nWatch out for the buddy network.  There are alliances which are built up and can cause you problems if you are not well liked by a powerful manager.\r\n\r\nFocal process.  This is based on 'perceived' contributions... like a popularity contest.  As you rise up the ranks, you need to boast how great you are and get involved with a lot of things (even if you don't really know what you are doing) to show how much influence you have on the project.\r\n\r\nManagement is not always honest to regular employees.  They offer alot of lip service when you voice a concern.  They have their own agenda, which may not be the best for their employees."

Doesn't matter if you are right or wrong, just matters if you can torture the data enough to confess agreement with your point.\r\n\r\nThe people I have seen who do well (i.e. get promoted quickly and rewarded handsomely) at Intel do one of three things:\r\n1. Invent the next iPhone.\r\n2. Succeed at solving very complex, intricate problems, saving the company (literally) millions.\r\n3. Use every moment at work to promote VISIBILITY for themselves, whether it is useful/needed or not.  \r\n\r\n They struggle mightily  with customer orientation and sometimes just don't understand why their ideas are not what others really want or need.  They do this basically because they are on a continual death march to not be considered a \"commodity.\"  They fear that once the point of \"it's just a processor\" is reached, their empire will crumble.\r\n\r\nAnd one more thing... as far as \"career opportunities\", yes, total agreement with others that their are many opportunities, HOWEVER the physical location of where you are at is directly related to said \"number\" of opportunity.  If you work at a plant that is outside of Hillsboro, Santa Clara, (maybe) Folsom, your \"opportunity\" starts to fall off VERY quickly.  So, choose your site carefully if you decide to join Intel."

I often felt like the company as a whole was on auto-drive, sticking to management styles, roadmaps, lifestyles that were familiar and comfortable to them, rather than taking risks and seeking true, sustainable positive changes. I witnessed an idea rejected because it wasn't on a years-old roadmap and thus deemed impossible to execute; Apple came out with devices that implemented the idea 6 months later. I sat in many meetings where the audience typed furiously on their laptops or snored loudly over the conference call during the presentation, giving 0 cares, or they pigeon-holed on a completely unrelated topic that delayed crucial decision-making. Everything at Intel felt like it moved slowly, bogged down by tradition and its resulting band-aid fixes/decisions.\r\n\r\nI also encountered serious issue with the company's management selection scheme. Managers seemed to be chosen based on how long they've been at Intel or what's on their outdated resume, rather than their demonstrated merits and character. When respected colleagues approached my manager requesting to change projects due to consistent sexist and demeaning comments made by the project manager, they were immediately told to quit whining or start looking for new jobs. When I approached my manager with concern that I felt unchallenged, was not experiencing growth, and reaching my potential, he told me that I shouldn't worry since learning the organization chart and how the different business units interacted with each other was still a major achievement.... UH, NO.... not after I've been there for about 2 years and I regularly expressed to him my goal to build my technical expertise.\r\n\r\nIn summary, based on my experience, Intel has some great people but if you're looking for serious growth and inspiration as a non-engineering designer, this is not the place you will find it."

		"cons": "Under some managers, resources were limited, scope fixed, deadlines dictated, overtime mandated, and there was very little by way of creative and innovative freedom.  \r\n\r\nIntel's annual focal process demands a full bell curve making it such that not everyone can be declared successful, even if all were.  Therefore it is common practice for managers to hire and keep a 'fall guy' around just so that they can meet statistical expectations.  Absolute preference is given to the minority classes when it comes to hiring practices, refferal bonuses, and promotions. \r\n\r\nAfter loosing a few key employees, my last manager started playing games with the focal process in order to retain employees he would dumb down job titles, suddenly you were a \"Software Engineer\" when previously you were a \"Senior Software Engineer\" and writing a minimal 1 page focal review for you, allowing for very little input, and minimizing statements of accomplishments.  This made it more difficult for us to transfer within the company, he knew that other internal managers would consider these reviews when you submitted yourself for a new job so the more worthless he made you appear the less likely you were to be able to move on.  When confronted on the topic, he assured me that all of Intel was now doing it this way now to save time because it was really just a way to facilitate a conversation of expectations between manager and employee.  I did some checking around with friends elsewhere in the company and found this to be an absolute lie.  Any and all attempts to raise these and other issues up the management chain just resulted in direct retribution from my manager, who managed to make my life even more miserable.  \r\n\r\nI once submitted an 'anonymous' ethical complaint about the very questionable practices of a colleague within the company, within 24 hours I personally heard from that individual who was herself investigating the complaint.  I learned the hard way that NOTHING is anonymous within this company and every complaint counts against you regardless of how valid it may be."

Yeah sure you can wake up late the next day, but with everyone else working in the morning, expect to get sounding/judging from the others.\r\n\r\nTeam activities, due to the overall culture in Intel (in my ex team in particular), team activities are usually forced or down right a waste of time. Watching movie (everyone watching different movie if I might add) in the cinema? How is that going to help with the team's morale? Outdoor activities are not any better, with managers not joining to managers joining, but not taking initiatives to lead the activities. You get the picture.\r\n\r\nWorkspace is a joke.

Employees are well-respected for the most part, and they are encouraged to provide constant feedback to their immediate managers as well as senior management. The work environment is still very egalitarian; everyone gets cubicles, even managers. I can imagine that would not suit some, but for me it's perfect. Work hours are very flexible, and Intel tries to accomodate different employees needs. Finally, there is the pride of working in a company that even now continues to be at the forefront of technology and innovation, and Intel does a great job avoiding the curse of stagnation that has hit other high-tech firms like HP or IBM.",
		"cons": "Intel is still a company that is often run top-down. Although individual employee contributions and creativity are recognized, there is still a sense of process and bureaucracy within which every individual contributor has to function. This is also true for the rating and review process, which is necessary but seems somewhat rigid in its evaluation mechanisms. Change is occurring for the most part, but change seems to be slow which I guess is unavoidable in a company this size."

		"pros": "Intel can sometimes be a huge and slow company, but the amount of thought and vetting they put into their products, and the way their products teams interact, is commendable.  Intel is very demanding, and very detailed, when it comes to getting out the right product, with the right features, and the best cost structure.  Intel is probably more focused on cost now than at any time before, and that's a good thing in this current environment.  You need to come prepared to defend any feature that you want to implement, and with product horizons that are sometimes 5 years out, that can be difficult.  Still, this level of structure has produced some of the best products in the industry.",
		"cons": "It's easy to get frustrated sometimes when you see people making poorly informed decisions, and half of my job is to educate and make sure that planners from other teams know at least as much as I do.  The products I plan for often need features to be available in other products, and it can be very disheartening if those features get ZBB'ed due to cost reasons, when the ROI from my perspective is huge, and the other product planners don't feel the same way.  I've seen great opportunities for innovation fritter away because the usefulness of these features was misunderstood.  Even so, it's very rewarding when you can make a business case for a technology, and get it through the justification process."

If you want to have a long career here, you can.\r\n\r\nIf you work in an office role vs. a factory role you have wonderful work flexibility.

Interspersed with lifers there are some very talented and motivated people as well. Once I built my network it was easier to avoid the lifers and get things done by focusing on the talented folks.

They enjoyed solving really tough engineering problems, but also liked to joke around and have a good time. My groups both presented very positive work environments and I felt fortunate for that. It made it fun to go to work.\r\n\r\nMy immediate management was very good as well. No complaints. They let me do my job without interfering and trusted my suggestions and input. Felt like like they actually listened to me. Harder to speak about upper management - I didn't have much direct contact with them.\r\n\r\nI felt compensation was very good as well. They have great onsite cafes, a bonus structure, stock opportunities, good salaries...Again - work hard, play hard.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a huge company that works on a lot of different products, so there are a lot of different opportunities for challenging, fun work (Even for Mechanical Engineers - lots of thermal/mechanical problems to solve!)",

If you want to be successful, you need to be able to put in those extra hours that all American corporate companies expect ( note you probably won't get paid for them).  \r\nThe upper management creates a stable environment which has been able to shrug off countless down terms in the markets in recent years. I have seen many people come and go over the years. But they have kept much of the core team intact and improved it. \r\nThey are great benefits. healthcare.  It is the safest company I have ever worked at. The conditions are excellent. there are lots of onsite areas such as gym, clubs, even hair salons, multiple restaurants at each site. 90% of the people who work there are good honest, hardworking and focused people. In every company, there are a few bad eggs. The work is challenging but fun if you are prepared to work hard and possibly willing to travel you will be OK.  For me I enjoyed 25 years, I traveled and lived in foreign countries, was able to take my family with me on occasion. You need to make a choice if corporate America is for you.",
		"cons": "If you are stuck working with an immediate superior who is abusive of his power or just weak minded they will float and could be in the position for a number of years.  I have found that middle management is reluctant to take action against a BAD boss, particularly in the EU regions. \r\nThat situation in itself has caused more misery for not only me but many, many of my colleagues over the years.  \r\nThey tried management feedback and when bad scores came back. the group leader called in HR and told us we just didn't understand the questions! This lead to a worse situation particularly for those who spoke out. So, in the end, everyone just gave OK feedback or didn't bother."

In my 2.5 years at Intel I neve sat down with a manager and went over my resume, my career goals or how I could advance my career. There was no guidence, no action plan and overall communications was poor. Intel takes a very responsible attitude towards safety but then leadership fails which was evident by a recent issue where employees were given a test on Lock-Out Tag-Out and the failure rate was well above 50%.

As a software engineer there are many interesting projects as well, from working Windows, Linux and Mac internals (not just drivers!) to whole operating systems like MeeGo.

The work environment is a bit soulless as well; drab cubes as far as the eye can see.

After those hours, a compelling reason for absence is okay, as long is it happens infrequently and nothing bad happens when you're away. \r\n\r\nIn 4.5 years, I never saw anybody get a raise better than the real inflation rate. For the people managers love (which seems to have little to do with performance), they get 3%. Managers there love people that will not speak up when given impossible tasks or when told blatant lies. Managers all manage up, meaning they want you to say you are on top of everything so they can go back to their meetings. When something falls through the cracks, they want to be able to say you didn't ask for help. They do not want you to actually ask for help, and if you do they will burn your time up justifying what you've been doing every minute, but they never take anything off your task list. \r\n\r\nThe few Managers I saw that actually spent time trying to help their team get their jobs done were laid off or demoted. Everything new that is rolled out is presented with the punishments for not complying. I never saw a new initiative or process rolled out with rewards or positive encouragement. Every failure, even mechanical breakdowns like welds breaking, are viewed as personal discipline issues because a good engineer knows the condition of all their systems. If you asked to upgrade the system and got turned down, the failure is your fault because you didn't specify when and how it was going to fail, and you didn't re-submit your request with better justification.\r\n\r\nI had an alarm that went unattended for 2 hours and caused a problem. One root cause was that they just laid off 2 of the 3 job positions that were supposed to respond to the alarm and hadn't figured out a backfill plan yet (normally 3 job positions are all supposed to make sure the alarms are handled). Two of the three were laid off, the ops tech was busy repairing other broken equipment, and the managers at the incident review rejected those root causes. The only root cause accepted was the ops tech thought the alarm was not critical and took two hours to respond. The solution adopted was to change the alarm message to sound more critical.\r\n\r\nI've worked for many companies, and I've never seen a place where deception by omission is the only way to keep your job."

While none of my managers were malicious, their net effect was categorically abusive. I simultaneously had a skillset that was too critical to my server project to allow me to take an offered SoC \"Hot Job\" (jobs identified as critical for the company's future), but not worthy enough to address the career growth reasons for my dissatisfaction with the project that led me to want to leave, but they still offered me nearly half a years pay to voluntarily separate from the company to make space to hire more engineers for SoC. Let that sink in - I had been offered an SoC-related engineering job and my group blocked my transfer then offered me a large buyout to leave the company because they needed to make room to hire SoC engineers. Again, nobody was being malicious here, but I was in the middle of three different ridiculous circumstances caused by decision of three different levels of management all acting in what, at some level, was the most rational thing for them to do. At no point did anybody stand up to say \"the company is paying a good engineer we could use in SoC to leave the company. That doesn't seem right.\"\r\n\r\nIntel will tell you largely and loudly about how much they value the people working there, but they have erected systemic barriers that allow pathological levels of cruelty towards these same people. Intel will shout until they are Intel-blue-in-the-face that they have these wonderful systems for recognizing and rewarding accomplishments, but they're very inconsistent in their use. I worked on my own time for two years creating an architectural firmware debugging GUI tool. After it was announced that I was leaving, architects and engineers from different teams and different projects popped up to make sure that the source code would be available once I was gone. Over 400 hours of my own time creating it, other engineers apparently thinking that preservation of the source for it was of paramount importance, yet it was never deemed enough of an accomplishment for either recognition or reward. I can think of few more stinging ways to wound a departing engineer. When the buyout offer was extended to everyone, 5 acceptees were asked to delay their departure because their skills were needed badly. I was one of those 5 and to this day one of my greatest regrets of my 8 years at Intel was agreeing to it.\r\n\r\nI offer this example for illustrative purposes to demonstrate the dysfunctional connection between Intel's intentions, and Intel's actions. That last tool was not the first time I had identified a need, spent my own time providing a solution, had the tool picked up by many other engineers but received no notice from management until I moved on -- it was the third. The problem is systemic with deep roots. It also isn't why I left. I left because my career growth was dependent on the cooperation of a junior engineer who was getting rewarded with annual review bullet points for non-cooperation."

Yes - they are still experts in their specific field of knowledge & can be great mentors for budding talent - but they are not good at going 'outside their box'.  \r\n\r\nSo, while the executive leadership has the right goals & the engineers have the talent to deliver anything... the middle management layers tend to live in a strict world of hierarchy, control, and 'fear' of doing the wrong things.  This effectively kills ground-floor innovative work.\r\n\r\nIf the idea didn't come from the chartered R&D team & didn't come pre-packaged with approvals, funding, etc... then that idea will never see the light of day. \r\n\r\nIronic - since 'being innovative' is the #1 task given to these middle layers from their bosses."

I traveled 2-3 times a year being in an engineering role.\r\nSome good positive aspects of the culture - Intel has a \"work-week\" (WW) based schedule (simpler to learn and more efficient), it at least declares a lot of good intentions (but in practice you may find a different picture), all kind of training is available to employees (a lot of mandatory programs).\r\nIntel has plenty of relationships in the industry.

Many times the multi-month work of whole department (not only my team) was thrashed, because some new boss would come and \"not favor\" your team and whatever result was done to that date. \r\nGlobal cross-team coordination effort was very low to non-existent. Teams would \"fight\" for resources, and have a quite unhealthy competition. Decision would be made with some irrelevant considerations, and forced down to my team. \r\nAs result, the culture actually experienced would not be really engaging. \r\n\r\nThe performance review process is essentially botched. Some much higher management essentially issues a quota on number of good performance ratings to your team. Then, you end up in a situation when no matter how much you tried, you'd be stuck at your performance grade, because no good rating can be made available to you (again despite the acknowledgement of high level of contribution and such). Example: our team received only one EE (exceeds expectations) rating, and my manager decided to use it to promote one particular employee (citing his family situation (he had a new child, etc), and his current lower grade). Others were given S (satisfactory) rating"

This leads to a pronounced work-life unbalance, and as Intel increases its product cadence that starts to happen more frequently.\r\n\r\nThough they have good options for learning, their career development process is very ambiguous and slow. It is highly dependent on the manager's mood (which can be beneficial or dangerous), there are no clear goals to achieve a promotion. It is also easy to see that the people who has staid in the company for more years have better chance to get one of the available promotions putting everyone else in the queue: so if you are going to enter Intel, you better ask for a salary that makes you happy for a long time."

Many top managers have left the company and now BK's right hand (Renee James) is also \"jumping ship\". One of Brian's strategy is to let go of experienced middle aged employees (35+) and replaced them with low paid interns and recent college graduates in order to cut costs (He recently fired ~4k employees who had been with the company for years and said more layoffs will continue). In one of his speeches to Intel Employees, he said that employees are disposable, all that matters is the survival of the corporation, continuity of Moore's Law and the name of the corporation. He has taken away many of employee perks: Work from home day, work life balance, team builder off-site's, etc... The moral of Intel employees is down and there is no job security - Therefore, employees are not performing at their best.  Management group is very \"clicky\" - they hire their friends and help them get into Mgmt by giving them top job reviews - but no one dares say anything because even though the feedback says \"confidential\" they are not - and once you get on the bad side of one manager, you are sunk. If you do a job really well and then want to move to a different position, your direct manager has complete control of your carrier development and may keep you on one role for as long as they want. Focal (yearly job reviews) are a joke... they have to be written by the employee in third person because managers are to lazy to write them and no matter how long you spend or how good you have sold yourself, the manager will still give top reviews to their preferred employees. Standard pay raises are between 0 and 3% per year - as of recent, pay raises average about 1%, since the corporation is going through financial stress - a 1% pay raise does not even cover the increase of cost of living. \r\nIs it a good place to work? Yes it is - but do not stay on one job for more than a year and be ready to leave after 3 to 5 years. The benefit of working for Intel is mainly to get the experience on your resume - it opens bigger opportunities - better pay - elsewhere."

Don't join Intel IT and waste your time here, Intel doesn't trust its employee (Only reason RSUs are awarded) when it comes to development projects, They just want to outsource everything and push you to maintaining the project.

The 401K and other health benefits have various options but the latest trend is to go for HRA to reduce monthly premiums.  In terms of stocks, they have been giving RSU's and that depends on performance.  the number of RSU grants is tied to a certain percentage at lower grade levels and then become a much larger number for staff level and above.

You spend far too much time navigating illogical processes that have no accurate documentation, if this is for purchasing or using your \"benefits\".  Corporate policies are years (decades?) behind the norm for high tech employers, if that is health benefits or workplace practices.  \r\n\r\nThe IT department itself, and any services provided by them is a perfect example of what can go wrong in a large corporate environment.  The IT department is obviously not accountable to making employees successful, they have ancient practices and do little to support users.  The policies they have in place for your personal mobile device or any computer system that you use is beyond draconian...and the policies are entirely illogical.  They force you to change the passcode on your personal phone every 60-90 days, however they don't use a single one-time-password (aka 2 factor authentication) anywhere within your standard IT systems.  If your business unit *allows* you to use a non-windows workstation, good luck on getting it to actually work. Most of the IT policies seem to be to just wish you luck and stop talking to you.  Their policies may work fine if you are in the fabrication facilities, however not if you work in a modern group focused on software as the security policies block many development environments from even working viably without spending 40% of your time playing cat-and-mouse trying to find how to work within the new policy, or the one that intermittently acts differently. \r\n\r\nThe work environment is pretty toxic, they reward \"lifers\" that have been there forever who then immediately dismiss new ideas as not being valid.  They obviously need fresh ideas (innovator's dilemma) however their own practices and structure often drown those ideas before they can even be discussed.  \r\n\r\nThe CEO tries to claim it is a \"growth company\" while doing nothing to modernize business practices, empowering employees, or even investing adequately in growth opportunity.  Most of middle management spends their time clambering over each other trying to grow their headcount and budget allocations rather than actually running there business units.  Everyone is building their own fiefdom with duplication of resources and effort, wasting massive allocations of resources in the process...until your team loses and then you get the axe."

		"pros": "- Employee Bonus is calculated against the market success of the business, to incentivize employees to push the business forward.\r\n- Stock Purchase Plan allows employees to invest upto 5% of monthly salary & purchase shares at 15% below market values.\r\n- Annual Bonus provides a much needed fiscal boost.\r\n- Restricted Stock units are awarded for successful annual appraisals.\r\n- Dependant on manager discretion:  Employees are permitted to work from home, take personal time to deal with personal crises & issues.  In the even of familial bereavement some companies allow 2-days paid vacation, I was told \"take as much time as you need\".\r\n- Training is readily available & encouraged in-house & outsourced (if not available in-house).\r\n- Employees are encouraged to own their own careers & identify knowledge gaps & pursue avenues of interest as this will only ever benefit the business ultimately.\r\n- The business is so vast & sprawling you may move between departments, shifting roles & organisations if your interest is piqued in another area.",
		"cons": "- Compared to other businesses, Intel's salaries are relatively low.  The logic being that the stock purchase programs, bonuses & awarding of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) makes up for the deficit in salary.\r\n- Stock seldom retains reasonable value.  Many of the old guard (folks having served 15-20yrs) are stuck with no small quantity of shares purchased at nearly twice the current (2017) stock va lue.\r\n- Restricted Stock Units (RSUs):  Sound like a great annual bonus, until you realise the units have to remain owned by Intel and/or the stock management company for YEARS before you're permitted to realise their value.\r\n- Headcount reduction:  Every 5yrs there is a headcount cull.  Every 10years it is a BIG ONE.  Know that your position within Intel is never \"safe\" or \"secure\".  Times come & go when EVERYONE is watching their back, morale hits rock bottom (company-wide).  At these times management nor senior management seem to know how to raise morale... This results in any effort to allay fears only really resulting in a further exacerbation of the issue as employees are pushed to continue as usual, as if their livelihood isn't at stake (Needless:  This does nothing to improve the situation).\r\n- Near constant efforts to push automation & reduce head count results in greater & greater expectation from employees who are expected to pick up the slack for the roles which have been removed from your organisation (I.e. Lots of people are fired?  The folks remaining are expected to continue the work & responsibilities of those who have been sacked.\r\n- Cashless payment:  This really opened my eyes to how Intel considers it's employees (resources, not people).  I was tasked with assisting in the installation of a cashless payment system (one which is present on a few Intel sites).  These systems do not adhere to any data protection rulings in the UK or EU.  Repeated ethics complaints were submitted & summarily ignored (to varying degrees - Lawyers were involved, but little was done to rectify the situation).  This has (STILL) left Intel employees more open to identity theft & open to people/s with nefarious intent as the security surrounding the cashless payment is still accessible on the internet (accessible by ANYONE) with approaching ZERO security in place to prevent remote access to the personally identifiable details of hundreds (possibly thousands) of totally unwitting people."

No matter how well you perform or how much you sacrifice your time, the company is numb to reward you.\r\n\r\nYou are not a priority in everything small. There is no free food. It's an old company. It doesn't feel grateful for people who work hard for the company's good. And it doesn't really care if you work here and you love to work here. What kills is that there is no dinner when you work after-hours. Hunger and thirst are your best pals. The canteen which you must pay and tastes like hell is closed. Vending machines will be accompanying you. And it's another place you can't owe money.\r\n\r\nYou are also not a priority in everything big. Intel is generally reluctant to pay you. Currently, I'm enjoying my low 10th percent salary of the bay area. I have a near-zero stock grant, no year-end bonus or any rewards that can distinguish my effort from others. But two month ago, I finally had an astounding raise in the salary when my manager ranked my last year as successful. And the raise for the successful was 2.1%. I can't thank the company too much for this, because it even didn't reach the US inflation rate! When my manager presented the number to me. I was startled, utterly speechless and faint to argue. The company that I paid homage to with the faith and worked for with the belief treated me in the way I can only describe as shabby and mean. I've trying to quench my anger, frustration and desperation for 2 months. But I found it's much harder than I thought.\r\n\r\nSoon after my onboarding day, I found the company is filled with people passionless. Now I understand why, because I've become one of them."

It depends on manager discretion and given that commuting is a big issue in Costa Rica, sometimes the flexibility is not the best (not everyone owns a car). In some areas, WFH permissions are very restrictive.\r\n-Work life balance is not constant. Depending on your manager, asking for vacations is like asking for a favor and not a right that you own.

If you have a moron at the top, as an architect, forget about logical work distribution.\r\n- Slow growth at higher levels, you are expected to please everyone to move up, without being a threat to anyone. \r\n- Too much duplication of work across the world. Many business groups and product teams do the same, what COE does, maintaining their codebase in several different places and tools, causing an absolute waste of time for everyone. \r\n\r\nOverall, if you have an appetite for aggressive growth, or you want to contribute big in business/product, you might not find this to be an exact match.

Everybody treat everybody with respect, knowledge is gained and shared. Employees are treated as humans. An Intel employee was very proud to be working there.\r\n\r\nToday, the company is a mess. Projects are getting more and more stressful. Employees focus on taking care of their own interests and the ugly side of office politics rears its head. Now it's only about \"Hire and Fire\"... it's not uncommon to hear about which department or group got closed down, employees getting retrenched, or moved to jobs that they don't care anything about. It's all about survival in Intel now. Gone are the days of making great technologies that will change the world. Unfortunately, many working there are still delusional, everyday hoping that their INTC stock price would go back up to more than USD100++ like the days of old. Oh well... that's not gonna happen... not with the Intel today.\r\n\r\nYou might be hired for a certain job, but don't be surprised if your manager transferred you to a totally different job upon joining. Employees are treated as an item in a spreadsheet instead of valuable talent. Sorry, it's true even though you want to disagree.\r\n\r\nIf you have to chance to go into one of their 'design centres', immediately you'll notice the sombre and depressed mood the employees are in. A certain design centre is famous for its Dungeon Mood which, in my opinion, is counter productive.\r\n\r\nLet's not talk too much on the focal system. I can only describe it in two words = Career Killer."

HR is very deceitful!!!!

Don't waste your time being loyal to Intel only be loyal to yourself and work on self-promotion.   \n\nHard Work is kind of recognized but without the self PR piece is will not be rewarded but later reprimanded.   \n\nFor employees affected in this round of layoffs it sincerely was not due to low performance but more so lack of upper management making incompetent decisions."

		"cons": "The senior managers care only if a task was done or not. They don't go into details and it's hard to explain them about unexpected difficulties that cause delays. The direct managers are effected from this attitude and the pressure is reflected to the employees.\r\n\r\nwe were required to maintain a weekly plan of our work for the following 4-5 months  with estimation of effort for each task. However things were very dynamic and it's hard to know in advance how much time each task will span. Moreover it's hard to have estimation when you don't know the task in details yet.\r\n\r\nThe Weekly Status Updates should been sent to the whole division (~45 people) although many employees have nothing to do with my work in weekly resolution (and the vice versa- i don't have any interest with getting so much weekly updates). It caused unnecessary tension because some employees \"pumped up\" their weekly status and made it look like the others achieve much less.\r\n\r\nWhen someone worked from home/ had to leave early / had to come late/ took day off- then it was customary to send notice to the whole division (again, most of the 45 people are not affected with my work)\r\n\r\nThere are many meetings that just waste time.  For each problem managers set a meeting and expect to hear easy solutions, they don't get responsibility to their decisions that create the problems from the first place.\r\n\r\nPersonally i worked many hours to get over the mess created by the methodology of work that was decided by the managers. I didn't feel to get respect for it and it  didn't affected managers to accept my suggestions to change this methodology.\r\n\r\nNo need to mention that the \"birthday vacation\" and the \"7 year sabbatical\" are only gimmicks"

		"pros": "Intel offers fairly decent compensation and benefits, including quarterly bonuses that occur throughout the year.\r\n\r\nAdmins are generally nice, friendly people that host (somewhat) enjoyable workplace events. These events are good for getting to know other employees, and for being a pleasant distraction from the stress of day-to-day work life.\r\n\r\nIntel has an \u201cOpen Door Policy\u201d and \u201cNo Retaliation Policy\u201d which should work in theory, except for the fact that managers don't really follow these policies. Managers run their own culture within their own teams, ethical or not.\r\n\r\nIf you're really, really lucky, you MIGHT get to work on a diverse team with friendly people that know how to collaborate in a positive manner.",
		"cons": "Reading all these ridiculous, overwhelmingly positive, one-liner reviews of Intel, a company that conducts itself like a soulless, unsympathetic dictatorial power, makes me sick to my stomach. You can't just look the other way and pretend not to notice the ethical violations of this company, simply because they are handing you a paycheck every two weeks. Get real.\r\n\r\nIntel is a company that maintains an unbelievably negative and dysfunctional work environment. Incompetent, lower-level managers consistently foster a negative and toxic environment of finger-pointing and blame. There is literally no teamwork or camaraderie, and you will consistently be blamed for falling short on certain assignments, regardless of whether or not you had the proper resources, documentation, or support to do your job at a high level. You might get paid relatively well, but it won't exactly be a \u201cGreat Place to Work,\u201d as Intel\u2019s clownish managers consistently claim that it is.\r\n\r\nLet me paraphrase to you some of the Lync messenger interactions I had with my manager on a regular basis:\r\n\r\n\u201cHi <employee>, looking for update here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHi <employee>, looking for update\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHello <employee>...I'm looking for an update here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHi <employee>...looking for update here...where is the update\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHi <employee>\u2026when can I expect an update\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is wrong with you? Drop what you\u2019re doing and give me update.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatever else you are working on\u2026CAN\u2019T THAT WAIT?!\u201d\r\n\r\nYou get the idea. Seriously, people, I\u2019m not even exaggerating here.\r\n\r\nYour manager won't even have the courtesy to ask whether you are stuck or struggling on any part of the project, and whether or not you need help from other designers or engineers. He or she might even \u201cyell\u201d at you through the Lync messenger, which is quite intimidating, isn\u2019t it? Everything is mostly just \u201cHi, looking for update here...\u201d What a rude and insensitive message to receive from your manager on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nWhat are we now, emotionless robots? Go figure.\r\n\r\nIn order to get ahead at Intel, you need to utilize the \u201cbuddy\u201d system to extreme effect and somehow become \u201cbuddy buddy\u201d with your manager. Otherwise, simply producing high-quality work will not be nearly enough to get you a promotion. Extreme politics are in effect at all times with this corporation.\r\n\r\nManagers will probably not care at all about work-life balance, and will expect employees to be slaves \u2013 even on the weekends. Managers mostly give off a negative and threatening vibe which make employees feel uncomfortable much of the time.\r\n\r\nIntel has virtually no quality control over the people they select for managerial positions. Most of its managers have pathetic leadership skills and are completely lacking in basic emotional intelligence. Moreover, managers use fear and intimidation tactics on a consistent basis to manipulate and control employees. Believe me, it's not even remotely fun to be on the receiving end of that type of treatment. When a dictatorial manager treats you as if he or she \u201cowns\u201d you, then you know this isn't a particularly \u201cGreat Place to Work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat Place to Work.\u201d What a joke.\r\n\r\nIntel prides itself on diversity \u2013 yet, arguably, over 80% of the people at the company are Indian. When you step foot inside the SC12 cafeteria at their Santa Clara location, you literally feel like you are in India. Is this really diversity?\r\n\r\nDiversity doesn\u2019t mean having an overwhelming majority of people from one race/ethnicity/nationality that is DIFFERENT from Americans. Diversity means DIVERSITY \u2013 having a wide spectrum of people across ALL different races/ethnicities/nationalities. Last time I checked, having over 80% of the people working at your company from India is just like INDIA. Give me a break.\r\n\r\nBy the way \u2013 if you are an electrical engineer and fail to heed my advice by accepting a job offer at this trashy company \u2013 please BEWARE of the group MEM-IP (memory IP).\r\n\r\nSTAY AWAY FROM MEM-IP.\r\n\r\nThis is a junk group, which totally epitomizes the dysfunctional work environment at Intel. If you are a hardware engineer and enjoy working on memory technology, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GROUP. You will be sorely disappointed if they somehow trick you into joining their terrible team, which they unfortunately did with me. \r\n\r\nMEM-IP maintains a poisonous environment of finger-pointing and blame, and there is virtually no teamwork or camaraderie within this group. It\u2019s an absolutely terrible place to start off as a recent college graduate (RCG) trying to begin a career in hardware engineering. You will learn very little, since the documentation for all circuit designs are extremely poor and haphazardly written. It\u2019s almost as if circuit documents were written by a slacker in high school who doesn\u2019t even know proper English. Internal documentation and resources for this group are absolutely atrocious. \r\n\r\nMostly, you will be on your own, and will have to bear the brunt of the blame for all issues on your projects, even if management never puts you in a position to succeed. This group operates on a very selfish, \u201cevery man for himself\u201d basis. More experienced engineers (when not extremely busy dealing with their own problems) will oftentimes guide you in the wrong direction because they themselves won\u2019t be familiar with a particular design or simulation that you\u2019re working on. And \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 YOU will be blamed by management for going in the wrong direction on that particular project.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t even get me started on meetings \u2013 almost every meeting I was a part of in MEM-IP was essentially a forum for finger-pointing, blaming, and chewing out employees that made mistakes in the execution of their projects. In theory, a meeting should be for employees to work together in a friendly and collaborative manner to make progress and resolve issues. The reality is that meetings \u2013 whether in-person or online \u2013 are very poorly conducted at Intel, and a complete waste of time. Essentially, unethical supervisors or project managers take the reins in meetings and nitpick nonsensical issues, while blowing them completely out of proportion in order to identify so-called \u201cunderperforming\u201d members of the group. In meetings, people are regularly treated like crap for making honest mistakes. This is not my idea of a productive or collaborative meeting \u2013 this is a joke.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Intel as a business hasn\u2019t been particularly successful in recent years. PC sales are dwindling by the second, and being 10 years late to the mobile industry is an extremely poor reflection on management\u2019s performance in recent years \u2013 and we\u2019re not even talking about workplace environment or ethical issues over here. This is pure business.\r\n\r\nIntel is a joke.\r\n\r\nIntel is so much of a joke that it conducts itself like a university classroom. Do you know how employee performance is rated at Intel? Using a primitive bell-curve system \u2013 just like those used in university engineering courses.\r\n\r\nAre you kidding me? You rate employees on a bell-curve? What kind of archaic performance evaluation system is this? Are we taking Electromagnetics 101 at UCLA, or something? Give me a freaking break. Intel\u2019s entire performance evaluation system is predicated on constantly weeding out certain members of the workforce who don\u2019t live up to ridiculous and unrealistic expectations.\r\n\r\nThis means that if you work your butt off 12 hours a day, yet 95% of the other employees in your group are working 14 hours a day, you\u2019re screwed. You WILL be targeted \u2013 and ultimately fired. As simple as that. Remember, Intel\u2019s human resources (HR) department needs to maintain its unique quotas \u2013 no matter how valuable of an employee you might be. You may have the very best of intentions, but you will be treated like dirt all the way through \u2013 especially when they walk you out of that door for the very last time.\r\n\r\nIntel uses an archaic and unethical tool called a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) to target, isolate, and alienate those employees that they want to get rid of \u2013 regardless of whether they had performance issues or not. This is equivalent to putting a person in \u201cjail\u201d at work \u2013 an incredibly insulting, humiliating, dehumanizing, and demoralizing device which, again, targets and alienates certain employees that management doesn\u2019t like. This means that you had better be a goody two-shoes and never complain or speak out against incompetent managers/leaders \u2013 otherwise, most likely, you WILL be put on a CAP. Furthermore, managers will blatantly lie and provide false statements on a CAP document, just to make it seem like you had performance issues. You could be put on a CAP even if you were intentionally set up to fail. Are the vindictive managers at Intel really such cruel, cold-hearted people who are completely lacking in even a basic conscience? So much so that they would blatantly lie in order to cover up their own incompetence, and get rid of employees whom they perceive to be a threat to their own power? You\u2019d better believe it.\r\n\r\nIntel supposedly has an \u201cOpen Door Policy\u201d and a \u201cNo Retaliation Policy\u201d which seem to indicate that you can raise any concerns or issues with management, without worrying about retaliation against you. However, these policies are a complete joke and are just a smokescreen created by HR to lure unsuspecting employees into thinking they are safe from any retaliation by their manager. If you raise concerns about workplace issues, you will ABSOLUTELY be targeted and retaliated against. The \u201cOpen Door Policy\u201d and \u201cNo Retaliation Policy\u201d are complete BS. If they really were legitimate, why do you think the company still utilizes these insane, prehistoric CAPs?\r\n\r\nAgain, I emphasize, Intel really is a joke \u2013 both in the running of its business and its poor workplace environment. If you\u2019re an electrical engineer and you think that getting a job at Intel is somehow a dream scenario \u2013 think again. You will be highly disappointed when you go behind the scenes and see exactly how this messy, haphazard company operates. Don\u2019t blindly follow its recent ad campaign with Jim Parsons, star of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d and somehow get the wrong impression that Intel is some likable corporation. Remember, Jim Parsons doesn\u2019t work AT Intel \u2013 he only ACTS for its silly commercials.\r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and take your talents to any one of the other multitude of Silicon Valley companies that are not only on a positive growth trajectory, but also treat their employees with some semblance of decency, respect, and professionalism. Sure, there will always be some unpleasant managers and employees at any company, but these types of people are unfortunately WIDELY prevalent at Intel. And believe me, CEO Brian Krzanich isn\u2019t running down from his office on the 5th floor of the RNB building to tackle any ethical issues at the lower levels. He quite simply doesn\u2019t care \u2013 and has more \u201cimportant\u201d things to worry about, anyways \u2013 such as the state of his struggling business.\r\n\r\nSure, you might end up getting lucky and join a good, respectable group at Intel \u2013 of which there certainly are a few \u2013 but do you really want to take that chance when there are much better companies out there?\r\n\r\nIn summary \u2013 steer clear of Intel. This is an unethical and toxic corporation that runs on nothing but the \u201cbuddy\u201d system and extreme workplace politics. Intel is simply not the place to cultivate a lengthy, rewarding, or enjoyable engineering career."

		"duration": "N/A",
		"pros": "Lots of advanced technology, some very intelligent peers, immediate team member's culture can be hit or miss, but mine have been great. You can easily move within the company into different products or disciplines. There is a fairly professional culture vibe (depends on team) that promotes a safe working environment (which is great) but is also very bland (cubes, grey walls, very poor celebrations).",
		"cons": "Focal (the review process) creates a horrible culture by deliberately suppressing employees careers and wages. It creates a artificially limited resource (promotion budget) that encourages people to game the system by doing only what gets them promoted and not what helps their teams, their product, or the company. Promotions and raises are typically not a problem for more junior developers, but there is an extreme plateau for senior developers where advancement is not truly a meritocracy but more luck and opportunity based. I should also note that while the pay is decent for a tech company, it is extremely lacking for a top-tier tech company. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Nvidia and others pay significantly more; and the CEO practically brags about about getting a good deal by short changing the employees (they deliberately aim to be average pay, and have no intent of being above average).\r\n\r\nThere is also an extreme divide between engineering and non-engineering disciplines with different standards, expectations, and perceived value. Cross discipline skillsets are absolutely not rewarded or recognized despite being desperately needed. This exacerbates the big company problems of management hierarchy, political games, and poor decision making. \r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, the current CEO Brian Krzanich is devastatingly bad for the employees of the company. Between his awful oversight of the layoffs in 2016, blaming first level managers for his own poor decisions and intentionally deceiving the employees in every single corporate meeting (like praising himself for giving back to employees due to the recent major tax savings, while hiding the fact he simultaneously removed bonuses that were worth more than the tax bonus), Intel has been hemorrhaging brain power. Unfortunately his actions have short term stock benefits despite the long term decimation of company culture and morale; it is unlikely he will be removed from his position by the board. \r\n\r\nI've been at the company 10 years, and it has been going strictly downhill for the last ~5-6. I've lost all my trust and allegiance to the company, and the only thing that keeps me there is the personal connection to my team.\r\n\r\n\r\nBonus Con: The IT, corporate services, and hiring departments deserve their own special place in hell."

		"pros": "1) The company is so large that changing careers while staying at Intel isn't all the difficult. It's hard to get bored here but easy to move around if you do.  There are always new challenges to be addressed, some new and some that have been around for years. If you want to excel the opportunities are endless for a self-starter.  \r\n\r\n2) Work/life balance has been pretty great for the most part. I've done my share of late nights and weekends, but I've also always had the flexibility to take a last minute day off. Or to leave for a couple hours in the day for an appointment without having to get approval to do so. It's a give/take situation. If you need to be out you're trusted to find coverage and to do what is needed to get your work done. I don't feel like my movements are dictated, and that is super important to me.",
		"cons": "1) Like I said, there are always problems to be fixed - locally and those that are globally impactful. I don't think management does a good enough job identifying those people who have given up on trying to solve the big problems - essentially the dead weight of the company.  I have come across so many people who have told me they can't be bothered to fight for certain improvements, or that they have given up trying. These people have gone into 'coast' mode.  We're supposed to be the best of the best, but management doesn't always manage their people the right way to ensure that is the case. \r\n\r\n2) My relationship with my direct managers has always been a trustworthy and respectful one. But if you go one or two levels up that trust degrades considerably. There is a lot of 'management speak' that doesn't feel genuine, and decisions are made without transparency which causes distress amongst employees. Rumors are not quickly dispelled, and overall it feels upper management just does not have the right connection or 'finger on the pulse' when it comes to their employees/individual contributors. \r\n\r\n3) As an employee I sometimes feel like I don't know where Intel is going as a company.  We get our hands into so many things - new areas and saturated markets. It's hard to keep track of what is most important at any given time."

		"duration": "N/A",
		"pros": "Learned the basics  of designing and testing high quality CPU's. These skills are invaluable, and believe it or not, not all CPU companies have mastered these basics, and is what I think makes Intel  CPU's dominant in their respective markets.\r\n\r\nFrom 1997 to when I left, had a lot of opportunities make my own mark. Unfortunately, because of the cons, the XScale business was jettisoned and before I left I was absorbed into the x86 part of the business which was different.\r\n\r\nI did get promoted twice, and I'm a minority. However, I did work like the dickens for it, and never did make it to the the Staff level, which at the time seems to be the point at which you were taken seriously at Intel.\r\n\r\nBack in the 1990's the stock options and bonuses were grea. After 2000, they became worthless.  Intel has sinced switched over to RSU's, which are a surer thing, though with less upside.  I don't see Intel as the rip-roaring growth company so I think this was a good move to keep people satisfied.  Intel put about 12% of your pay into your 401K (SERP). It was reduced to 8% when I left. Still a great benefit\r\n\r\nBase salary was below average. During hard times we skipped FOCAL raises. Before I left",
		"cons": "For the first 3-4 years I was there, I worked on average 10 hours a day. For a first generation new product I worked about 13-15 hours a day for 5 months straight, as did about 5 others. The one manager who did that with his underling no longer works for the company. Not only was he smart but was a good leader.  A loss for Intel, IMHO.\r\n\r\nCulture is different from one group to the next and changed over time.  Intel's culture is based on Andy Grove's management style.  Confrontational (constructive), and aggressive.  Intel thinks itself egalitarian, but over time has become less so. Now, a  level 3 engineer confronting a staff engineer (level 8) is a very dangerous thing, even if the level 3 engineer is right--which is not an impossibility. Ever hear of a Pyrrhic victory?\r\n\r\nThe FOCAL process is not uniform, and can be overly harsh. I transfered to a department that wanted to promote me based on my prior FOCAL but couldn't because my former manager refused to recommend me for a promotion--probably sour grapes despite my documented performance but there was nothing that could be done.  I was given an unsatisfactory review (and this after being promoted to level 7) because I reported a staff engineer (level 8) who was upset that I reported him for verbally dressing me down on Microsoft Communicator ( internet chat). Imagine that: he sent me nice little barbs over the 'net and acts surprised that I didn't report him.  My manager was given a bad review, too, when he confronted (constructively) him regarding this issue. This guy must have had major pull (remember my egalitarian statement?)\r\n\r\nIntel is known as a great place to work in the Asian community, and I hear Asians really help each other out there and have a much better experience than other groups. This is from first hand knowledge talking with Asian engineers working in the same difficult groups I worked in, and calling them great with lots of support from peers.\r\n\r\nEngineers can't get along, and clique up pretty hard. I think some strategic moves made by Intel flamed out partly because of cliques that could not get along, and the unfortunate folks caught in cross fire.\r\n\r\nMy advice. Get in. Learn the basics. Get a promotion to verify you know the basics. Then find a gig at a smaller company or statup where people are real. Intel is a great place to have worked. I say you should see a promotion in 3 years, else you're doing something wrong, or being put on the list to be CAP'ed out."

Most tasks consisted of pressing a button and waiting for the software to finish the test. I worked twelve hour shifts and for the most part worked by myself in isolation in the fab. I didn't feel that there was a team mentality but rather everyone operated as individuals. \r\nI was amazed at the level of incompetence of some of my fellow technicians. Some have been working there for 20 plus years but have no grasp upon current technology. The only thing that saves them is that the tasks are so amazingly simple. \r\nAttempting to shift from a technician to an engineer was very difficult. I am a senior in computer science at ASU and because my section didn't require a computer scientist, they were not interested in helping me achieve my degree even though there were hundreds of openings for computer science graduates throughout the company. It is an odd culture that is focused on output and not so much about the quality of its people.\r\nAs far as management, I had some really great managers and some really bad managers. I rarely had a manager for more than a year which meant constantly having to adjust to a new management style and new personality. It becomes tedious after awhile. Also there are just too many managers who are terrible people persons. My last manager was just so aggravating and unwilling to work with my degree pursuit that I left Intel after eight years in order to focus on my degree."

It is important to do things that are visible to your manager so you are recognized. In most cases these don't contribute to real value. For instance speaking up in meetings even if you have nothing useful to say will get you a lot of recognition from short sighted managers. They also have way too many managers who do not get involved in the day to day work of the employee but still reserve the right to judge their performance independent of peer reviews. \r\n\r\nThe culture is also shifting away from the core values under BK. The upper management stealthily tries to remove good people under the garb of performance management. People rated successful are being terminated because they landed on the wrong side of the successful scale (based on a manager's rating, which could be biased). Risk taking and innovation are not being rewarded. The only thing that matters is that you fall in line and impress your manager. \r\n\r\nThe overall company direction under BK also does not make sense. There is a lot of marketing fluff  with the diversity hiring. On the one hand they lay-off successful experienced employees and on the other hand they want to lower the bar for entry with diversity only reqs (a $300M fund for diversity hiring). Positions that have diversity hires will be funded by HR for over a year."

Even when they hired certain VP's by paying 25M+ for them to come in and whip engineerings butt in shape, still nothing has changed.  The VP's talk the talk and say how we are revamping our core of engineering, but in the end, they bend over for the shareholders and will ride this money wave out until they're obligation is up and then bounce out.  At engineering updates they are giving us EPS (Earnings per share) numbers and how project bla is going to make us money.  \r\nThe pay is pretty mediocre.   RSU's are grim.  you won't break 10k over 4 for a quite a few years.  Stock purchase is okay, capped at 5% base income.  CEO always says \"we pay fair, and in the middle of the range\" or something along those lines.  What that translates to is that we hire average to below average talent, meaning potentially myself included.  \r\nThe company is in a cycle of hiring and then s/firing/head count reduction/g before quarter close to drive stock price up.   then re-hiring. \r\nOverall, employee moral is pretty damn low.

How much did you learn by doing that? You should have learned that it is costing Intel huge every hour that tool is not producing, and whether you get to actually troubleshoot it to find a defective module or circuit card is irrelevant to Intel. This is known in the industry and former Intel techs have had to face this perception (that they can\u2019t really troubleshoot) when job hunting after Intel."

I don't know what the other employees are smoking that said the work life balance here is bad, that's wrong.  The reason so many people just coast on through working here is because the work life balance is great.  You see the same people coming in, doing their 9 to 5, taking hour + lunches with mutliple breaks for 15 to 20 or 30 minutes, leave early to pick up the kids etc.   If you want to start a family and be around for the kids growing up, come on over!  If you're younger and looking for a competitive work environment, look elsewhere.",
		"cons": "The leadership here is completely lost.  Engineering tools, flows, methodologies are incredibly out dated in many teams and orgs.  Projects are guided by share holders and investors and not innovation.  They say they thrive on innovation, but when you and you're colleagues make suggestions on ways to improve TTM (Time to market) for projects, new methodologies that the rest of industry is using, improved work flows, etc, and they keep saying that we cannot support such things or that we don't have time to make those changes without affecting project timelines, that's a clear indication that they way they work here is not changing anytime soon.  Even when they hired certain VP's by paying 25M+ for them to come in and whip engineerings butt in shape, still nothing has changed.  The VP's talk the talk and say how we are revamping our core of engineering, but in the end, they bend over for the shareholders and will ride this money wave out until they're obligation is up and then bounce out.  At engineering updates they are giving us EPS (Earnings per share) numbers and how project bla is going to make us money.  \r\nThe pay is pretty mediocre.   RSU's are grim.  you won't break 10k over 4 for a quite a few years.  Stock purchase is okay, capped at 5% base income.  CEO always says \"we pay fair, and in the middle of the range\" or something along those lines.  What that translates to is that we hire average to below average talent, meaning potentially myself included.  \r\nThe company is in a cycle of hiring and then s/firing/head count reduction/g before quarter close to drive stock price up.   then re-hiring. \r\nOverall, employee moral is pretty damn low.  A lot of people are interviewing, or looking else-where, myself included.  The coasters of the company are completely happy."

Intel expects that employees own their career and make career and skills choices that would lead to advancement, if that is what they want.",
		"cons": "Because Intel has the policy of generally paying \"above market average\" this has the effect of retaining employees who are aware that they are overpaid and not attracting the employees who could (and should) be making WAY above market average.  \r\n\r\nThere have been, over the years, numerous \"redeployments\" where employees are asked to find another job internally or leave (within 3 months, normally)  this has resulted in the attrition of about 20000 employees over the last few years.  So, naturally, people are worried about their own job security.  Intel has also redeployed groups only to hire their replacements in cheaper geographies.  I have had the opportunity to train my replacement in India - that was fun.  \r\n\r\nThe benefits have been cut over the last few years.  Intel has cut the amount contributed to 401K programs from 10 to 7 percent and they have also modified, on more than one occasion, the formula by which bonuses are calculated (modified so that the bonuses became smaller, of course).  \r\n\r\nIntel does not provide state of the art laptops or desktops for its employees, which is baffling for a technology company.  Typically the hardware given to employees is a generation or two behind the fastest available on the market. \r\n\r\nOh, and one last thing, the cafeteria food is less than satisfactory."

		"duration": "N/A",
		"pros": "As an intern, the pay at Intel simply can't be beat.  In fact, it is very nearly what a newly-hired full-time engineer would be paid.  There are also several non-wage benefits, including relocation reimbursement, cash bonuses, stock options, and medical and dental insurance.  All of these great benefits are even available to interns!  Also, there were several paid days of Intern Outings, where all of the interns would go out to get ice cream and hang out at a park, or something like that.\r\n\r\nBesides the pay, the culture at Intel is great.  People are friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help.\r\nThe small working groups really help to make a large corporation like Intel still maintain the intimate feel of a small company.  Small groups are able to get things done more easily, with less interruption from the chain of command.\r\nAlthough the working groups have the feel of a small company, it is great to be able to leverage the resources of a large company like Intel.  With a strong focus on ergonomics and safety in and out of the office, Intel leads by example in providing its employees with the safest and most comfortable working environment possible.\r\nWith a great variety of special interest groups, Intel is a great place to keep up-to-date with new technologies, or just refresh your memory of things you once knew.",
		"cons": "Working in Hudson, MA, I was somewhat disconnected with the corporate offices on the west coast.  I have heard it said that the closer one gets to the corporate offices, the harder it is to get useful work done without interruption.\r\n\r\nFor interns on short work terms, like three-month rotations, the employee cash bonus program does not work well, since the amount paid is based on the number of work weeks since the most recent hire date.  This nullifies any weeks in the previous work term that were not already paid a bonus, since there was a termination in between.\r\n\r\nIn the Hudson location, there is some growing pain in the area of converging on a common tool chain.  I imagine that this is an artifact of the several acquisitions that have taken place over the years at this facility."

Some times it is difficult for the management know what their employees are doing on a regular basis because they are pulled in many directions. This requires the employee to focus on perception rather than the actually job. I felt like I was simply a number rather than a valued contributor to the company even though I have made significant contributions and  have saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars (not much for intel as a whole but justified my salary over 5-6 times over. Having one \"Needs Improvement\"  or \"Successful with no stocks\" rating during the annually review can result in a layoff 3-4 years down the road even though you have worked extremely hard to improve and become very successful and valuable member of the team. This does not layoff is not about saving money for Intel but the new CEO will regularly remove \"low performers\" to please stock holders. Extremely stressful because goals are always changing (but this is in the same in all semiconductor companies). The new CEO is very very focused on metrics on every level and ways that seem ridiculous to others from the outside. I was reprimanded for not meeting the quota for documenting minor safety caches i.e. I saw a person walk down the stairs without holding the hand rail and didn't document it. This is the level of detail of how Intel values metrics."

You are no longer allowed to work from home unless you have a good reason and you are expected to be physically present at least standard work hours.\r\n\r\n-- There is a lot of hypocrisy here. There are \"Great Place to Work\" events that appear to be geared towards the employees that are not worked as hard.\r\n            - Upper management throws around the term \"great place to work\", but the extra events / team builders / dinners seem forced and just to save face.  They are for all employees (technicians and less technical staff also) not just for those that they are likely designed for to offset the long hours.  There is nothing extra for those that work crazy hours.  \r\n\r\n            - The \"Great Place to Work\" events come with a cost. If there is a deadline coming up or the Fab is waiting on you, your work still needs to get done, so you may get free food or a free movie, but will have to work late because your work is still there."

I felt we were more as a team as we were able to interact with other teams better working on the same project.\r\n\r\nStarting pay, RSUs and raises were once good like 5%, but ever since moving grade levels, noticed the raises were not as good. I got higher pay increases when I started off at a lower level than higher unless promoted.",
		"cons": "I am ranking these as I see fit.  \r\n\r\n1. Under BK as our CEO things have gone really bad like our benefits. We are making record revenues and profits every year, but somehow our money is not going back to the employees.  Our raises keep on getting worst every year and for RSUs, it keeps on getting worst value wise. I remember getting promoted from grade 5 to 6, 5 years ago and I got SSL2 stock worth $11K value.  When I got from grade 6 to grade 7 promotion my manager was only able to give me SSL3 stock worth only 7.5K.    Then, our 401K for retirement has not been reinstated back to 6%.  Our quarterlies funding drops as well, as we do not have anymore winter parties and are replaced with snag a snack day.  \r\n\r\nManagement always talks about cost cutting, but they seem to make some big acquisitions and spend a lot of money  on external executive hires and a lot of diversity propaganda.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of senior leaders that left the company that would have made a fine CEO in the future.  \r\n\r\n2. Go through many managers, (1 manager per 1 year) \r\n\r\n3. Working with other cross sites in way different time zones. Europe and Asia, always trying to find the right time to fit into our schedules. Sometimes we need to have meetings either late or early.\r\n\r\n4. Lots of reorgs, we go through once a year now.  I do not see the point why other than it creates a new position for someone wanting to be promoted\r\n\r\n5. Working on projects, we tend to work within our own team instead all different teams working together to solve problems.  \r\n\r\n6.  Lots of meetings that are sometimes pointless, find out which ones are important to attend. I tend to skip some because they are not relevant to me.\r\n\r\n7. Lots of Intel senior management that stayed within Intel for many years have left or \"retired\" during BK tenure and most of the upper staff tend to be folks we paid a great deal of money to hire on the outside.  They tend always want to focus on cost cutting instead of improving morale and culture."

Many of them express sadness that CR did not make an effort to retain them. This makes others want to leave (well that is how people work these days). \r\n\r\nIf you do not value them while they are here, they will not stay. The message we hear often is that we can replace you. I think it is up to the leaders to introspect if they are indeed replacing the talent that went away (or planning to leave).\r\n\r\nSeveral engineers complained that the messages they hear from leaders is confusing. If you fail to retain the key contributors , we will face a gradual decline in the ideas and quality of work. We will also have hard time to recruit (since the engineers will not refer someone knowing the state of affairs).\r\n\r\nBe proactive in retaining talent. If the engineers who push the ideas leave , we will have a serious issue. Decades ago, one could treat the retention with a power play, there is serious competition for talent today.\r\n\r\nABUSIVE POWER PLAY: Some of the leaders operate by power play, blocking access/stopping support/questioning essential expenditures/approval for literature to exert control over the engineers. This is abusive to say the least. The practice of punishing/abusive the engineers who have a difference in opinion  or plan, idea or ambition is hurtful. \r\n\r\nWe are surprised that in the world of #metoo, why Intel does not train the leaders to stop using their power play tactics. It may mean the difference between a retained employee and one that leaves. Use knowledge and logic instead of power play culture. \r\n\r\nI am ashamed to even share this with my colleagues at other companies how CR/TMG treats their employees."

One great example was when my division (which supported construction groups all over the planet) suddenly had telecommuting banned for all employees.  Within a month or two all of the women in my group somehow miraculously got \"exceptions\" to the telecommuting ban, while the two men in my group (myself included) did not.\r\n\r\nAlso, Intel is largely run by folks in their mid 50's.  Although the internal groupings of the company seem to be in a constant state of flux, the true corporate management structure changes little, with the same small group of people holding relatively identical positions of power regardless of their changes in job title.

Most of my friends who've left have lost their higher paying positions at other corporations after a couple of years.  \r\n\r\nThat said, the work is challenging (at least in my area) and rewarding in a karma sort of way since you realize that many people around the world will use what you work on.  The people are all very bright, and I mostly enjoy working with my team a lot.  Things get DONE at Intel and done on time (mostly), because when they aren't, the world notices.",
		"cons": "Work / life balance depends totally on what group you work in.  Some groups are very liberal (Marketing, etc), but many groups are run by old timers who absolutely do not believe in ever 'working from home', and in some cases even closely track who gets to work at 8am and who doesn't.  Corporate is absolutely WORTHLESS in standardizing this and gives lip service to 'employee work/life balance' that means NOTHING.  In anycase, expect to work 50 hours a week at MINIMUM.\r\n\r\nThe ranking and rating/focal process is horrific and brutal.  It takes up about 4 months a year when you include normal focal and mid-year focal and the results don't justify it.  It DOES make the place a dog-eat-dog killer of a place to work, where you are never really sure you will not get rated low unless you are doing your best, but the paranoia it inspires and the pain is unneeded and unnecessary.  \r\n\r\nUpper management is very, very smart, and I am impressed by their ethics.  However, they are ruthlessly brutal and some of them will not hesitate to blackball you or run you out of the company if you cross them or fail to kowtow.\r\n\r\nBiggest downside for the average employee is that Intel, despite being a 'high tech' company gives it's employees absolutely CRAP computers to work on.  4 or 5 year old laptops are the norm unless you are doing silicon design or something that requires something newer.  When my monitor died a year ago I was given a new CRT monitor that I later found on Newegg for $60 and that I wouldn't have bought  even for use at my house, and which of course died after only a few months.  This sort of pennywise, poundfoolish idiocy abounds, except in the silicon fabs, where spending $100M on a new stepper is considered just the cost of doing business (which it is, but come on, so are decent computers for the engineers).\r\n\r\nAnother downside is that despite being insanely profitable constantly, management constantly looks for more ways to keep this money from the rank and file.  Profit sharing used to be 12.5% of salary when I started, then it went to 8%, now is at 7% and they are clearly positioning it to go even lower.  Health benefits are similarly being reduced.\r\n\r\nLast but not least there has been a strong 'diversity' push in the last few years, which would normally be great, but which has resulted in significant bias during focal and hiring AGAINST people who are not 'diverse'."

		"cons": "Intel always pays below the market average.  Benefits are good.  However, the senior management's inability to stay ahead of the curve in the mobility market has led to a stagnation of the stock price which is a big part of the compensation package.  \r\n\r\nEmployees are rated on a bell curve system called ranking and rating.  This means someone is always left holding the hot potato.  Instead of motivating employees to do better this has led to a back biting environment where the deceitful employees often are rewarded.  Those employees who can do \"do\".  Those who can't will lie.  Unfortunately the management structure at Intel requires even 1st level supervisors to be in meetings and to crunch numbers most of the time and this creates a disconnect between the workers and  those who should observing them closely.  The solution is for the workers to submit a \"weekly\" report of their activities.  This is where the deceit comes in.  Under-achieving workers simply fluff their report or outright lie about their activities.  They are often rewarded simply because they focus most of their efforts on producing weeklys that make them look good."

Our campus had a nice commissary (though I think they will slowly kill all the employees with the giant portion sizes)  and you rarely wanted to go out to lunch.  \r\n\r\nIf you are in the right job, it's a GREAT job.  If you have an opportunity to look here, you SHOULD look into it.\r\n\r\nI do honestly got the feeling the company actually CARED about us.. well not on an individual basis... that would be ridiculous... but as a collective.   I really cannot say that about many companies, and if it weren't for the downsides of my job, it would have pained me to leave.",
		"cons": "Cons are always wordier:  human nature.\r\n\r\nThere were many cons for me, and unfortunately they eventually outweighed the pros.  Again, if you are looking for a job at Intel, I wouldn't discourage you from looking.  Just be aware when you get there it has the same kinds of problems ALL big companies have.  One in particular stands out:  Meetings, meetings, meetings and more meetings.  And usually meetings that waste a lot of time; the culture has a greater emphasis on social correctness and five minutes of \"chit-chat\" than it does work, and I do have an issue with that.  Particularly when you spend a good hour on a meeting that can get done in 20 minutes.  \r\n\r\nI also worked some ungodly hours on some issues for customers who decided a month or two later \"Oh, you fixed that?  It really wasn't that important.\"  And unless you are a social butterfly (I'm not) finding a new job isn't that easy.  \r\n\r\nI think your job at Intel is going to only be as successful as your team's collective desire and ability to win.  People are generally risk-averse and like job security.  It pained me to watch the young interns sitting next to me love their jobs and do so well on their team, while mine settled for mediocrity and my own mind started to stagnate because it was being stressed without being appropriately challenged.   I worked with good people who were discouraged and felt powerless, and I was turning into one of them. Once I recognized this, I waited for the right opportunity to leave and did so.\r\n\r\nYour manager can change in the blink of an eye.  This can be useful, but it's not great for relationship-building/team-building.\r\n\r\nNot everyone is always promoted from within.  Managers are more concerned with how they look when promoting someone, as opposed to promoting the people who can do the job.  \r\n\r\nBut in the end... it's the stress of the job that'll do you in, combined with the ridiculous rating system.   It's too easy to get a \"Meets Expectations\" regardless of whether you are working your tail off and achieving, or slacking because you've been there too long and are burned out, and need a BETTER challenge."

		"cons": "Management can be kind of a top-down dictatorship, at least in the manufacturing division.  \r\n\r\nTelecommuting for the sake of telecommuting (general work/life balance) is not permitted in TMG. You can only telecommute in cases like a sick child, plumber coming out to the house, brief personal medical situation or illness, etc. Some TMG groups that are more distant from the manufacturing line still allow the old policy of one telecommute day per week (in violation of the policy), so you may have it better if you're in one of those. The current policy is probably better than some other companies, but Intel TMG's ban on telecommute is recent (within the past few years) and it a step backwards compared to other forward-thinking companies that are embracing employee flexibility.\r\n\r\nAlong with the new office design has come a tops-down mandate in many orgs where people no longer have their own desks. Depends on which division you are in, but you many not have any space to keep personal belongings at work -- no locker, let alone a desk.  \r\n\r\nHigh expectations and high stress for employees who are tied to the manufacturing line (fabs, assembly/test), and groups are always understaffed.  More work to be done than a group could do even if it doubled its headcount. On-call is common, and for some people can be 24/7, 365.\r\n\r\nIntel has a large manufacturing presence in the U.S. compared to many other companies that have entirely moved manufacturing overseas. This fact is held over Intel employee's heads, e.g. \"you better meet these impossible expectations no matter what cost to your personal health, or else ...remember, we are competing with Asian wages.\"\r\n\r\nIntel completely missed the boat in getting into mobile devices/ iPhones. Company outlook will always be questionable because of that.\r\n\r\nThere isn't really an \"internal transfer\" process if you want to move to the same job role in a different state. Any time you change departments, it is an interview process. \r\n\r\nMany managers have just gone up the ladder from engineer to group leader - some managers are good, but for many, technical aptitude does not predict that someone will have aptitude at managing and developing people."

		"pros": "Competitive environment focused on performance metrics:  Generally the high level CSI (Critical Success Indicators) are well chosen and focus on the business outcomes so teams are focused on the \"corporate good\".  This is critical to keep the large teams (100's to 1000's of employees) targeting their attention on what needs work (yield, cost, cycle time, product development cycles, employee satisfaction, safety).  You know what to focus on to affect your bonus.  The HR policies/standards are generally good and are not influenced by the \"flavor of the month\" trap that smaller or dysfunctional corporations can fall under.",
		"cons": "Competitive environment focused on performance metrics:  At a lower layer, the mantra of \"what get's measured gets done\" can lead to excessive measures of tangible micro considerations.  The difficult to measure intangible performance considerations are too frequently ignored.  The combination can create a culture of \"turning-red-boxes-green\" which actually don't matter to the business.  \r\n\r\nLeaders of the valuable cultural attributes can easily become whacked in the review process.  Especially when managers are changed on a frequent basis (I've averaged 1.5 managers/year, not counting two in the box managers of my work).\r\n\r\nThis can result in team members being rewarded for the wrong behaviors.  Also the individual performance evaluation (focal ranking and rating process with forced distributions) leads to dysfunctional team dynamics (political, back stabbing behaviors).  When your livelihood is on the line, individuals morals become fully revealed overtime.  Over my service I believe I have seen at least 6 head count reduction actions, split pretty evenly between \"voluntary\" and \"involuntary\" actions.  Given forced distributions, there is always the chance that a bad review year will combine with a involuntary head count reduction.  Many good folks are being let go this time around and Intel's competitors will benefit from the skilled people being released.  \r\n\r\nIn this environment Exempt employees can expect to work +60hrs/week minimum."

(4)  Too many meetings, though this is probably true of all companies.  (5)  No option for standing desks (though we could by our own commercially available desktop units)  (6) They recently laid off  alot of people based upon the level of stock grant.  However the stock grant was not awarded based upon merit evenly across the company, and so many people are now locked out of the company forever because they were supposedly laid off based upon merit.  Luckily I had managers with the foresight to be generous with stock awards.  (7)  Cubicle farm like most companies.  (8)  If you want to be promoted you have to work on the high profile projects and get noticed.  There are only so many of these to go around so yes talking with people and going to the meetings is worthwhile for career advancement.

Now the benefits are lower but the salaries remain the same.\r\nSmall working environment.  Never had offices.  Started off with gray 72 sq ft cubicles.  Then they \"compressed\" the cubicles to 48 sq ft.  Then they replaced the 6'-tall gray cubicle walls with 5'-tall tan walls to \"facilitate collaboration\".  This just made things noisier.  They also shrunk the furniture to make your 48 sq ft veal pen feel roomy.  Now they are compressing these smaller cubes into 36 sq ft.

		"pros": "Intel is one of the most technologically advanced companies. There are many rumors about Intel's work culture and brutality. But one I need clarify, if you want to be a leader and stay there for decades you need to be brutal. \r\n\r\nWork life balance: It varies from group to group. If you are in the CMOS manufacturing (which is main area Intel is the leader) then work life balance is bad. If you are more away from the wafer, things are far better. \r\n\r\nCompensation:  I have interviewed with several companies in bay area and wanted to give an idea about this.\r\nRemember this is not software company, so comparison with Google, FB, will not be meaningful.\r\n\r\nBase Salary: Average, or below average compared to other hardware companies. Annual increase in fab locations (Oregon, Arizona) is low. But in Santa Clara is higher. However they compensate this low salary by other things (see below)\r\n\r\nBonus: In last few years overall bonus varied from ~14%-19%. If you notice, the minimum bonus is ~14% which quite high for many other companies. So, if you get an offer in other companies keep in mind that Intel regularly pays good bonus (compared to HW companies).  Profit sharing Bonus: Quarterly, Performance Bonus: Annually.\r\n\r\nStock Refresh: This will be variable, for a 6 yr experienced Intel employee, I was getting ~$20k annually (this is stock level 2, where stock level 1 is the best). vest in 4 years with one-fourth yearly\r\n\r\n401k: IMPORTANT: even if you DO NOT contribute anything, Intel deposits ~5% of your annual salary in 401k. Means, if your annual salary is $100k, you will get $5000 in your 401k even if you dont contribute anything. Catch is: it does vest immediately, you need to stay for 6 years to get all vested, if you stay for 4 yrs or less only 40% will be vested.",

The Intel name looks great on your resume and can boost your career.  Intel has many very intelligent and dedicated employees that want the company to succeed.  But...",
		"cons": "The best way to currently describe Intel is \"High Risk\".  The company has struggled with poor leadership and has stopped living the core values that made Intel great.  Since founder Andy Grove retired, an executive power struggle ensued over the past 10 years and many of the best senior managers have left for better opportunities or due to health issues.  Intel has prided itself in driving industry transitions but has absolutely missed the mobile revolution (smartphones and tablets) and is ill positioned to catch up to it's ARM competition (Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, TI, etc).  There is little work-life balance despite frequent HR programs to improve moral so expect to typically work 60-70 hours per week and in excess of 80 during peek times, including early morning, late evening and weekends.  I traveled up to 60% of the time domestic and international but 20-30% is typical.  Bottom line is your family and you will pay for the pay.  I worked there for over 20 years, loved the first several years and believed that I would finish my career at Intel.  Then things changed and would now not consider returning again."

		"cons": "1.  No growth, an execution problem, and a culture crisis\r\n\r\nIntel's revenue has been flat/down over the last 3 years, and we have some huge advantages that we've failed to leverage.  There's an execution problem that seems to be an outgrowth of middle management and certain critical product groups really not \"getting it\", \"it\" being that Intel faces an existential threat and can't afford to do things the way they've always been done.  Upper management is driving a culture change, but a not insignificant number of folks seem to have missed the memo.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Fundamentally political and bureaucratic environment\r\n\r\nOne of the firs things you'll hear when you join Intel is that it's exceptional in being a results-oriented meritocracy.  Drink this Kool-Aid at your own peril.  It is very much your usual corporate America environment.   Your success depends entirely on your manager and his/her manager.  Play the game or lose.  And losing in the current environment can mean losing your job.  \r\n\r\nAlso, in a company with the size and complexity of Intel, the number of stakeholders that need to \"buy in\" to any decision worth considering is staggering.  It can take forever to affect change and inevitably you will run into at least one person who will need to be dragged kicking and screaming to accept, or even try, something new (see point #1).\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  Subpar compensation and increasing duplicity from upper management on compensation\r\n\r\nIntel's explicit strategy on compensation is to pay better than market in good years, at market during avg. years, and below market during bad years...and there haven't been many good years recently.  \"Raises\" are essentially inflation buffers, and there have also been a number of changes to bonus calculations (large part of comp and the main lever for pay) and retirement/pension plans that are thinly veiled pay cuts.  Management seems to be resistant to being forthcoming about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Recruiting/staffing \"strategy\" is a mess for everyone involved\r\n\r\nThe company pays a premium for \"top tier\" talent, but any effort to differentiate between \"top\" talent and others seems to be abandoned when candidates are placed.  A significant amount of Masters and PhD hires are paid top dollar only to be tool or design monkeys, and they hate their jobs.  Stars from OK schools are understandably frustrated when they compare notes, and older managers are not immune to jealousy either.  It's a lose lose for everyone involved.  Intel's locations are horrible for attracting younger talent as well.  Phoenix, Portland, and Folsom are less than stellar locales for young professionals.  \r\n\r\n\r\n5.  \"Lifer\"/\"True Believer\" culture becoming more intense in the new, more challenging environment\r\n\r\nIntel's taken pride in being a company with a culture that induces people to \"commit\" to being lifers or jumping ship early.  Middle managers seem to have the directive to weed out people they think aren't in it for the long haul.  The kind of openness you can have about medium or long term goals is limited.  This is something to be conscious of."

No career growth since the team itself has become stagnant and has lost its reputation with poor performance in the recent projects. Still a lot of churn in the team.\r\n5.

The work environment is typically clean, social, and safe, as Intel focuses on security and social interaction for profits. Intel frequently offers small amenities, side benefits like gyms, cafe's, coffee areas, open patios, etc. to their workers to improve the workplace \"feel\", to build a complete package of benefits to offset their slightly lower than market price in straight salary.  Intel is a very social-conscious workplace, where your status is malleable depending on your network skills, ability to work with others, and innovation.",
		"cons": "Huge company, and every Fab, area, and department are different in culture from every other. If you get a good manager, your job is wonderful.  If you have a bad one, there is almost zero recourse to change that, and your career will suffer quickly. AS a large corporation, interdepartment politics plays heavily, and often workers suffer from the bad ideas of one department impacting others, and too often, silly decisions are made with no regard to impact on others.  One example:  In order to save money, the training department fired personnel who used to prepare the classrooms with materials, schedule classes, etc.. THen, every other department had to start printing their own materials for every class, schedule classes without a central booking feature, and suddenly, classes were held without teachers, without students, rooms conflicted because two classes were scheduled together, and every teacher suddenly spent hours more per class in the photocopy room, making booklets for classes than ever before.  This lead to frustration, lost time, and an abandonment of the program by the volunteer teachers, which lead to fewer classes, which lead to fewer trained workers, which forced the training organization to hire new people to straighten out the mess, and we are back at square one, except our experienced class managers are fired, new, inexperienced ones are taking their place, and the teaching pool is reduced from frustration.  And, thousands of man-hours have been wasted on the effort."

		"pros": "The best reasons to work for Intel Corporation include the many degrees of flexibility bestowed to employees, the ability to work for a leading manufacturing company and the multitude of resources that go along with that, and the location of the company - Portland, Oregon.  Flexibility at Intel Corp means working from home, having no supervision of vacation, skewing shifts, working out at gym which is conveniently located at work, and ability to do daily tasks while at work.  Leading manufacturing company is somewhat intuitive, but the benefits go beyond the ability to put it on a resume.  Learning the aspects that make them successful and applying those to future endeavors.",
		"cons": "The downsides of working for Intel corp are as numerous if not more numerous than the upsides.  The most obvious downsides include: Intel is a large, I repeat large company - having over 80,000 employees worldwide, recognition and feeback at Intel corp is nearly non existent, and carreer advancement and ability to move up is extremely inhibited.  In my humble opinion, all of Intel's problems stem from its size (my first point against it) but I will elaborate on the main two deficencies stemming from the shear size.   Feedback at Intel is a once/year process and it is written by the employee him/herself and thus not true feedback, recognition (read reward) is an extremely bearucratric process driven by corporate distributions of how the company should reward on a whole.  Thus if you are in a small strong group, good luck!"

Groups work at cross purposes to ensure failure of other groups.\r\nA lot of groups are adrift. There is a general lack of buzz, and my guess is that it has a lot to do with not knowing how they can contribute. Very hard for management to do anything about such teams.\r\nSome groups have bad work/life balance. Poor first/second line planning means that these groups are firefighting all the time."

The resources of a large company allow high dollar projects and collaborating across the world. Vacation time is not recorded for salaried employees and is mostly managed by the employee (and maybe his manager). Schedules are often very flexible for engineers (not technicians or FAB employees). Personal growth is encouraged and there are programs to try and help employees expand their skill set. Retirement contribution of ~5% is given annually to a 401K, regardless of the employees own contributions (i.e. not matching). Paid sabbaticals are given every 4 (additional 4 weeks) or 7 years (additional 8 weeks). That is probably the main advantage of working at Intel over similar companies in the area.",
		"cons": "Being young at Intel is very difficult. Employees are considered \"new\" until they've been here 10+ years and given little respect. The raise / promotion system is heavily dated and causes serious problems within groups and among peers (strict quotas for promotions and ranking employees within a group). The benefits across the board have been heavily cut over the past 5-10 years, resulting in a significantly worse overall package than before. No shuttles available at the main headquarters (to SF, San Jose, etc).

Less time in FAB :-) True open door policy without fear of retaliation from manager.",

Career development only applies if you want to stay in manufacturing or if an exempt. This is contrary to  new employee orientation. Focal process is a 'meritocracy' which is a great idea but not true. Focal is based more on perception of work rather than true work and contributions. Decision making process is slow rather than \"small and rapid improvements' as preached. Corporate break schedule is not enforced by manufacturing management. This leaves employees abusing breaks which put a burden on the \"true\" workers. Probably a contributing reason that impact productivity. Especially since there's a dedicated workforce, \"remote operations\", to processing wafers but don't really do much but monitor screens for faults; then notifies a floor manufacturing technician. Management does not utilize remote operations manufacturing technicians, and floor technicians don't want them too. This probably is more for a sense of job security."

For this reason, I saw many of the most talented software folks leave after several years from fear of resume rot.\r\n\r\nAnother point to be aware of for just about everyone at Intel, assuming you are ok at your job, your quality of life will depend almost entirely on who your direct manager is - and if you don't have a good one, your life will be miserable. Even if you are exceptional at your job, your career will go nowhere without a decent manager backing you. Spend too long under a not-so-great manager, and your career will be irreparably damaged - this is not a statement of hyperbole or jest. The way the employee ratings and ranking system is arranged requires that your manager play a serious political game, and if they are unable or unwilling, you will end up stalled. \"Stall\" too long - even being a key contributor to a business critical project- and you will get flushed by HR - also not a joke."

We had several roadmap meetings with basically no information and immediately after each of these, the staff immediately agreed that \"this is chaos\" and lost faith after virtually every roadmap update. \r\n\r\nIn all companies there is nepotism, but this group seems to be particularly bad; for example, certain team leads circumvent the normal reporting structure due to deals they made. Moreover, there are conflicting attitudes about knowledge sharing and certain teams get special treatment. This can cause repeat work and resentment between teams. Fast execution is not the organizations strong suit and it needs to be in this industry. Too many programs get started and then cancelled too close to completion and it causes discouragement and \"rot\" (so to speak) with the employees. Some of the cancelled products would have been great if they had just been turned around and completed quickly, marketed fast, and whether they did well or not, they would have resulted in good lessons learned. I came to the group with the expectation of fast execution and management did not deliver. \r\n\r\nAlso, everyone is old and lame. Diversify your hiring and get a good mix in there. \r\n\r\nOne more thing; don't force us to use crappy tools such as sharepoint. Let us use slack and confluence wikis etc. Information sharing and collaboration is tremendously enhanced by using modern tools."

Also severance packages are great for long term Intel employees.",
		"cons": "- Big democratic company, decision making is extremely slow at almost all levels\r\n- In absence of any timeline pressures this is the best place I have worked for in my career. But  throw in some project deadlines, things just change upside-down and org politics shows its ugly face. Most of the people in these situations try to save the jobs in the next Op-ex rather than helping each other out.\r\n- Information is the king in this company. The more one knows about where to get it and who to get it from matters more than an acquired technical or business skill. So people new to the company often struggle.\r\n- Below par base salary in the industry. It may not be the same case for engineers especially working in the areas Intel has its vision in (Self- driving, AI etc), but for most of the support functions like IT and HR for instance, compensation is not competitive. \r\n- So many managers! Most of the managers I have seen are pure people managers and do not have in-depth technical or business knowledge to contribute in critical projects.  If that's the only job a manager has, unfortunately many of them don't do it well. I attribute the reason of this to institutionalization. People just get so used to the culture which is not really modern and forward-looking. May be Intel can take a leaf out of new-gen companies like FB or Google in this regard.\r\n- Its hard to get a true feeling of belonging in this company. Its huge and there are so many people who are not co-located but work in the same teams, people just work in emotional/professional silos.\r\n- Blurry visibility on career growth. Like I said it is easier to move horizontally but not vertically. At the most people tend to get grade jumps but even those are not without a lot of political ground-work, infighting and unpredictable.\r\n\r\nIn short, I would not hesitate to work for Intel, but I would always be on the look out for the grass on the other side and will jump ship at the first decent opportunity without thinking a lot."

Towards the end of my stint at Intel, most of my week was spent in meetings trying to manage expectations, reporting on workflow efficiencies / inefficiencies to management, and arguing with other teams on behalf of my team.\r\n* Raises and promotion are not truly merit based; your success in the company depends on being on the right projects, in the right groups, and being able to sell yourself to management.\r\n* There are some truly great engineers at Intel. However, in larger organizations at Intel, management tends to try and fill positions as quickly as possible (or risk losing headcount). This results in there being a lot of engineers that don't have the skill set needed to do their jobs well, which can be very frustrating.\r\n* Numerous 'big personality' types at Intel. These are usually very senior and principle engineers that have been in organizations for a while. They are easy to identify; their names will come up in conversations when discussing new ideas, usually in fear that the 'big personality' will come down from their high altar in the mountains and smite anyone that doesn't conform. Often these people bring little value to the organization, but they've managed to hold the organization hostage due to their long term presence and 'wisdom'."

The work is very difficult, but successful engineers thrive in that environment. Intel also has a dominant market share now, and it is rewarding to be working for a company that wins.  Base compensation is market competitive, and the bonus structure makes overall cash compensation better than market in good years.  They have very progressive health benefits that are some of the best in the industry.",

In an 86,000 employee company, this can be frustrating - one knows that other people have probably solved or at least encountered your problems in the past, but it is hard to find those people.  Additionally, the culture at Intel is relatively direct and for certain people this confrontational style can be intimidating.  In certain organizations (notably IT), morale is currently low because they have experienced significant cuts in their headcount."

Intel also highly encourages employees who are getting burned out or bored at their current job to seek another job within Intel.  This is a benefit from my opinion in that you are able to always stay in a job that is entertaining and challenging.  Another good thing about Intel are the health benefits.  Though like everywhere they have increased in cost over the last few years, they have helped me and my family significantly throughout my years of working there.",
		"cons": "I think the biggest downside of Intel would be the lack of recognition for effort and the complete recognition for delivery.  This means that it is extremely important to ensure that you are personally involved in projects that are well funded and have the support of management.  If you end up in a position that does not have that, advancement and recognition will both be difficult.  It also has the potential to reward people who merely happen to be in the right place at the right time versus those produce the best and most complete solutions.  Another downside of Intel is that they tend to pay on the low end of the industry average.  Something else to keep in considersation is that Intel is a silicon manufacturing company.  And as such, they always have their focus on hardware development and manufacturing.  This can result in less importance being attributed to other areas that the company works in (i.e. Software Development)."

Intel does not lay off engineers - no layoffs during the dot com bubble burst.  Very little politics - people don't have time for it.

		"cons": "Intel\u2019s work culture is based on the book written by Andrew S. Grove titled \u201cOnly the paranoid survive\u201d. Intel HR policies and management promotes this culture of paranoia in every employee of Intel. Per Wikipedia \u201cParanoia is a thought process heavily influenced by anxiety or fear, often to the point of irrationality and/or delusion. Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory beliefs concerning a perceived threat towards oneself. Historically, this characterization was used to describe any delusional state.\u201d \r\n\r\nAs far as what I have seen, this kind of practice of making employees paranoia has made many or most Intel employees unhappy. In addition to the three letter abbreviations used at Intel, there are many other phrases used at Intel such as \u201cslap on the face\u201d. Simple things such as someone asking you a question while you are explaining to a group is \u201cSlap on the face\u201d since you did not do your job well enough to explain properly. I totally disagree with this kind of philosophy and it leads to a culture of un-openness. \r\nSimply asking your manager a question on his/her direction or suggesting some alternative solution which is better could get you labeled as \u201cdifficult\u201d. Why? Because first of all, if your manager agrees to your suggestion, it would imply that your manager was wrong or did not think through. As such, your manager would fiercely fight back to any suggestions which are contrary to what your manager thinks. Secondly, your manager suggestions might be based on his/her politics or anger towards someone else which your manager could not explain to you properly. I once found mistake that someone else did which could have cost up couple of days of downtime and when I told my manager, she responded that this is not what I asked you to do and rebuked me. The person who made the mistake actually thanked me for finding that mistake. So, I also think that a lot depends on who your manager is. Some manager wants you to do exactly what you are told without thinking but the problem is when things go wrong, you get all the blame since you did not think it thoroughly. Makes sense, no.. right? Welcome to the world of paranoia\u2026 enjoy working at Intel!"

If you put in the time and energy to learn and succeed, and express your interests in where you want to go to your manager, you will almost always have the support to help get you there. Continuing education is well supported (both through work/life balance and through reimbursement in some cases). Opportunities to do rotations and explore new fields/roles are abundant.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I like that may be a deterrant for some people is the very direct culture: People will tell you if they think your idea needs work, but the culture is very data driven and you work with some very smart people. As long as you support your position with data and logic you will pretty much always be fine. \r\n\r\nWork/life balance flexibility is great - 1 day work from home per week, other flexible hours options upon manager approval. Can't complain about the flexibility. In terms of work - to be successful you need to take on a lot of work, and it can be stressful at times, but if you like a challenge it can be pretty awesome.",

As such, I don't feel like my compensation reflects my experience, education, level of responsibility, or the value I bring to the company any more.\r\n\r\nPay is allegedly based on merit, but I have not seen much evidence for it. You have to earn your promo several years in a row before you'll get it... If you're also buddy buddy with your manager. \r\n\r\nWe like to make things hard on ourselves at times and need to invent a new tool for everything - even when there's a good off-the-shelf or previously created solution that could be easily adapted."

It is very easy to become pigeonholed into a solitary role for many years.  You need to actively seek out new opportunities to widen your skill base because Intel won't do that for you.  In fab/sort the ONLY way to be promoted to a manger is if your DIRECT manager leaves Intel or moves to another group, and you are the senior engineer in the group.  By default, you will be promoted.  There is no annoucement, no call for applicants.  You could be a senior engineer in one group for 10 years and be excellent at what you do...but someone with far fewer years and experience and awards will be promoted to manager simply because their manager left to do something else.

You can have a good work-life balance; on the other hand, if you like to work a lot, Intel will take that and put it in its pocket. \r\nManagement is promoted from the engineering ranks. This has is good and bad. On the good side, they understand your job and can help you. On the bad side, the managers can focus too much on the problem of the day and not on longer term things like people development, career coaching, and other \"softer\" management functions. So plan on taking charge of your own career.\r\nIntel used to shower us with cash - mainly from stock options. Those days are over - the stock has been stagnant for over 10 years. \r\nYou'd think that being at Intel, you'd have access to some of the best computer equipment in the world. You'd be wrong. You'll get a \"business class\" laptop, which is not good for engineering data analysis. However, with enough push, you can get a high performance desktop system."

If you get in the right group can really be a great experience. BK and most of the exec staff have a true appreciation of people and creating a good work environment. Good benefits. Physical work environment for me was good (1970s era cubicles with separate lab space), but rapidly converting to mobile work environment which is *horrible* for technical/knowledge workers.",
		"cons": "Big, slow, encumbered by past success, unable to move crisply and decisively to take advantage of opportunities. New experienced execs brought in to build new agile organizations only succeed in building self-serving fiefdoms. \r\n\r\nI came to Intel after having worked at several start-ups (I had also been a Founder in the past). Very, very bureaucratic - one spends 90% of your time justifying your existence and 10% doing actual work. Intel has a disease prevalent at many large aging organizations that are coasting on past success: information hoarding and herds of people spending time guarding their turf. In a start-up environment I spent a lot of time working with colleagues to get things done. At Intel I spent too much time justifying what I was doing, and why working to address other orgs fears that I (and my org) would encroach on their turf. Very depressing.\r\n\r\nMy first two levels of management (immediate supervisor and Director) were horrible - long time Intel employees who managed me remotely and had no clue about what I should be doing, and what I was doing. THis despite proactive weekly status reports from me. I don't think my immediate manager ever read any status reports I sent. After I left Intel I also found out he also failed to pass along any mgt feedback requests from HR."

It is kind of amazing for a company that makes billions and billions of $, but I called it \"Intel constantly cries poverty\".  \r\nRaises/Promotions - Significant raises and promotions rarely happen unless the employee takes the initiative to actually apply for a position outside of his/her group.  Big raises and promotions will not happen based on one's own merit of working hard.   My biggest advice is anyone at Intel is don't stay in a job or a group for more than 2-3 years and make every move a new job promotion.

Intel is great at showing a professional appeal to be part of creating something new and exciting. Very few companies are ready to challenge the boundaries and take risks like Intel does. I got a few opportunities for learning how to improve current designs and execute engineering principles. Most other places would be content in a steady cash flow and not try to grow horizontally.

I helped in the initiation of new hires and within a couple of months we were a team of 8. I tried my best to be a team player but I never got the same feeling from the other members. My manager was extremely ambitious and most people did not like him since he was new at it. I had no such issues and was actually very impressed with his work ethics. I also did not like how much time was spent in meetings. If I had a few more experienced and helpful people in my group, I think I would have left with a less bitter taste.

So 15% on the employee within a group will always received a below average grade no matter how much work they have done. Employees are also ranked within a group based on their value. This makes work somewhat competitive and does not promote teamwork. These grades are also solely based on what your manager thinks, therefore if your manager does not know how much work you are doing, you may not be graded fairly despite this being your manager's fault. A bad manager can really prevent your career growth at Intel, no matter how well you perform.\r\n\r\nCubicles are mostly compressed making space somewhat limited. There are no offices. Some higher ups receive larger cubicles.\r\n\r\nWork-Life balance is in the hands of your manager. Bad managers will tend to accept any project or requirements despite not having the head count, requiring that any current members of the group work overtime in order to meet these added requirements. \r\n\r\nRecognition can be extremely poor and unfair. Often some people that work on a project are not recognized for their contribution due to them not directly working with the customer. Other times people are recognized (such as managers) for completing under resourced projects even though they do not contribute anything."

The fix is to push everyone into significantly smaller, but significantly more colorful cubes.\r\no Huge, mega-projects, involving 100's-1000's developers spanning multiple geographies.\r\no While Intel understands how important software is to their business, there is very little actual understanding of how to develop software.  \r\no Director level management (and up) are, more often than not - either corrupt, self-serving, or incompetent.  \r\no Armies of people appearing to be frantically busy, but actually developing/doing very little.  It is the appearance of progress which is valued.\r\no Like any large organization, there is a rather huge bureaucracy fueling it.\r\no Lots of meetings, lots of anonymous people demanding things from you, lots egos telling you how you must do something.\r\no Ship dates are routinely set from above.  Engineering estimates rarely used.\r\no Almost all attempts Intel has made to diversify beyond its core desktop CPU business, have failed on a massive scale (e.g., Larabee).  These project failures impact peoples' lives on a large scale.\r\no Questionable upper management decision making.  Recent acquisitions, such as Mcafee, are a case in point.\r\no Matrixed organizations with no one at the helm.\r\no Competitive, not a teamwork, oriented environment.  In general, you have to push to get someone to help you."

Doesn't matter if you are right or wrong, just matters if you can torture the data enough to confess agreement with your point.\r\n\r\nThe people I have seen who do well (i.e. get promoted quickly and rewarded handsomely) at Intel do one of three things:\r\n1. Invent the next iPhone.\r\n2. Succeed at solving very complex, intricate problems, saving the company (literally) millions.\r\n3. Use every moment at work to promote VISIBILITY for themselves, whether it is useful/needed or not.  \r\n\r\n They struggle mightily  with customer orientation and sometimes just don't understand why their ideas are not what others really want or need.  They do this basically because they are on a continual death march to not be considered a \"commodity.\"  They fear that once the point of \"it's just a processor\" is reached, their empire will crumble.\r\n\r\nAnd one more thing... as far as \"career opportunities\", yes, total agreement with others that their are many opportunities, HOWEVER the physical location of where you are at is directly related to said \"number\" of opportunity.  If you work at a plant that is outside of Hillsboro, Santa Clara, (maybe) Folsom, your \"opportunity\" starts to fall off VERY quickly.  So, choose your site carefully if you decide to join Intel."

I often felt like the company as a whole was on auto-drive, sticking to management styles, roadmaps, lifestyles that were familiar and comfortable to them, rather than taking risks and seeking true, sustainable positive changes. I witnessed an idea rejected because it wasn't on a years-old roadmap and thus deemed impossible to execute; Apple came out with devices that implemented the idea 6 months later. I sat in many meetings where the audience typed furiously on their laptops or snored loudly over the conference call during the presentation, giving 0 cares, or they pigeon-holed on a completely unrelated topic that delayed crucial decision-making. Everything at Intel felt like it moved slowly, bogged down by tradition and its resulting band-aid fixes/decisions.\r\n\r\nI also encountered serious issue with the company's management selection scheme. Managers seemed to be chosen based on how long they've been at Intel or what's on their outdated resume, rather than their demonstrated merits and character. When respected colleagues approached my manager requesting to change projects due to consistent sexist and demeaning comments made by the project manager, they were immediately told to quit whining or start looking for new jobs. When I approached my manager with concern that I felt unchallenged, was not experiencing growth, and reaching my potential, he told me that I shouldn't worry since learning the organization chart and how the different business units interacted with each other was still a major achievement.... UH, NO.... not after I've been there for about 2 years and I regularly expressed to him my goal to build my technical expertise.\r\n\r\nIn summary, based on my experience, Intel has some great people but if you're looking for serious growth and inspiration as a non-engineering designer, this is not the place you will find it."

The focus is more on getting things out the door to meet a deadline rather than quality.\r\n\r\nThere's also a strange reverence for the people who started Intel more than 40 years ago and trying to do things like they did back then.

		"cons": "Under some managers, resources were limited, scope fixed, deadlines dictated, overtime mandated, and there was very little by way of creative and innovative freedom.  \r\n\r\nIntel's annual focal process demands a full bell curve making it such that not everyone can be declared successful, even if all were.  Therefore it is common practice for managers to hire and keep a 'fall guy' around just so that they can meet statistical expectations.  Absolute preference is given to the minority classes when it comes to hiring practices, refferal bonuses, and promotions. \r\n\r\nAfter loosing a few key employees, my last manager started playing games with the focal process in order to retain employees he would dumb down job titles, suddenly you were a \"Software Engineer\" when previously you were a \"Senior Software Engineer\" and writing a minimal 1 page focal review for you, allowing for very little input, and minimizing statements of accomplishments.  This made it more difficult for us to transfer within the company, he knew that other internal managers would consider these reviews when you submitted yourself for a new job so the more worthless he made you appear the less likely you were to be able to move on.  When confronted on the topic, he assured me that all of Intel was now doing it this way now to save time because it was really just a way to facilitate a conversation of expectations between manager and employee.  I did some checking around with friends elsewhere in the company and found this to be an absolute lie.  Any and all attempts to raise these and other issues up the management chain just resulted in direct retribution from my manager, who managed to make my life even more miserable.  \r\n\r\nI once submitted an 'anonymous' ethical complaint about the very questionable practices of a colleague within the company, within 24 hours I personally heard from that individual who was herself investigating the complaint.  I learned the hard way that NOTHING is anonymous within this company and every complaint counts against you regardless of how valid it may be."

Senior management at Intel is often full of hubris, but lacking in judgement.  Additionally, they may listen to the wrong people and bad decisions that affect your life will issue forth and you'll feel like a little boat in a giant ocean with big, big waves.  As you probably find in most places, people are often interested in making their mark (notoriety) instead of doing the right thing and sometimes as bad as just wanting to hear their voice talk over others in meetings.

		"cons": "Flexibility (wait, what?), yes, flexibility is not always a good thing, since some managers expect you to execute a task even late at night (like 3am, 4am?) without OT claim. Much flexibility, so wow. This is sometimes not avoidable, because you are expected to adjust yours, and no one else's timetable to work with US/Bangalore counterparts. Yeah sure you can wake up late the next day, but with everyone else working in the morning, expect to get sounding/judging from the others.\r\n\r\nTeam activities, due to the overall culture in Intel (in my ex team in particular), team activities are usually forced or down right a waste of time. Watching movie (everyone watching different movie if I might add) in the cinema? How is that going to help with the team's morale? Outdoor activities are not any better, with managers not joining to managers joining, but not taking initiatives to lead the activities. You get the picture.\r\n\r\nWorkspace is a joke. Newcomers and only newcomers will be pushed to Kulim no matter what. It's \"part of their expansion program\", or so they claimed. Call me stupid, but aren't newcomers need more guidance than old timers? Or is it more convenient for the old timers to not make a change?\r\n\r\nTo sum it all up, there are much better working cultures out there with much better people and much better environment. Mediocre pay, mediocre benefits and mediocre facilities. The only thing Intel has, is its fame from decades ago being the dominated brand that we all came across while growing up, that's what it is, a company stuck in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. Google about Intel and see what came up, and with that you can basically tell what kind of culture you will be having to be working in Intel. Decision is yours to make."

The ideas, innovation, drive and creativity of Intel employees is astounding. It's invigorating to work here. Intel's innovation has literally changed the world. The combination of the company's financial track record, corporate social responsibility and environmental practices are unparalleled. Sure there are things in the work environment that need to be improved and updated. The good news is that senior leaders know this and are working on it thanks to open channels of communication and a very in-touch human resources function.  To sum up my experience of Intel as an employer in one word I'd say: integrity.",
		"cons": "A perpetual challenge at this large multinational company with employees in over 60 countries is building and developing relationships with co-workers on virtual teams. Another downside of working at Intel is watching the company miss opportunities that were within its grasp. For instance, because of Intel's position as a component supplier to the PC industry Intel has sometimes failed to benefit from its innovation. As an example, years ago Intel came out with an Intel branded MP3 player - this was years before the debut of iPod players.  Undoubtedly company strategists had the right idea and were ahead of the market, but they pulled back seemingly for fear of alienating downstream partners.  That was painful. On the bright side, the company learns from its mistakes."

Employees are well-respected for the most part, and they are encouraged to provide constant feedback to their immediate managers as well as senior management. The work environment is still very egalitarian; everyone gets cubicles, even managers. I can imagine that would not suit some, but for me it's perfect. Work hours are very flexible, and Intel tries to accomodate different employees needs. Finally, there is the pride of working in a company that even now continues to be at the forefront of technology and innovation, and Intel does a great job avoiding the curse of stagnation that has hit other high-tech firms like HP or IBM.",
		"cons": "Intel is still a company that is often run top-down. Although individual employee contributions and creativity are recognized, there is still a sense of process and bureaucracy within which every individual contributor has to function. This is also true for the rating and review process, which is necessary but seems somewhat rigid in its evaluation mechanisms. Change is occurring for the most part, but change seems to be slow which I guess is unavoidable in a company this size."

Intel is very demanding, and very detailed, when it comes to getting out the right product, with the right features, and the best cost structure.  Intel is probably more focused on cost now than at any time before, and that's a good thing in this current environment.  You need to come prepared to defend any feature that you want to implement, and with product horizons that are sometimes 5 years out, that can be difficult.  Still, this level of structure has produced some of the best products in the industry.",
		"cons": "It's easy to get frustrated sometimes when you see people making poorly informed decisions, and half of my job is to educate and make sure that planners from other teams know at least as much as I do.  The products I plan for often need features to be available in other products, and it can be very disheartening if those features get ZBB'ed due to cost reasons, when the ROI from my perspective is huge, and the other product planners don't feel the same way.  I've seen great opportunities for innovation fritter away because the usefulness of these features was misunderstood.  Even so, it's very rewarding when you can make a business case for a technology, and get it through the justification process."

Interspersed with lifers there are some very talented and motivated people as well. Once I built my network it was easier to avoid the lifers and get things done by focusing on the talented folks.

If you want to be successful, you need to be able to put in those extra hours that all American corporate companies expect ( note you probably won't get paid for them).  \r\nThe upper management creates a stable environment which has been able to shrug off countless down terms in the markets in recent years. I have seen many people come and go over the years. But they have kept much of the core team intact and improved it. \r\nThey are great benefits. healthcare.  It is the safest company I have ever worked at. The conditions are excellent. there are lots of onsite areas such as gym, clubs, even hair salons, multiple restaurants at each site. 90% of the people who work there are good honest, hardworking and focused people. In every company, there are a few bad eggs. The work is challenging but fun if you are prepared to work hard and possibly willing to travel you will be OK.  For me I enjoyed 25 years, I traveled and lived in foreign countries, was able to take my family with me on occasion. You need to make a choice if corporate America is for you.",

This lead to a worse situation particularly for those who spoke out. So, in the end, everyone just gave OK feedback or didn't bother."

Bonuses come regularly. The amount will vary depending on profitability of the company, but you can almost count on them.",

As a software engineer there are many interesting projects as well, from working Windows, Linux and Mac internals (not just drivers!) to whole operating systems like MeeGo.

The work environment is a bit soulless as well; drab cubes as far as the eye can see.

		"cons": "Work/life balance here means don't ever let your life get in the way of work from 7am to 4pm. After those hours, a compelling reason for absence is okay, as long is it happens infrequently and nothing bad happens when you're away. \r\n\r\nIn 4.5 years, I never saw anybody get a raise better than the real inflation rate. For the people managers love (which seems to have little to do with performance), they get 3%. Managers there love people that will not speak up when given impossible tasks or when told blatant lies. Managers all manage up, meaning they want you to say you are on top of everything so they can go back to their meetings. When something falls through the cracks, they want to be able to say you didn't ask for help. They do not want you to actually ask for help, and if you do they will burn your time up justifying what you've been doing every minute, but they never take anything off your task list. \r\n\r\nThe few Managers I saw that actually spent time trying to help their team get their jobs done were laid off or demoted. Everything new that is rolled out is presented with the punishments for not complying. I never saw a new initiative or process rolled out with rewards or positive encouragement. Every failure, even mechanical breakdowns like welds breaking, are viewed as personal discipline issues because a good engineer knows the condition of all their systems. If you asked to upgrade the system and got turned down, the failure is your fault because you didn't specify when and how it was going to fail, and you didn't re-submit your request with better justification.\r\n\r\nI had an alarm that went unattended for 2 hours and caused a problem. One root cause was that they just laid off 2 of the 3 job positions that were supposed to respond to the alarm and hadn't figured out a backfill plan yet (normally 3 job positions are all supposed to make sure the alarms are handled). Two of the three were laid off, the ops tech was busy repairing other broken equipment, and the managers at the incident review rejected those root causes. The only root cause accepted was the ops tech thought the alarm was not critical and took two hours to respond. The solution adopted was to change the alarm message to sound more critical.\r\n\r\nI've worked for many companies, and I've never seen a place where deception by omission is the only way to keep your job."

Health care benefits were fairly good and they have patient advocates who will take up your cause with the insurance provider if necessary which really blew me away the one time I needed them. Opportunities to work from home were superb.",
		"cons": "I worked at Intel for 8 1/2 years. The last couple of years were my most passionate and my greatest frustration. While none of my managers were malicious, their net effect was categorically abusive. I simultaneously had a skillset that was too critical to my server project to allow me to take an offered SoC \"Hot Job\" (jobs identified as critical for the company's future), but not worthy enough to address the career growth reasons for my dissatisfaction with the project that led me to want to leave, but they still offered me nearly half a years pay to voluntarily separate from the company to make space to hire more engineers for SoC. Let that sink in - I had been offered an SoC-related engineering job and my group blocked my transfer then offered me a large buyout to leave the company because they needed to make room to hire SoC engineers. Again, nobody was being malicious here, but I was in the middle of three different ridiculous circumstances caused by decision of three different levels of management all acting in what, at some level, was the most rational thing for them to do. At no point did anybody stand up to say \"the company is paying a good engineer we could use in SoC to leave the company. That doesn't seem right.\"\r\n\r\nIntel will tell you largely and loudly about how much they value the people working there, but they have erected systemic barriers that allow pathological levels of cruelty towards these same people. Intel will shout until they are Intel-blue-in-the-face that they have these wonderful systems for recognizing and rewarding accomplishments, but they're very inconsistent in their use. I worked on my own time for two years creating an architectural firmware debugging GUI tool. After it was announced that I was leaving, architects and engineers from different teams and different projects popped up to make sure that the source code would be available once I was gone. Over 400 hours of my own time creating it, other engineers apparently thinking that preservation of the source for it was of paramount importance, yet it was never deemed enough of an accomplishment for either recognition or reward. I can think of few more stinging ways to wound a departing engineer. When the buyout offer was extended to everyone, 5 acceptees were asked to delay their departure because their skills were needed badly. I was one of those 5 and to this day one of my greatest regrets of my 8 years at Intel was agreeing to it.\r\n\r\nI offer this example for illustrative purposes to demonstrate the dysfunctional connection between Intel's intentions, and Intel's actions. That last tool was not the first time I had identified a need, spent my own time providing a solution, had the tool picked up by many other engineers but received no notice from management until I moved on -- it was the third. The problem is systemic with deep roots. It also isn't why I left. I left because my career growth was dependent on the cooperation of a junior engineer who was getting rewarded with annual review bullet points for non-cooperation."

Many times the multi-month work of whole department (not only my team) was thrashed, because some new boss would come and \"not favor\" your team and whatever result was done to that date. \r\nGlobal cross-team coordination effort was very low to non-existent. Teams would \"fight\" for resources, and have a quite unhealthy competition. Decision would be made with some irrelevant considerations, and forced down to my team. \r\nAs result, the culture actually experienced would not be really engaging. \r\n\r\nThe performance review process is essentially botched. Some much higher management essentially issues a quota on number of good performance ratings to your team. Then, you end up in a situation when no matter how much you tried, you'd be stuck at your performance grade, because no good rating can be made available to you (again despite the acknowledgement of high level of contribution and such). Example: our team received only one EE (exceeds expectations) rating, and my manager decided to use it to promote one particular employee (citing his family situation (he had a new child, etc), and his current lower grade).

Many top managers have left the company and now BK's right hand (Renee James) is also \"jumping ship\". One of Brian's strategy is to let go of experienced middle aged employees (35+) and replaced them with low paid interns and recent college graduates in order to cut costs (He recently fired ~4k employees who had been with the company for years and said more layoffs will continue). In one of his speeches to Intel Employees, he said that employees are disposable, all that matters is the survival of the corporation, continuity of Moore's Law and the name of the corporation. He has taken away many of employee perks: Work from home day, work life balance, team builder off-site's, etc... The moral of Intel employees is down and there is no job security - Therefore, employees are not performing at their best.  Management group is very \"clicky\" - they hire their friends and help them get into Mgmt by giving them top job reviews - but no one dares say anything because even though the feedback says \"confidential\" they are not - and once you get on the bad side of one manager, you are sunk. If you do a job really well and then want to move to a different position, your direct manager has complete control of your carrier development and may keep you on one role for as long as they want. Focal (yearly job reviews) are a joke... they have to be written by the employee in third person because managers are to lazy to write them and no matter how long you spend or how good you have sold yourself, the manager will still give top reviews to their preferred employees. Standard pay raises are between 0 and 3% per year - as of recent, pay raises average about 1%, since the corporation is going through financial stress - a 1% pay raise does not even cover the increase of cost of living. \r\nIs it a good place to work? Yes it is - but do not stay on one job for more than a year and be ready to leave after 3 to 5 years. The benefit of working for Intel is mainly to get the experience on your resume - it opens bigger opportunities - better pay - elsewhere."

Overall, considering schools, traffic, and you will get a nicer neighborhood, it is a much better trade off than living in the  big name cities.  The sabbatical is a very nice break to work on some longer projects (community, study, travel, or simply home improvement).  After a long and exhausting project, managers (at their discretion) will normally compensate for \"compensation time\" for a few days off the record.  I have experience where I needed to call off a vacation because of work and the company paid for all air-ticket change fees.  The 401K and other health benefits have various options but the latest trend is to go for HRA to reduce monthly premiums.  In terms of stocks, they have been giving RSU's and that depends on performance.  the number of RSU grants is tied to a certain percentage at lower grade levels and then become a much larger number for staff level and above.  There are also quarterly bonuses tied to company performance (an equation determines the amount).  Since there are lots of sites across the US and around the globe, you can carry-on with your life changes without leaving the company.",
		"cons": "The pension plan has been stopped for current hires and the education subsidy has been much reduced.  That may be inline with other companies.\r\nI have also seen cases where a less experienced external new hire getting a better pay/benefit package than a performing existing employee.

You spend far too much time navigating illogical processes that have no accurate documentation, if this is for purchasing or using your \"benefits\".  Corporate policies are years (decades?) behind the norm for high tech employers, if that is health benefits or workplace practices.  \r\n\r\nThe IT department itself, and any services provided by them is a perfect example of what can go wrong in a large corporate environment.  The IT department is obviously not accountable to making employees successful, they have ancient practices and do little to support users.  The policies they have in place for your personal mobile device or any computer system that you use is beyond draconian...and the policies are entirely illogical.  They force you to change the passcode on your personal phone every 60-90 days, however they don't use a single one-time-password (aka 2 factor authentication) anywhere within your standard IT systems.  If your business unit *allows* you to use a non-windows workstation, good luck on getting it to actually work. Most of the IT policies seem to be to just wish you luck and stop talking to you.  Their policies may work fine if you are in the fabrication facilities, however not if you work in a modern group focused on software as the security policies block many development environments from even working viably without spending 40% of your time playing cat-and-mouse trying to find how to work within the new policy, or the one that intermittently acts differently. \r\n\r\nThe work environment is pretty toxic, they reward \"lifers\" that have been there forever who then immediately dismiss new ideas as not being valid.  They obviously need fresh ideas (innovator's dilemma) however their own practices and structure often drown those ideas before they can even be discussed.  \r\n\r\nThe CEO tries to claim it is a \"growth company\" while doing nothing to modernize business practices, empowering employees, or even investing adequately in growth opportunity.  Most of middle management spends their time clambering over each other trying to grow their headcount and budget allocations rather than actually running there business units.  Everyone is building their own fiefdom with duplication of resources and effort, wasting massive allocations of resources in the process...until your team loses and then you get the axe."

Unless, you have a poor manager, Intel offers an employee to take their career where you want it to go, there is not just one path.  You will be exposed to many smart people, you learn to look at people to what they bring to the table via their brain.",
		"cons": "Intel is an interesting company in that it is engineering in it's history.  That blindspot does tend to defocus Intel from time to time.  I also think Intel is slightly cultish at times to a fault. I separate the top MCM team, because these are all rich people, from the large masses at Intel, for the most part I have traveled and learned about people and worked on teams where we have accomplished quite a bit.  Intel's Supply Chain (where I work) is consistently ranked in the top 5 in the world, the sky is the limit.  However, and this is important do not let you lust for advancement bypass a poor manager, a poor manager at Intel will take you out or at best make your life miserable until you find another job.  Seek out like minded career goal oriented people and build a network, this will come in handy down the road, when a cool job opens up or you want to leave a horrible manager.  Network, network, network, never take anything for granted."

In the even of familial bereavement some companies allow 2-days paid vacation, I was told \"take as much time as you need\".\r\n- Training is readily available & encouraged in-house & outsourced (if not available in-house).\r\n- Employees are encouraged to own their own careers & identify knowledge gaps & pursue avenues of interest as this will only ever benefit the business ultimately.\r\n- The business is so vast & sprawling you may move between departments, shifting roles & organisations if your interest is piqued in another area.",
		"cons": "- Compared to other businesses, Intel's salaries are relatively low.  The logic being that the stock purchase programs, bonuses & awarding of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) makes up for the deficit in salary.\r\n- Stock seldom retains reasonable value.  Many of the old guard (folks having served 15-20yrs) are stuck with no small quantity of shares purchased at nearly twice the current (2017) stock va lue.\r\n- Restricted Stock Units (RSUs):  Sound like a great annual bonus, until you realise the units have to remain owned by Intel and/or the stock management company for YEARS before you're permitted to realise their value.\r\n- Headcount reduction:  Every 5yrs there is a headcount cull.  Every 10years it is a BIG ONE.  Know that your position within Intel is never \"safe\" or \"secure\".  Times come & go when EVERYONE is watching their back, morale hits rock bottom (company-wide).  At these times management nor senior management seem to know how to raise morale... This results in any effort to allay fears only really resulting in a further exacerbation of the issue as employees are pushed to continue as usual, as if their livelihood isn't at stake (Needless:  This does nothing to improve the situation).\r\n- Near constant efforts to push automation & reduce head count results in greater & greater expectation from employees who are expected to pick up the slack for the roles which have been removed from your organisation (I.e. Lots of people are fired?  The folks remaining are expected to continue the work & responsibilities of those who have been sacked.\r\n- Cashless payment:  This really opened my eyes to how Intel considers it's employees (resources, not people).  I was tasked with assisting in the installation of a cashless payment system (one which is present on a few Intel sites).  These systems do not adhere to any data protection rulings in the UK or EU.  Repeated ethics complaints were submitted & summarily ignored (to varying degrees - Lawyers were involved, but little was done to rectify the situation).  This has (STILL) left Intel employees more open to identity theft & open to people/s with nefarious intent as the security surrounding the cashless payment is still accessible on the internet (accessible by ANYONE) with approaching ZERO security in place to prevent remote access to the personally identifiable details of hundreds (possibly thousands) of totally unwitting people."

No matter how well you perform or how much you sacrifice your time, the company is numb to reward you.\r\n\r\nYou are not a priority in everything small. There is no free food. It's an old company. It doesn't feel grateful for people who work hard for the company's good. And it doesn't really care if you work here and you love to work here. What kills is that there is no dinner when you work after-hours. Hunger and thirst are your best pals. The canteen which you must pay and tastes like hell is closed. Vending machines will be accompanying you. And it's another place you can't owe money.\r\n\r\nYou are also not a priority in everything big. Intel is generally reluctant to pay you.

But two month ago, I finally had an astounding raise in the salary when my manager ranked my last year as successful. And the raise for the successful was 2.1%. I can't thank the company too much for this, because it even didn't reach the US inflation rate! When my manager presented the number to me. I was startled, utterly speechless and faint to argue. The company that I paid homage to with the faith and worked for with the belief treated me in the way I can only describe as shabby and mean. I've trying to quench my anger, frustration and desperation for 2 months. But I found it's much harder than I thought.\r\n\r\nSoon after my onboarding day, I found the company is filled with people passionless. Now I understand why, because I've become one of them."

This is a manufacturing company at its core, any consideration of balance goes out the window as soon as there is even a hint it will affect production.

There is a force fit to the bell curve within a group.  The tails of the curve are where things happen, for promotions or getting flagged as an under performer.\r\n\r\nIt's better to be on a weak team so you can stand out more easily.  If you wind up on a strong team you may be a star performer but if everyone else is too, then you wind up in the middle of the pack when it comes to evaluations, raises & promotions.  Play the game or remain stuck in the middle."

Everybody treat everybody with respect, knowledge is gained and shared. Employees are treated as humans. An Intel employee was very proud to be working there.\r\n\r\nToday, the company is a mess. Projects are getting more and more stressful. Employees focus on taking care of their own interests and the ugly side of office politics rears its head. Now it's only about \"Hire and Fire\"... it's not uncommon to hear about which department or group got closed down, employees getting retrenched, or moved to jobs that they don't care anything about. It's all about survival in Intel now. Gone are the days of making great technologies that will change the world. Unfortunately, many working there are still delusional, everyday hoping that their INTC stock price would go back up to more than USD100++ like the days of old. Oh well... that's not gonna happen... not with the Intel today.\r\n\r\nYou might be hired for a certain job, but don't be surprised if your manager transferred you to a totally different job upon joining. Employees are treated as an item in a spreadsheet instead of valuable talent. Sorry, it's true even though you want to disagree.\r\n\r\nIf you have to chance to go into one of their 'design centres', immediately you'll notice the sombre and depressed mood the employees are in. A certain design centre is famous for its Dungeon Mood which, in my opinion, is counter productive.\r\n\r\nLet's not talk too much on the focal system.

In some groups employees are locked into a position in which there is no time to develop your career; employees get stuck doing the job of 3 people and at review process get reprimanded or laid off for not doing anything else.  \n\nBeginning to have very scandalous labor practices on employees.   HR is very deceitful!!!!  Managers are told to give lower stock level shares no matter if employees deserved it or not and little did these managers know HR used it as a criteria lay off thousands of employees.   \n\nQuestionable criteria for laying people off.   If an employee is over 40 it is an automatic target for future lay offs.   \n\nFor anybody looking to work at Intel keep in mind 75% is fitting in plus self-promoting and 25% work.   Try not to get locked into a position in which you cannot work on your own PR and development because the company will use all the Hardwork you just gave them against you at review time.  \n\nSeeing lots of very good employees being tossed out of the company and told you are never allowed to come back!  Meanwhile,  the employee has just given many years of great service to the company and then being treated like a criminal.   \n\nLoyalty to the company only goes one way!  Don't waste your time being loyal to Intel only be loyal to yourself and work on self-promotion.   \n\nHard Work is kind of recognized but without the self PR piece is will not be rewarded but later reprimanded.   \n\nFor employees affected in this round of layoffs it sincerely was not due to low performance but more so lack of upper management making incompetent decisions."

The direct managers are effected from this attitude and the pressure is reflected to the employees.\r\n\r\nwe were required to maintain a weekly plan of our work for the following 4-5 months  with estimation of effort for each task. However things were very dynamic and it's hard to know in advance how much time each task will span. Moreover it's hard to have estimation when you don't know the task in details yet.\r\n\r\nThe Weekly Status Updates should been sent to the whole division (~45 people) although many employees have nothing to do with my work in weekly resolution (and the vice versa- i don't have any interest with getting so much weekly updates). It caused unnecessary tension because some employees \"pumped up\" their weekly status and made it look like the others achieve much less.\r\n\r\nWhen someone worked from home/ had to leave early / had to come late/ took day off- then it was customary to send notice to the whole division (again, most of the 45 people are not affected with my work)\r\n\r\nThere are many meetings that just waste time.  For each problem managers set a meeting and expect to hear easy solutions, they don't get responsibility to their decisions that create the problems from the first place.\r\n\r\nPersonally i worked many hours to get over the mess created by the methodology of work that was decided by the managers. I didn't feel to get respect for it and it  didn't affected managers to accept my suggestions to change this methodology.\r\n\r\nNo need to mention that the \"birthday vacation\" and the \"7 year sabbatical\" are only gimmicks"

Managers run their own culture within their own teams, ethical or not.\r\n\r\nIf you're really, really lucky, you MIGHT get to work on a diverse team with friendly people that know how to collaborate in a positive manner.",
		"cons": "Reading all these ridiculous, overwhelmingly positive, one-liner reviews of Intel, a company that conducts itself like a soulless, unsympathetic dictatorial power, makes me sick to my stomach. You can't just look the other way and pretend not to notice the ethical violations of this company, simply because they are handing you a paycheck every two weeks. Get real.\r\n\r\nIntel is a company that maintains an unbelievably negative and dysfunctional work environment. Incompetent, lower-level managers consistently foster a negative and toxic environment of finger-pointing and blame. There is literally no teamwork or camaraderie, and you will consistently be blamed for falling short on certain assignments, regardless of whether or not you had the proper resources, documentation, or support to do your job at a high level. You might get paid relatively well, but it won't exactly be a \u201cGreat Place to Work,\u201d as Intel\u2019s clownish managers consistently claim that it is.\r\n\r\nLet me paraphrase to you some of the Lync messenger interactions I had with my manager on a regular basis:\r\n\r\n\u201cHi <employee>, looking for update here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHi <employee>, looking for update\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHello <employee>...I'm looking for an update here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHi <employee>...looking for update here...where is the update\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHi <employee>\u2026when can I expect an update\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is wrong with you? Drop what you\u2019re doing and give me update.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatever else you are working on\u2026CAN\u2019T THAT WAIT?!\u201d\r\n\r\nYou get the idea. Seriously, people, I\u2019m not even exaggerating here.\r\n\r\nYour manager won't even have the courtesy to ask whether you are stuck or struggling on any part of the project, and whether or not you need help from other designers or engineers. He or she might even \u201cyell\u201d at you through the Lync messenger, which is quite intimidating, isn\u2019t it? Everything is mostly just \u201cHi, looking for update here...\u201d What a rude and insensitive message to receive from your manager on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nWhat are we now, emotionless robots? Go figure.\r\n\r\nIn order to get ahead at Intel, you need to utilize the \u201cbuddy\u201d system to extreme effect and somehow become \u201cbuddy buddy\u201d with your manager. Otherwise, simply producing high-quality work will not be nearly enough to get you a promotion. Extreme politics are in effect at all times with this corporation.\r\n\r\nManagers will probably not care at all about work-life balance, and will expect employees to be slaves \u2013 even on the weekends. Managers mostly give off a negative and threatening vibe which make employees feel uncomfortable much of the time.\r\n\r\nIntel has virtually no quality control over the people they select for managerial positions. Most of its managers have pathetic leadership skills and are completely lacking in basic emotional intelligence. Moreover, managers use fear and intimidation tactics on a consistent basis to manipulate and control employees. Believe me, it's not even remotely fun to be on the receiving end of that type of treatment. When a dictatorial manager treats you as if he or she \u201cowns\u201d you, then you know this isn't a particularly \u201cGreat Place to Work.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat Place to Work.\u201d What a joke.\r\n\r\nIntel prides itself on diversity \u2013 yet, arguably, over 80% of the people at the company are Indian. When you step foot inside the SC12 cafeteria at their Santa Clara location, you literally feel like you are in India. Is this really diversity?\r\n\r\nDiversity doesn\u2019t mean having an overwhelming majority of people from one race/ethnicity/nationality that is DIFFERENT from Americans. Diversity means DIVERSITY \u2013 having a wide spectrum of people across ALL different races/ethnicities/nationalities. Last time I checked, having over 80% of the people working at your company from India is just like INDIA. Give me a break.\r\n\r\nBy the way \u2013 if you are an electrical engineer and fail to heed my advice by accepting a job offer at this trashy company \u2013 please BEWARE of the group MEM-IP (memory IP).\r\n\r\nSTAY AWAY FROM MEM-IP.\r\n\r\nThis is a junk group, which totally epitomizes the dysfunctional work environment at Intel. If you are a hardware engineer and enjoy working on memory technology, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GROUP. You will be sorely disappointed if they somehow trick you into joining their terrible team, which they unfortunately did with me. \r\n\r\nMEM-IP maintains a poisonous environment of finger-pointing and blame, and there is virtually no teamwork or camaraderie within this group. It\u2019s an absolutely terrible place to start off as a recent college graduate (RCG) trying to begin a career in hardware engineering. You will learn very little, since the documentation for all circuit designs are extremely poor and haphazardly written. It\u2019s almost as if circuit documents were written by a slacker in high school who doesn\u2019t even know proper English. Internal documentation and resources for this group are absolutely atrocious. \r\n\r\nMostly, you will be on your own, and will have to bear the brunt of the blame for all issues on your projects, even if management never puts you in a position to succeed. This group operates on a very selfish, \u201cevery man for himself\u201d basis. More experienced engineers (when not extremely busy dealing with their own problems) will oftentimes guide you in the wrong direction because they themselves won\u2019t be familiar with a particular design or simulation that you\u2019re working on. And \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 YOU will be blamed by management for going in the wrong direction on that particular project.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t even get me started on meetings \u2013 almost every meeting I was a part of in MEM-IP was essentially a forum for finger-pointing, blaming, and chewing out employees that made mistakes in the execution of their projects. In theory, a meeting should be for employees to work together in a friendly and collaborative manner to make progress and resolve issues. The reality is that meetings \u2013 whether in-person or online \u2013 are very poorly conducted at Intel, and a complete waste of time. Essentially, unethical supervisors or project managers take the reins in meetings and nitpick nonsensical issues, while blowing them completely out of proportion in order to identify so-called \u201cunderperforming\u201d members of the group. In meetings, people are regularly treated like crap for making honest mistakes. This is not my idea of a productive or collaborative meeting \u2013 this is a joke.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Intel as a business hasn\u2019t been particularly successful in recent years. PC sales are dwindling by the second, and being 10 years late to the mobile industry is an extremely poor reflection on management\u2019s performance in recent years \u2013 and we\u2019re not even talking about workplace environment or ethical issues over here. This is pure business.\r\n\r\nIntel is a joke.\r\n\r\nIntel is so much of a joke that it conducts itself like a university classroom. Do you know how employee performance is rated at Intel? Using a primitive bell-curve system \u2013 just like those used in university engineering courses.\r\n\r\nAre you kidding me? You rate employees on a bell-curve? What kind of archaic performance evaluation system is this? Are we taking Electromagnetics 101 at UCLA, or something? Give me a freaking break. Intel\u2019s entire performance evaluation system is predicated on constantly weeding out certain members of the workforce who don\u2019t live up to ridiculous and unrealistic expectations.\r\n\r\nThis means that if you work your butt off 12 hours a day, yet 95% of the other employees in your group are working 14 hours a day, you\u2019re screwed. You WILL be targeted \u2013 and ultimately fired. As simple as that. Remember, Intel\u2019s human resources (HR) department needs to maintain its unique quotas \u2013 no matter how valuable of an employee you might be. You may have the very best of intentions, but you will be treated like dirt all the way through \u2013 especially when they walk you out of that door for the very last time.\r\n\r\nIntel uses an archaic and unethical tool called a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) to target, isolate, and alienate those employees that they want to get rid of \u2013 regardless of whether they had performance issues or not. This is equivalent to putting a person in \u201cjail\u201d at work \u2013 an incredibly insulting, humiliating, dehumanizing, and demoralizing device which, again, targets and alienates certain employees that management doesn\u2019t like. This means that you had better be a goody two-shoes and never complain or speak out against incompetent managers/leaders \u2013 otherwise, most likely, you WILL be put on a CAP. Furthermore, managers will blatantly lie and provide false statements on a CAP document, just to make it seem like you had performance issues. You could be put on a CAP even if you were intentionally set up to fail. Are the vindictive managers at Intel really such cruel, cold-hearted people who are completely lacking in even a basic conscience? So much so that they would blatantly lie in order to cover up their own incompetence, and get rid of employees whom they perceive to be a threat to their own power? You\u2019d better believe it.\r\n\r\nIntel supposedly has an \u201cOpen Door Policy\u201d and a \u201cNo Retaliation Policy\u201d which seem to indicate that you can raise any concerns or issues with management, without worrying about retaliation against you. However, these policies are a complete joke and are just a smokescreen created by HR to lure unsuspecting employees into thinking they are safe from any retaliation by their manager. If you raise concerns about workplace issues, you will ABSOLUTELY be targeted and retaliated against. The \u201cOpen Door Policy\u201d and \u201cNo Retaliation Policy\u201d are complete BS. If they really were legitimate, why do you think the company still utilizes these insane, prehistoric CAPs?\r\n\r\nAgain, I emphasize, Intel really is a joke \u2013 both in the running of its business and its poor workplace environment. If you\u2019re an electrical engineer and you think that getting a job at Intel is somehow a dream scenario \u2013 think again. You will be highly disappointed when you go behind the scenes and see exactly how this messy, haphazard company operates. Don\u2019t blindly follow its recent ad campaign with Jim Parsons, star of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d and somehow get the wrong impression that Intel is some likable corporation. Remember, Jim Parsons doesn\u2019t work AT Intel \u2013 he only ACTS for its silly commercials.\r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and take your talents to any one of the other multitude of Silicon Valley companies that are not only on a positive growth trajectory, but also treat their employees with some semblance of decency, respect, and professionalism. Sure, there will always be some unpleasant managers and employees at any company, but these types of people are unfortunately WIDELY prevalent at Intel. And believe me, CEO Brian Krzanich isn\u2019t running down from his office on the 5th floor of the RNB building to tackle any ethical issues at the lower levels. He quite simply doesn\u2019t care \u2013 and has more \u201cimportant\u201d things to worry about, anyways \u2013 such as the state of his struggling business.\r\n\r\nSure, you might end up getting lucky and join a good, respectable group at Intel \u2013 of which there certainly are a few \u2013 but do you really want to take that chance when there are much better companies out there?\r\n\r\nIn summary \u2013 steer clear of Intel. This is an unethical and toxic corporation that runs on nothing but the \u201cbuddy\u201d system and extreme workplace politics. Intel is simply not the place to cultivate a lengthy, rewarding, or enjoyable engineering career."
