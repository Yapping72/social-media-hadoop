There is also profit sharing, bonuses, and other financial incentives which can add multiple thousands of dollars to your annual salary/wage.\r\n\r\n2) Employee performance isn't punitive in nature and meant to empower improvement through transparency - meaning that at every manager 1:1 session you're shown how you're doing and talk about it so there's no surprises at the end of the year review. \r\n\r\n3) There are employee resources for help if there are issues - like a warmline for staff to talk about work-related issues and come up with a plan with the warmline to help the issue(s) to improve.

It took me a week and a half to figure out who my manager was & my manager wasn't responsive when emailed. It took me weeks to figure out if I was supposed to be doing something, and when I ran out of tasks that I figured out, I've been trying desperately to make my own work since. I'm someone that thrives on staying busy, and this has been very hard for me. I have contacted everyone that I can think of, like HR and their Warmline, for help & so far change is not happening. Additionally:\r\n\r\n1) It's extremely difficult to get hired at Intel as they get their \"pick of the litter\" due to their reputation and name. It took me multiple years of applications to get in.\r\n\r\n2) Communication in general is very poor and I don't know enough to know who to report poor communication to or how/where to look to find answers.\r\n\r\n3) Intel's outsourced their general IT and HR to 3rd parties, and this has so far not only resulted in appalling customer service but leaves me with no avenues to report poor service to since they don't mention who they report to or what agency/agencies they are. \r\n\r\n4) You are completely on your own to figure out everything at Intel. No one tells you anything. \r\n\r\n5) Intel (for reasons I understand) is very abbreviation and acronym heavy, and unfortunately, the internal vocab definition site is extremely lacking, so most jargon goes over my head and I have no resources to help me understand them. \r\n\r\n6) Management appears to have no idea you even exist. I have no idea who my co-workers are as well.\r\n\r\n7) As a former contractor, this one bothers me a lot - there is definitely a caste system at Intel between the \"green badges\" (temps/contractors), \"ice blues\" (employees with a defined employment term), and the \"blues\" (employees). It's dreadful. I watch the \"green badges\" get yelled at and talked down to by the blue badges, and some people won't talk to you without you sharing the same badge color."}, {"review_title": "Rewarding environment but be willing to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "23 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Hillsboro, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Challenging and rewarding technical projects, get to work with cutting edge technology, company has a concern for culture and diversity", "cons": "Competitive industry, so work can get quite hectic at times"}, {"review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Pre-Silicon Validation and Verification Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You have opportunities to grow depending on the team", "cons": "The management keeps changing and is not very transparent"}, {"review_title": "Good place to start a career", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer(Internship) in Nizhniy Novgorod", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Technology, nice office, all for the people", "cons": "bureaucracy, there was no division of responsibilities"}, {"review_title": "Positive", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Human Resources Partner in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Company, positive experience for 10 years", "cons": "limited opportunities internally at present"}, {"review_title": "Learning opportunities", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Mar 2021", "job_title": "ASIC Design Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Learnt a lot as junior engineer", "cons": "Less total pay compensation and bonus"}], [{"review_title": "Ok", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Financial Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefity were fine and i appreciate that", "cons": "Working atmosphere requires improving, strong silosis."}, {"review_title": "good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Soc Design Engineer in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good in terms of opportunities, project wise and management.", "cons": "Little bit problem in work life balance.

There is also profit sharing, bonuses, and other financial incentives which can add multiple thousands of dollars to your annual salary/wage.\r\n\r\n2) Employee performance isn't punitive in nature and meant to empower improvement through transparency - meaning that at every manager 1:1 session you're shown how you're doing and talk about it so there's no surprises at the end of the year review. \r\n\r\n3) There are employee resources for help if there are issues - like a warmline for staff to talk about work-related issues and come up with a plan with the warmline to help the issue(s) to improve.

It took me a week and a half to figure out who my manager was & my manager wasn't responsive when emailed. It took me weeks to figure out if I was supposed to be doing something, and when I ran out of tasks that I figured out, I've been trying desperately to make my own work since. I'm someone that thrives on staying busy, and this has been very hard for me. I have contacted everyone that I can think of, like HR and their Warmline, for help & so far change is not happening. Additionally:\r\n\r\n1) It's extremely difficult to get hired at Intel as they get their \"pick of the litter\" due to their reputation and name. It took me multiple years of applications to get in.\r\n\r\n2) Communication in general is very poor and I don't know enough to know who to report poor communication to or how/where to look to find answers.\r\n\r\n3) Intel's outsourced their general IT and HR to 3rd parties, and this has so far not only resulted in appalling customer service but leaves me with no avenues to report poor service to since they don't mention who they report to or what agency/agencies they are. \r\n\r\n4) You are completely on your own to figure out everything at Intel. No one tells you anything. \r\n\r\n5) Intel (for reasons I understand) is very abbreviation and acronym heavy, and unfortunately, the internal vocab definition site is extremely lacking, so most jargon goes over my head and I have no resources to help me understand them. \r\n\r\n6) Management appears to have no idea you even exist. I have no idea who my co-workers are as well.\r\n\r\n7) As a former contractor, this one bothers me a lot - there is definitely a caste system at Intel between the \"green badges\" (temps/contractors), \"ice blues\" (employees with a defined employment term), and the \"blues\" (employees). It's dreadful.
