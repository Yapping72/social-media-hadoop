At one point the storage dept was projected to ship more silicon than Intel's CPUs which is crazy.",
		"cons": "red tape, tech growth a little muddled, IT laptop support still all Windows (hello, macOS and Linux laptops anyone), there are bad depts out there to make u miserable.\r\n\r\nThe storage dept got relocated to the Aloha campus, which is a campus where basically engineering growth (esp SW) dies because lets face it- the Jones Farm, Hawthorne Farm and Rhonler Acres is where all the RandD is happening and you are on your your own forgotten island at Aloha (Intel's first Oregon building).\r\n\r\nAlso, at the end of the day, if you really want a modern career in SW, you'll need to leave the company. Intel is not a SW company though there is SW work; however  it's really hard to find the latest and greatest SW opportunities at Intel. I started realizing the danger of me becoming obsolete in the SW industry when I attended a few external conferences.  I was also severely underpaid as a SW design engineer and had to get a few external offers (one I obviously eventually took) to prove to management what I thought I was worth was true, especially since I was doing the role of 1.5-2 heads (design + QA)."

He recently put in place a new process for defining who will be let go without communicating to the employees or the managers.  Many managers were blind sided by the changes and lost really good employees that they can never bring back in the door (again due to his changes) even if the employee actually was a really good employee without any issues and the management wanted to keep them.   Still using outdated process of forcing managers to meet defined percentiles, rather than allowing managers free reign to define how employees should be ranked.  Believes in giving 'benefits' over salary raises because benefits can vary year to year or be reduced/removed so people are under paid compared to industry standards.\r\n\r\nLong hours because you will have to work with other time zones and countries, especially with the management moving everything off shore."

Each change has been very small, but the net effect over the years has been to reduce the amount of annual bonuses by a significant amount.\r\n\r\nTo save money, Intel stopped allowing employees working holidays (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Labor Day, Memorial Day, 4th of July, New Year's Day etc.) to claim \"Holiday Worked\" on their electronic time card, meaning pay for working a holiday that used to be paid at time and a half is now paid at straight time.\r\n \r\nIntel refers to its pay and benefits package as \"T-Comp\" or Total Compensation.  Basic pay is designed to be  around the middle of the pack or lower than what you make at other companies.  In bad years, this keeps payroll costs to the company low, and in good years is supposed to allow employees to share in the profits they helped create.  But 2014 was one of the best year in the companies history, yet benefits were cut again."

I was quiet and I worked HARD and didn't toot my own horn for MANY years.

Hierarchical corp. structure and deep layers\r\nof middle management, some of whom are non-technical. \r\nFair amount of internal politics. Hard to get promoted beyond a grade level which leaves no option other than to look for jobs outside. Average\r\ncompensation (esp. in the bay area).  Low on stock rewards and the stock has barely moved up. Inconsistent hiring standards and nepotism in some teams, which often lead to bad hires who eventually rotate to other teams.

They are willing to help you if you ask for help.  They also like to hang out with you and tell you things they would not normally say to other full time employees.  Many technical projects are directly related to graduate school research projects and you can find wonderful results and even pick up a thesis topic at Intel.  You can also do many internships in many different groups and learn many skills that a normal employee won't be able to acquire.",
		"cons": "Grad technical interns typcially work fairly long hours and the projects are mostly off the critical path.  You usually do not work with many people and are only responsible for your supervisor.  How good your supervisor is determines how much you can learn in your internship and how good your internship experiences are.   Sometimes your supervisor might be very busy with his/her own project and the planning for you might be a little rought.  This is especially true if you are phd level graduate technical intern.  Then you will have to fight on your own to move the project forward and get a decent review.  The review is also up to the supervisor's preference and some never give the highest review at all."

Thing aren't perfect at Intel, but it's hard to argue with the technological and financial results this company has produced, and Intel's record in contributing to environmental, educational and community causes is impressive.  They keep paying me, I'm still having fun (most days).",

If you're not amongst the brightest in your class, be prepared to live in the middle of the bell curve, if you're lucky.

There is atyrannical regime in control of the Oregon development groups that is difficult if not impossible to work with, and embodies the worst arrogance that Intel is known for in the larger marketplace.  If you let it, Intel will take over your life."

They also offer help buying and selling homes. \nI have also enjoyed working with my sub-team and shift Group leader.  The cost for medical/dental is second to none.  I understand that each facility is slightly different but They have on-site gym, massage therapists, doctors, free fruit, free fountain drinks and coffee.  I am impressed with the safety culture, especially as it relates to office ergonomics.  They will get you set up with the ergo equipment that fits you best.

I am very happy to work at Intel.",

You'll still do the overtime, but as a salaried employee you will not be paid for it.  And don't let them tell you it is 24 month out of any 30 either, many hiring managers do not understand contracting, you'll lose out and have to take a full year away from Intel.  Intel does NOT respect talent and ICE is not a path to FTE.  They also use contractors to underpay talent- on average a contract at Intel is $10-$20/hr below market rate for upper scale employees."

Yep, wake up and open your computer at 02:00 AM, and then again at 04:00 AM happens. This is what an around the clock factory needs. You are never free of work and you have to be available at the company's provided phone and have your company's provided computer with you when you are the \"point of contact duty\" - about 1-2 days a week.\r\nThere is no pay for driving fare. If you're not using the company's transportation, you pay your own gas expenses. The minibus transportation is awful, they've put seats in commercial trucks and it breaks you back during the ride. Some destinations have buses and they are much more comfortable.\r\nPersonal promotion is declared to be about performance, but it is mostly given to \"yes men\" and the ones who are willing to do whatever it takes...\r\nPeople are constantly worried about their job, the number 1 private conversation subject for all the years I've been working there was whether there's a big employee layout  soon, or not. Worries makes most people become competitive, this generates \"job-security\" behaviors."

At one point the storage dept was projected to ship more silicon than Intel's CPUs which is crazy.",
		"cons": "red tape, tech growth a little muddled, IT laptop support still all Windows (hello, macOS and Linux laptops anyone), there are bad depts out there to make u miserable.\r\n\r\nThe storage dept got relocated to the Aloha campus, which is a campus where basically engineering growth (esp SW) dies because lets face it- the Jones Farm, Hawthorne Farm and Rhonler Acres is where all the RandD is happening and you are on your your own forgotten island at Aloha (Intel's first Oregon building).\r\n\r\nAlso, at the end of the day, if you really want a modern career in SW, you'll need to leave the company. Intel is not a SW company though there is SW work; however  it's really hard to find the latest and greatest SW opportunities at Intel. I started realizing the danger of me becoming obsolete in the SW industry when I attended a few external conferences.  I was also severely underpaid as a SW design engineer and had to get a few external offers (one I obviously eventually took) to prove to management what I thought I was worth was true, especially since I was doing the role of 1.5-2 heads (design + QA)."

He recently put in place a new process for defining who will be let go without communicating to the employees or the managers.  Many managers were blind sided by the changes and lost really good employees that they can never bring back in the door (again due to his changes) even if the employee actually was a really good employee without any issues and the management wanted to keep them.   Still using outdated process of forcing managers to meet defined percentiles, rather than allowing managers free reign to define how employees should be ranked.  Believes in giving 'benefits' over salary raises because benefits can vary year to year or be reduced/removed so people are under paid compared to industry standards.\r\n\r\nLong hours because you will have to work with other time zones and countries, especially with the management moving everything off shore."

Each change has been very small, but the net effect over the years has been to reduce the amount of annual bonuses by a significant amount.\r\n\r\nTo save money, Intel stopped allowing employees working holidays (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Labor Day, Memorial Day, 4th of July, New Year's Day etc.) to claim \"Holiday Worked\" on their electronic time card, meaning pay for working a holiday that used to be paid at time and a half is now paid at straight time.\r\n \r\nIntel refers to its pay and benefits package as \"T-Comp\" or Total Compensation.  Basic pay is designed to be  around the middle of the pack or lower than what you make at other companies.  In bad years, this keeps payroll costs to the company low, and in good years is supposed to allow employees to share in the profits they helped create.

Hard to get promoted beyond a grade level which leaves no option other than to look for jobs outside. Average\r\ncompensation (esp. in the bay area).  Low on stock rewards and the stock has barely moved up. Inconsistent hiring standards and nepotism in some teams, which often lead to bad hires who eventually rotate to other teams.  Cost-cutting and hiring freeze have become the norm. Some projects are kept floating for the sake of keeping people around."

They are willing to help you if you ask for help.  They also like to hang out with you and tell you things they would not normally say to other full time employees.  Many technical projects are directly related to graduate school research projects and you can find wonderful results and even pick up a thesis topic at Intel.  You can also do many internships in many different groups and learn many skills that a normal employee won't be able to acquire.",
		"cons": "Grad technical interns typcially work fairly long hours and the projects are mostly off the critical path.  You usually do not work with many people and are only responsible for your supervisor.  How good your supervisor is determines how much you can learn in your internship and how good your internship experiences are.   Sometimes your supervisor might be very busy with his/her own project and the planning for you might be a little rought.  This is especially true if you are phd level graduate technical intern.  Then you will have to fight on your own to move the project forward and get a decent review.  The review is also up to the supervisor's preference and some never give the highest review at all."

Thing aren't perfect at Intel, but it's hard to argue with the technological and financial results this company has produced, and Intel's record in contributing to environmental, educational and community causes is impressive.  They keep paying me, I'm still having fun (most days).",

If you're not amongst the brightest in your class, be prepared to live in the middle of the bell curve, if you're lucky.  Sometimes management has a hard time facing and/or telling the truth to themselves and the employees; it sometimes seems they are so wrapped up in marketing spin they can't see reality.  There is atyrannical regime in control of the Oregon development groups that is difficult if not impossible to work with, and embodies the worst arrogance that Intel is known for in the larger marketplace.  If you let it, Intel will take over your life."

They also offer help buying and selling homes. \nI have also enjoyed working with my sub-team and shift Group leader.  The cost for medical/dental is second to none.  I understand that each facility is slightly different but They have on-site gym, massage therapists, doctors, free fruit, free fountain drinks and coffee.  I am impressed with the safety culture, especially as it relates to office ergonomics.  They will get you set up with the ergo equipment that fits you best.

I am very happy to work at Intel.",

The growth can be relatively fast from joining grades to about a level above PhD grade. \n\nThe Oregon campus is actually a notch above other companies' technical campuses. \n\nThe non personnel resources are limitless.",
		"cons": "All happy families are alike but every unhappy family is unhappy in a different way. This applies to various groups at Intel. Some groups lack mandate, some direction, some leadership, some political space and some are back up plans, some are pure ambition of the managers, some are utopian and some dystopian and paranoid. Well that about sums why large parts of Intel underperform despite the pros above esp. With abundant materiel resources.\n\nThe absolute tip management lacks confidence and vision. Traditionally stifled innovation in the ecosystem. There are close to nil semiconductor venture funds partly because Intel does not support the ecosystem unlike cisco or apple. Intel is paying dearly for it , cause when the entire industry ran out of options there are no startups to Jumpstart new growth."
