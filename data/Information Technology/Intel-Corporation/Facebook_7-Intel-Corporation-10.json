I started out as a technician in the Fab and now work as an engineer in an IT Factory organization. I can say that I have had some great times and some miserable times at Intel over the many years. You may read some bad employee reviews about Intel here or at some Intel \"hate\" sites. Also, you may read some great reviews. I can truthfully say that they are all true, good or bad. \r\n\r\nIntel is a huge company that spans the entire globe and is divided into hundreds and hundreds of departments that are further broken down into smaller teams or groups. Each of these teams or groups are manged by individual managers often referred to as GL's (Group Leaders) who have their own management style. There are also other layers of management for technicians etc., but too complex to explain here. The point I'm getting to here with this explanation is that the \"Intel\" experience for each individual employee depends heavily on their manager. Each manager fosters/creates the culture that exists within each team or group. I've had some managers that did not have a clue how to treat people with respect or appreciate the hard work or contributions that individuals or teams would make. There were some managers that did not even have a degree or even experience managing people. In my opinion they belonged working scrapping gum off the pavement under some bridge and they probably could not even do that right.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I have had some great managers that even turned into personal friends. I have had managers that were visionaries and great leaders that recognized and truly appreciated the work their team performed. Other managers I've had were OK and did a good job and let you do your work without bothering you or trying to \"micro-manage\" your tasks. Some managers I've had were clueless and you could probably not even come to work for a few days or tag on an extra week vacation and they would not even know you were gone. Some managers I've had would \"work from home\" also known as WFM. You would go by their cubes and there would be notes on their white boards from a week ago that they did not even erase yet as they obviously were not in to work as they were suppose to be.  \r\n\r\nAs you can see there is a very wide span in management skills, integrity and capability. I did not even start with other employees yet. There are some that are nothing but brown nosers looking to get on the good side of management in preparation for the infamous Intel R n R process also known as Ranking and Rating. Some employees are great and a pleasure to work with. Overall, most (90%) employees are easy going but beware some are out to back stab you every chance they get. \r\n\r\nThe key to surviving at Intel as I have for all these years and hopefully for more years to come is to know the system and use this to your favor. Any system can be defeated if you know how it really works. Intel is highly political and also highly technical this is the key. You have to be a politician and also technically sharp. This applies regardless of your job function; technician, engineer, manager, developer, marketing, etc. Always get to know your manager and fellow coworkers and adapt to each job role you are in. Don't compromise your own values or integrity but just  be wise and sharp at all times. When you find a manager and team that you feel are most like you personally, ride the wave! You can be very successful and be promoted very quickly. Managers often move around so beware of this also. \r\n\r\nOverall I give Intel 3.75 stars out of 5 as I feel Intel does not always pay fairly or treat people fairly and does not respect your time off from work. \r\n\r\nIntel has some good benefits, including:\r\n\r\n1. Five + different health insurance options\r\n\r\n2. An on site Health and Wellness Center with free yearly exams- they even give you $50 for completing their wellness exam\r\n\r\n3. Free unlimited drinks 24 hours a day including, tea, coffee, and soda, decent cafeteria with most meals costing about $5.\r\n\r\n4. Free fruit, apples, oranges, bananas, etc. But only one a day though...\r\n\r\n5. A vast discount program for many different local and national companies, including Dell, HP, Sony, etc.\r\n\r\n6. 401K contributions of about 8% of your gross pay. Not bad, you don't even need to contribute to get the money.\r\n\r\n7. An eight week paid sabbatical every seven years.\r\n\r\n8. About three weeks vacation a year plus holidays, more or less depending on years of service.\r\n\r\n9. Unlimited sick days for salary workers. Beware though as some managers will not like if you call in too much. You may also find yourself having to make up for the time off if you have project deadlnes...", "cons": "Every employee at Intel dreads the R n R process that must be done on a semi annual or annual basis (depending on the group and country, etc) for every single employee. The R n R process is suppose to reward the employee who has done more than just come to work and performed their job. I know this sounds crazy. You think- I come to work, work hard, show results, am productive and perform my best and I should get a raise. Well, Intel doesn't think so. This is the number one thing that I think should change and that also causes much distress and dissatisfaction among Intel employees especially engineers. The purpose behind the method used by Intel is to weed out the weak and poor performers who do not innovate or provide continuous improvement. So, what this means is that 40 hours a week at Intel is often not enough to please management. \r\n\r\nAs I stated above the pay at Intel is not always fair. Intel will often pay new workers off the street more than someone who has been working at Intel for years. I have often found myself training someone who had less experience than me yet they were making 10% more than I was...\r\n\r\n1. The ranking and rating process is a joke. Yet managers will swear on their grandmothers grave that it is fair. I have managers who are friends of mine tell me how it really works so I know the system very well. It is very subjective and relies heavily on human judgment and perception which is inherently flawed. As I said before get to know your manager and his or hers likes and dislikes and tread lightly.....\r\n\r\n2.

They're also pretty flexible about hours (I know quite a few people don't get into the office until 10am.)\r\n- Casual: jeans, t-shirt and running shoes is the standard\r\n- High level managers give quarterly business and division update meetings so everyone gets insight into how their job fits into the big picture and has an understanding of the markets and initiatives.\r\n- Unique/Good benefits:\r\n      - Stock Purchase Plan lets you put up to 2-5% of your paycheck into an account that buys you intel stock, discounted at 15% once every 6 months.\r\n      - The 3 (4 weeks if you've worked there for 10+ years) of vacation time is a \"recommendation\" not a hard and fast limit.

This means there are some really bad engineers/managers that just hide out in the company or managers that run their groups like weird little \"fiefdoms\" (another employee's word) with their own values (or lack there of) and policies.\r\n- Here's another policy that blows: you find a job on the internal jobs website and apply for it, your manager gets an email immediately informing them that you are job shopping. \r\n- A lot of the newer leadership has business rather than engineering background, but the ones that do have the technical background are AWESOME.\r\n- Casual: jeans, t-shirt and running shoes is the standard - this was on the pro's list too... it is awesome most of the time, but for those of you that like dressing up for work or feel more professional/productive when you wear slacks or business casual, prepare to feel very slouchy all the time. A lot of times dressing nice will result in everyone asking you if you have an interview today.\r\n-  Lack of communication across different groups  \r\n- Performance Reviews (called \"Focal\") can be really unfair. Every employee in a group is compared by grade-level then rewarded (or punished) on a bell curve. If your whole group is solid, someone still has to get the bad grade. The bad grade makes for extra work and sometimes ties you down to your group longer.\r\n- Hire & Fire tendencies. Intel goes through swings where they need hardware engineers or they'll just die so they hire a ton then realize a year later than they don't need half those people any more. Then they'll go on a software engineer hiring binge then lay them all off again when they realize they hired too many. Some business groups are better at this and Intel as a whole is getting better, but it still happens sometimes.\r\n- Intel's values are all listed on the back of employee badges. One of these is \"properly staff and fund projects\" - not a chance on that one. Most of the groups I know of are understaffed, under a serious time crunch all the time and are constantly being evaluated about what they're billing.\r\n- I had a 1:1 with a pretty senior person last week, he said \"this company's a bunch of ***holes, you have to have a pretty thick skin to survive here\". I've found that to be true some of the time.

In some ways that's good, such as his willingness to be more pragmatic in which markets we go after, but in other ways it's a real concern.  There is a feeling in the company that I come across nearly every day that BK doesn't really care about normal employees.  This was especially evident after the most recent layoff.  People that were rated successful but given slightly less stock were laid off and told they could never come back.  Their direct managers had no say in the matter.  It came down from corporate.  It didn't make sense to most employees but BK didn't seem to understand that at all.  This was especially evident in the employee face to face where he basically said they plan to do such things again in the future and he thought it was a good thing.  It makes you think that we're going to continue to see actions that come across as heartless.  There is especially a concern among more experienced engineers that Intel will find a way to get rid of them by 50.  It seems to be part of the system.  The last thing that is hard for a lot of people is the new diversity push.  If you are in a diverse workgroup (technical female, black, hispanic, native american) it is great.  But for whites, indians, and asian males it's seen as a real frustration.  Whether in external hiring, or internal promotions Intel has shifted to a very discriminatory culture.  It's done in the name of trying to overcome unintended bias but it seems to be overkill and has a really negative effect on the vast majority of employees.  In the past, we tried to always ensure our hiring pool was diverse, but we chose the best candidate.  That is changing.  It's more about making sure we get a certain percentage of diversity in gender and skin color than hiring the best person for the job.  That bothers a lot of people in the company and causes us to be slower because we're not always getting the right skill sets on the project.  One thing that is ironic, is that rather than hiring African Americans or Hispanic Americans, they tend to hire Africans or South Americans.  Foreigners that are going to school in the US just like their Chinese and Indian counterparts.  The difference is the color of their skin.  Many times these are great people, but it is ironic that we claim to be trying to help those in the US that are underrepresented but instead we just hire people from overseas that look more like them.  So, if you fall into one of these categories, it is probably a really good time to join Intel.  There will be more opportunities for you there than potentially any other company.

An 8-week sabbatical every 7 years for all full time employees is terrific and seems about right timing-wise, because most employees are entirely burned out by then and need a break.  Senior leadership is very strong at Intel -- what I would consider true vision-generating leaders. And the open-door polocy to talk with any of them is real. Not quite so with first-line managers (see below).  When faced with mid year or year-end layoffs (see below) Intel does a terrific job of offering very fair and beneficial separation packages, rather than just walking the poor individual to the door with a cardboard box of cubicle pics and mementos. Generally, the employee is given a 3-month notice that he or she will be going into a \"pool\" and then an HR specialist is assigned to help the individual find another like-job somewhere else in the company. I would say this is successful maybe 50% of the time. If the employee decides just to leave then and not look for another internal job, the separation package  typically ammounts to 1-month for every year worked in exit pay, plus other benefits such as extendede insurance coverage etc. Layoffs and department cutbacks do frequently occur, but In my opinion, Intel does a very good job of helping exiting employees if that time does come.", "cons": "No work/life balance no matter how much Intel tries to tout their improvements here. Intel's demands and expectations on their employees' time is still extremely high. Seriously... on-the-job heart attacks are commonplace with the stress of getting product developed and out the door. Intel has a very old workforce with more than 50% of their US-based employees qualified for retirement. The various HR programs and overall emphasis is on hiring NCGs suggests that Intel is really wanting to replace the old guard with new younger (less expensive) blood. It's really a young man's world at Intel and getting more so every month. While senior leadership at Intel is very good in my opinion, the 1st line managers are generally groomed and trained to be tough results-only intimidation driven supervisors. Unfortunately, there is a very common and very strongly adheared-to year-end review policy for managers to promote only the top 5% at year end, give average reviews with near-zero raises to 80% of the team, and run the bottom 15% out the door. These are forced numbers that are very serious, and managers who don't hit them are really put under the microscope.  If the team is all extremely good with nothing but top performers, there will still be a 10% - 15% out-the-door move. Perhaps this is also true at most other companies; I don't know as I've been here for 22 years. But every 6 months I see an aweful lot of great talent walking out the door.  Overall career opportunities are there, but only for those who work extremely hard to get noticed, contribute, and are quite frankly good at office politics. You also neet to be very flexible and willing to take job location moves at the drop of a hat.  Thinking you can progress succcessful at Intel while staying at the same geographical location your entire career (or even 3 to 5 years for that matter) is unrealistic. Nobody at Intel will help you with your career, and with all the top-petigreed talent around, it's quite frankly very tough to complete. There is a reason Andy Grove founded Intel on an \"Only the Paranoid Survive\" philosophy. It's as true today as it was when I started at Intel.

Contributions outweigh mere seniority.\r\n\r\n* Employees are treated very well - amenities, benefits, career development and training, HR oversight of managers, consistency of policy application, work/life balance are all very good for a manufacturing company. Pay is always a little below the best, but company and personal performance bonuses more than make up for it.\r\n\r\n* The company fights through seemingly impossible market and industry challenges and succeeds - over and over. Even when they weren't there first, when they do attack something they do it with everything they've got.\r\n\r\n* Intel is a huge company, and they actively encourage and facilitate employees to move around between the business units and job functions (but not so much between locations) as part of their career development.\r\n\r\n* Intel can be a great place to work, but you have to do most of the work to make it that way.", "cons": "* Meritocracy is easily manipulated - if you are good at managing your manager and getting \"visibility\" that you can dress up as superior results, you'll usually get away with it because likely as not your manager is a generalist who doesn't know much about the actual work you're supposed to be doing. Also, seniority counts for nothing, and as the years go by you'll be pressed very hard to be better, faster and more current than the most recent 25-year old MBA grad they just hired.\r\n\r\n* Employees are treated like hamsters on the wheel. Last year's contributions were great, but what are doing to improve on that this year? Right before performance reviews everyone scrambles to get superficial \"wins\" to dress up the annual assessment, and it works.\r\n\r\n* The company can't change at the bottom as fast as management at the top thinks it can. Then, when they don't see the movement they're looking for, they tend to make over-corrections. What they don't realize, however, is that the middle management has been shining them on about implementing the first round of changes (see \"advice\" section).\r\n\r\n* Many people spend more time internally networking and job jumping than actually contributing; somehow senior management allows itself to get taken advantage of in that way. \r\n\r\n* Intel can be a great place to work, but you have to do most of the work to make it that way."}, {"review_title": "Engineer Technician", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "21 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Engineer Technician in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great compensation while working there.

Made some lifelong friendships.\r\n\r\nIntel sent me on several trips to conferences and visit other sites around the world.  It was a lot of fun.", "cons": "I worked on a software team at Intel and after 8 years and several projects I can claim that Intel doesn't know how to do software!  There is little appetite to get better at improving any, all aspects of building software like professionals.  Sure the company pays lip service, but does not follow through with meaningful changes.  If you want to build software like a professional, look for a career elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe focal review system is stupid and incredibly unfair.  If you speak out against your team's behavior or practices, expect to get noticed by your first or second line manager and punished at focal time.  You can contest your treatment, but because your fate was determined by all of the managers horse trading for the limited resources to give out every year, you can't effectively refute the unsubstantiated claims.  In short, you have to play the political game well and often.\r\n\r\nRecognition is sporadic and arbitrary.  Early on I received a Division Recognition for setting up a server for the org to use.  My team, who didn't help on the project, and I all received the award.  However, later when we achieved something much more significant, nothing.  We even mentioned this to management, but still nothing.\r\n\r\nHiring is broken at Intel.  The one time, out of 8 tries, that we hired someone on our team was when every member of the team said, don't hire this person.  However, the manager did anyway because it was perceived that we would lose the req and this person could plug one hole on our team.  It was a disaster.  The person never did more than the one thing, did not even do that well and brought negative attention to our team within the org.  Furthermore, when we asked for additional headcount to meet our commitments, the headcount we had including this person, was always used against us.\r\n\r\nThere is often pressure to hire whomever you can, whichever resume you have in front of you now, because the req can close at any time.  This wasn't an irrational fear either.  Many times we would be moving through the process, only to have Intel Corporate to come through and set a hiring freeze.  This is stupid.  It should be that if the team has been given permission, headcount, to hire, that they should be exempt from these hiring freezes, at least for 45 days or something.  However, it is not like that and the unintended side effect is that teams will hire substandard candidates just to fill some headcount.  Do that several times and the org is infected with wrong people.\r\n\r\nAnother problem with hiring is the equity and diversity push Intel is making.  I am all for hiring diversity but not at the cost of talent and productivity.  Make every effort to get the diverse candidates into the pool of applicants.  However, now Intel will hire some non-white tech female(for example) and tell an org you can have this person for free, won't tally against your headcount, if you can find some place to put her.  This is not how you build a strong capable team.  To do that, you need to find as many candidates as possible, interview them and take the strongest person regardless of race or sex.  I understand there is discrimination.  However, I think engineers are quite often interested in grabbing the person that helps their team and their cause the most.\r\n\r\nThe way Intel handled this last round of layoffs was dishonest, stupid and damaging.  At focal every year your manager can affect two items, your rating and your stock bonus.  Performance is supposed to be reflected in your rating, NOT your stocks.  However, this year (June 2015) Intel decided to use the stocks as another metric to trim some employees.  Intel made several acquisitions of companies and apparently didn't like carrying over 100,000 employees world wide.  So they used the stocks.  So people with a \"Successful\" rating with the lowest stocks, Stock Level 4, twice in the last 4 years were let go.  The problem with this is that it is unfair and managers gave SL4 to their employees for a variety of reasons.  For example, quality is an adjunct function at Intel and so managers often gave the better stocks to their direct employees rather than the quality contingent attached to their team.  What was the result, the quality teams at Intel had huge loses.  I guess it's all for the best.  Quality concerns at Intel were always an afterthought.\r\n\r\nIntel is a very conservative, Republican-like company.  That doesn't show up until Intel comes out AGAINST Net Neutrality.  In Portland, the company stance is particularly incongruous with the workers who work there, largely a liberal population.  To argue that internet connectivity is not as fundamental a utility as telephone was back in the day is being dishonest.  I understand that companies like Intel and IBM can draw straight lines from blocking Net Neutrality today to profitable sales for their companies, but we want leadership and principles from our company.  \r\n\r\nSadly, Intel is not a company with principles.  We have to take web-based training every year for ethics, etc.  Yet, Intel's upper management has landed us in court case after court case over the years for their unethical behavior.  Look it up if you;'re interested. \r\n\r\nFinally, a lot is said about work-life balance.  It is true that you can work a normal 9-5 type shift and survive at Intel.  However, I have never seen that behavior from those on the rise.  Everyone that has ever advanced at Intel has worked their butt off with 50 and 60 hour work weeks for years, including me.  That is the only way to get ahead, and everyone knows it, if doesn't admit it aloud."}], [{"review_title": "Great if you're on the right team", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Software Analytics Engineer in Hillsboro, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Intel is a great place to work.

I should also note that while the pay is decent for a tech company, it is extremely lacking for a top-tier tech company. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Nvidia and others pay significantly more; and the CEO practically brags about about getting a good deal by short changing the employees (they deliberately aim to be average pay, and have no intent of being above average).\r\n\r\nThere is also an extreme divide between engineering and non-engineering disciplines with different standards, expectations, and perceived value.

These skills are invaluable, and believe it or not, not all CPU companies have mastered these basics, and is what I think makes Intel  CPU's dominant in their respective markets.\r\n\r\nFrom 1997 to when I left, had a lot of opportunities make my own mark. Unfortunately, because of the cons, the XScale business was jettisoned and before I left I was absorbed into the x86 part of the business which was different.\r\n\r\nI did get promoted twice, and I'm a minority. However, I did work like the dickens for it, and never did make it to the the Staff level, which at the time seems to be the point at which you were taken seriously at Intel.\r\n\r\nBack in the 1990's the stock options and bonuses were grea. After 2000, they became worthless.  Intel has sinced switched over to RSU's, which are a surer thing, though with less upside.  I don't see Intel as the rip-roaring growth company so I think this was a good move to keep people satisfied.  Intel put about 12% of your pay into your 401K (SERP). It was reduced to 8% when I left. Still a great benefit\r\n\r\nBase salary was below average. During hard times we skipped FOCAL raises. Before I left", "cons": "For the first 3-4 years I was there, I worked on average 10 hours a day. For a first generation new product I worked about 13-15 hours a day for 5 months straight, as did about 5 others. The one manager who did that with his underling no longer works for the company. Not only was he smart but was a good leader.  A loss for Intel, IMHO.\r\n\r\nCulture is different from one group to the next and changed over time.  Intel's culture is based on Andy Grove's management style.  Confrontational (constructive), and aggressive.  Intel thinks itself egalitarian, but over time has become less so. Now, a  level 3 engineer confronting a staff engineer (level 8) is a very dangerous thing, even if the level 3 engineer is right--which is not an impossibility. Ever hear of a Pyrrhic victory?\r\n\r\nThe FOCAL process is not uniform, and can be overly harsh. I transfered to a department that wanted to promote me based on my prior FOCAL but couldn't because my former manager refused to recommend me for a promotion--probably sour grapes despite my documented performance but there was nothing that could be done.  I was given an unsatisfactory review (and this after being promoted to level 7) because I reported a staff engineer (level 8) who was upset that I reported him for verbally dressing me down on Microsoft Communicator ( internet chat). Imagine that: he sent me nice little barbs over the 'net and acts surprised that I didn't report him.  My manager was given a bad review, too, when he confronted (constructively) him regarding this issue. This guy must have had major pull (remember my egalitarian statement?)\r\n\r\nIntel is known as a great place to work in the Asian community, and I hear Asians really help each other out there and have a much better experience than other groups. This is from first hand knowledge talking with Asian engineers working in the same difficult groups I worked in, and calling them great with lots of support from peers.\r\n\r\nEngineers can't get along, and clique up pretty hard. I think some strategic moves made by Intel flamed out partly because of cliques that could not get along, and the unfortunate folks caught in cross fire.\r\n\r\nMy advice. Get in. Learn the basics. Get a promotion to verify you know the basics. Then find a gig at a smaller company or statup where people are real. Intel is a great place to have worked. I say you should see a promotion in 3 years, else you're doing something wrong, or being put on the list to be CAP'ed out."}, {"review_title": "Each group at intel is a different company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Mar 2010", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Santa Clara, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.

I started out as a technician in the Fab and now work as an engineer in an IT Factory organization. I can say that I have had some great times and some miserable times at Intel over the many years. You may read some bad employee reviews about Intel here or at some Intel \"hate\" sites. Also, you may read some great reviews. I can truthfully say that they are all true, good or bad. \r\n\r\nIntel is a huge company that spans the entire globe and is divided into hundreds and hundreds of departments that are further broken down into smaller teams or groups. Each of these teams or groups are manged by individual managers often referred to as GL's (Group Leaders) who have their own management style. There are also other layers of management for technicians etc., but too complex to explain here. The point I'm getting to here with this explanation is that the \"Intel\" experience for each individual employee depends heavily on their manager. Each manager fosters/creates the culture that exists within each team or group. I've had some managers that did not have a clue how to treat people with respect or appreciate the hard work or contributions that individuals or teams would make. There were some managers that did not even have a degree or even experience managing people. In my opinion they belonged working scrapping gum off the pavement under some bridge and they probably could not even do that right.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I have had some great managers that even turned into personal friends. I have had managers that were visionaries and great leaders that recognized and truly appreciated the work their team performed. Other managers I've had were OK and did a good job and let you do your work without bothering you or trying to \"micro-manage\" your tasks. Some managers I've had were clueless and you could probably not even come to work for a few days or tag on an extra week vacation and they would not even know you were gone. Some managers I've had would \"work from home\" also known as WFM. You would go by their cubes and there would be notes on their white boards from a week ago that they did not even erase yet as they obviously were not in to work as they were suppose to be.  \r\n\r\nAs you can see there is a very wide span in management skills, integrity and capability. I did not even start with other employees yet. There are some that are nothing but brown nosers looking to get on the good side of management in preparation for the infamous Intel R n R process also known as Ranking and Rating. Some employees are great and a pleasure to work with. Overall, most (90%) employees are easy going but beware some are out to back stab you every chance they get. \r\n\r\nThe key to surviving at Intel as I have for all these years and hopefully for more years to come is to know the system and use this to your favor. Any system can be defeated if you know how it really works. Intel is highly political and also highly technical this is the key. You have to be a politician and also technically sharp. This applies regardless of your job function; technician, engineer, manager, developer, marketing, etc. Always get to know your manager and fellow coworkers and adapt to each job role you are in. Don't compromise your own values or integrity but just  be wise and sharp at all times. When you find a manager and team that you feel are most like you personally, ride the wave! You can be very successful and be promoted very quickly. Managers often move around so beware of this also. \r\n\r\nOverall I give Intel 3.75 stars out of 5 as I feel Intel does not always pay fairly or treat people fairly and does not respect your time off from work. \r\n\r\nIntel has some good benefits, including:\r\n\r\n1. Five + different health insurance options\r\n\r\n2. An on site Health and Wellness Center with free yearly exams- they even give you $50 for completing their wellness exam\r\n\r\n3. Free unlimited drinks 24 hours a day including, tea, coffee, and soda, decent cafeteria with most meals costing about $5.\r\n\r\n4. Free fruit, apples, oranges, bananas, etc. But only one a day though...\r\n\r\n5. A vast discount program for many different local and national companies, including Dell, HP, Sony, etc.\r\n\r\n6. 401K contributions of about 8% of your gross pay. Not bad, you don't even need to contribute to get the money.\r\n\r\n7. An eight week paid sabbatical every seven years.\r\n\r\n8. About three weeks vacation a year plus holidays, more or less depending on years of service.\r\n\r\n9. Unlimited sick days for salary workers. Beware though as some managers will not like if you call in too much. You may also find yourself having to make up for the time off if you have project deadlnes...", "cons": "Every employee at Intel dreads the R n R process that must be done on a semi annual or annual basis (depending on the group and country, etc) for every single employee. The R n R process is suppose to reward the employee who has done more than just come to work and performed their job. I know this sounds crazy. You think- I come to work, work hard, show results, am productive and perform my best and I should get a raise. Well, Intel doesn't think so. This is the number one thing that I think should change and that also causes much distress and dissatisfaction among Intel employees especially engineers. The purpose behind the method used by Intel is to weed out the weak and poor performers who do not innovate or provide continuous improvement. So, what this means is that 40 hours a week at Intel is often not enough to please management. \r\n\r\nAs I stated above the pay at Intel is not always fair. Intel will often pay new workers off the street more than someone who has been working at Intel for years. I have often found myself training someone who had less experience than me yet they were making 10% more than I was...\r\n\r\n1. The ranking and rating process is a joke. Yet managers will swear on their grandmothers grave that it is fair. I have managers who are friends of mine tell me how it really works so I know the system very well. It is very subjective and relies heavily on human judgment and perception which is inherently flawed. As I said before get to know your manager and his or hers likes and dislikes and tread lightly.....\r\n\r\n2.

They're also pretty flexible about hours (I know quite a few people don't get into the office until 10am.)\r\n- Casual: jeans, t-shirt and running shoes is the standard\r\n- High level managers give quarterly business and division update meetings so everyone gets insight into how their job fits into the big picture and has an understanding of the markets and initiatives.\r\n- Unique/Good benefits:\r\n      - Stock Purchase Plan lets you put up to 2-5% of your paycheck into an account that buys you intel stock, discounted at 15% once every 6 months.\r\n      - The 3 (4 weeks if you've worked there for 10+ years) of vacation time is a \"recommendation\" not a hard and fast limit.

This means there are some really bad engineers/managers that just hide out in the company or managers that run their groups like weird little \"fiefdoms\" (another employee's word) with their own values (or lack there of) and policies.\r\n- Here's another policy that blows: you find a job on the internal jobs website and apply for it, your manager gets an email immediately informing them that you are job shopping. \r\n- A lot of the newer leadership has business rather than engineering background, but the ones that do have the technical background are AWESOME.\r\n- Casual: jeans, t-shirt and running shoes is the standard - this was on the pro's list too... it is awesome most of the time, but for those of you that like dressing up for work or feel more professional/productive when you wear slacks or business casual, prepare to feel very slouchy all the time. A lot of times dressing nice will result in everyone asking you if you have an interview today.\r\n-  Lack of communication across different groups  \r\n- Performance Reviews (called \"Focal\") can be really unfair. Every employee in a group is compared by grade-level then rewarded (or punished) on a bell curve. If your whole group is solid, someone still has to get the bad grade. The bad grade makes for extra work and sometimes ties you down to your group longer.\r\n- Hire & Fire tendencies. Intel goes through swings where they need hardware engineers or they'll just die so they hire a ton then realize a year later than they don't need half those people any more. Then they'll go on a software engineer hiring binge then lay them all off again when they realize they hired too many. Some business groups are better at this and Intel as a whole is getting better, but it still happens sometimes.\r\n- Intel's values are all listed on the back of employee badges. One of these is \"properly staff and fund projects\" - not a chance on that one. Most of the groups I know of are understaffed, under a serious time crunch all the time and are constantly being evaluated about what they're billing.\r\n- I had a 1:1 with a pretty senior person last week, he said \"this company's a bunch of ***holes, you have to have a pretty thick skin to survive here\". I've found that to be true some of the time.

In some ways that's good, such as his willingness to be more pragmatic in which markets we go after, but in other ways it's a real concern.  There is a feeling in the company that I come across nearly every day that BK doesn't really care about normal employees.  This was especially evident after the most recent layoff.  People that were rated successful but given slightly less stock were laid off and told they could never come back.  Their direct managers had no say in the matter.  It came down from corporate.  It didn't make sense to most employees but BK didn't seem to understand that at all.  This was especially evident in the employee face to face where he basically said they plan to do such things again in the future and he thought it was a good thing.  It makes you think that we're going to continue to see actions that come across as heartless.  There is especially a concern among more experienced engineers that Intel will find a way to get rid of them by 50.  It seems to be part of the system.  The last thing that is hard for a lot of people is the new diversity push.  If you are in a diverse workgroup (technical female, black, hispanic, native american) it is great.  But for whites, indians, and asian males it's seen as a real frustration.  Whether in external hiring, or internal promotions Intel has shifted to a very discriminatory culture.  It's done in the name of trying to overcome unintended bias but it seems to be overkill and has a really negative effect on the vast majority of employees.  In the past, we tried to always ensure our hiring pool was diverse, but we chose the best candidate.  That is changing.  It's more about making sure we get a certain percentage of diversity in gender and skin color than hiring the best person for the job.  That bothers a lot of people in the company and causes us to be slower because we're not always getting the right skill sets on the project.  One thing that is ironic, is that rather than hiring African Americans or Hispanic Americans, they tend to hire Africans or South Americans.  Foreigners that are going to school in the US just like their Chinese and Indian counterparts.  The difference is the color of their skin.  Many times these are great people, but it is ironic that we claim to be trying to help those in the US that are underrepresented but instead we just hire people from overseas that look more like them.  So, if you fall into one of these categories, it is probably a really good time to join Intel.  There will be more opportunities for you there than potentially any other company.

An 8-week sabbatical every 7 years for all full time employees is terrific and seems about right timing-wise, because most employees are entirely burned out by then and need a break.  Senior leadership is very strong at Intel -- what I would consider true vision-generating leaders. And the open-door polocy to talk with any of them is real. Not quite so with first-line managers (see below).  When faced with mid year or year-end layoffs (see below) Intel does a terrific job of offering very fair and beneficial separation packages, rather than just walking the poor individual to the door with a cardboard box of cubicle pics and mementos. Generally, the employee is given a 3-month notice that he or she will be going into a \"pool\" and then an HR specialist is assigned to help the individual find another like-job somewhere else in the company. I would say this is successful maybe 50% of the time. If the employee decides just to leave then and not look for another internal job, the separation package  typically ammounts to 1-month for every year worked in exit pay, plus other benefits such as extendede insurance coverage etc. Layoffs and department cutbacks do frequently occur, but In my opinion, Intel does a very good job of helping exiting employees if that time does come.", "cons": "No work/life balance no matter how much Intel tries to tout their improvements here. Intel's demands and expectations on their employees' time is still extremely high. Seriously... on-the-job heart attacks are commonplace with the stress of getting product developed and out the door. Intel has a very old workforce with more than 50% of their US-based employees qualified for retirement. The various HR programs and overall emphasis is on hiring NCGs suggests that Intel is really wanting to replace the old guard with new younger (less expensive) blood. It's really a young man's world at Intel and getting more so every month. While senior leadership at Intel is very good in my opinion, the 1st line managers are generally groomed and trained to be tough results-only intimidation driven supervisors. Unfortunately, there is a very common and very strongly adheared-to year-end review policy for managers to promote only the top 5% at year end, give average reviews with near-zero raises to 80% of the team, and run the bottom 15% out the door. These are forced numbers that are very serious, and managers who don't hit them are really put under the microscope.  If the team is all extremely good with nothing but top performers, there will still be a 10% - 15% out-the-door move. Perhaps this is also true at most other companies; I don't know as I've been here for 22 years. But every 6 months I see an aweful lot of great talent walking out the door.  Overall career opportunities are there, but only for those who work extremely hard to get noticed, contribute, and are quite frankly good at office politics. You also neet to be very flexible and willing to take job location moves at the drop of a hat.  Thinking you can progress succcessful at Intel while staying at the same geographical location your entire career (or even 3 to 5 years for that matter) is unrealistic. Nobody at Intel will help you with your career, and with all the top-petigreed talent around, it's quite frankly very tough to complete. There is a reason Andy Grove founded Intel on an \"Only the Paranoid Survive\" philosophy. It's as true today as it was when I started at Intel.

Even when they weren't there first, when they do attack something they do it with everything they've got.\r\n\r\n* Intel is a huge company, and they actively encourage and facilitate employees to move around between the business units and job functions (but not so much between locations) as part of their career development.\r\n\r\n* Intel can be a great place to work, but you have to do most of the work to make it that way.", "cons": "* Meritocracy is easily manipulated - if you are good at managing your manager and getting \"visibility\" that you can dress up as superior results, you'll usually get away with it because likely as not your manager is a generalist who doesn't know much about the actual work you're supposed to be doing. Also, seniority counts for nothing, and as the years go by you'll be pressed very hard to be better, faster and more current than the most recent 25-year old MBA grad they just hired.\r\n\r\n* Employees are treated like hamsters on the wheel. Last year's contributions were great, but what are doing to improve on that this year? Right before performance reviews everyone scrambles to get superficial \"wins\" to dress up the annual assessment, and it works.\r\n\r\n* The company can't change at the bottom as fast as management at the top thinks it can. Then, when they don't see the movement they're looking for, they tend to make over-corrections. What they don't realize, however, is that the middle management has been shining them on about implementing the first round of changes (see \"advice\" section).\r\n\r\n* Many people spend more time internally networking and job jumping than actually contributing; somehow senior management allows itself to get taken advantage of in that way. \r\n\r\n* Intel can be a great place to work, but you have to do most of the work to make it that way."}, {"review_title": "Engineer Technician", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "21 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Engineer Technician in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great compensation while working there.

Made some lifelong friendships.\r\n\r\nIntel sent me on several trips to conferences and visit other sites around the world.  It was a lot of fun.", "cons": "I worked on a software team at Intel and after 8 years and several projects I can claim that Intel doesn't know how to do software!  There is little appetite to get better at improving any, all aspects of building software like professionals.  Sure the company pays lip service, but does not follow through with meaningful changes.  If you want to build software like a professional, look for a career elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe focal review system is stupid and incredibly unfair.  If you speak out against your team's behavior or practices, expect to get noticed by your first or second line manager and punished at focal time.  You can contest your treatment, but because your fate was determined by all of the managers horse trading for the limited resources to give out every year, you can't effectively refute the unsubstantiated claims.  In short, you have to play the political game well and often.\r\n\r\nRecognition is sporadic and arbitrary.  Early on I received a Division Recognition for setting up a server for the org to use.  My team, who didn't help on the project, and I all received the award.  However, later when we achieved something much more significant, nothing.  We even mentioned this to management, but still nothing.\r\n\r\nHiring is broken at Intel.  The one time, out of 8 tries, that we hired someone on our team was when every member of the team said, don't hire this person.  However, the manager did anyway because it was perceived that we would lose the req and this person could plug one hole on our team.  It was a disaster.  The person never did more than the one thing, did not even do that well and brought negative attention to our team within the org.  Furthermore, when we asked for additional headcount to meet our commitments, the headcount we had including this person, was always used against us.\r\n\r\nThere is often pressure to hire whomever you can, whichever resume you have in front of you now, because the req can close at any time.  This wasn't an irrational fear either.  Many times we would be moving through the process, only to have Intel Corporate to come through and set a hiring freeze.  This is stupid.  It should be that if the team has been given permission, headcount, to hire, that they should be exempt from these hiring freezes, at least for 45 days or something.  However, it is not like that and the unintended side effect is that teams will hire substandard candidates just to fill some headcount.  Do that several times and the org is infected with wrong people.\r\n\r\nAnother problem with hiring is the equity and diversity push Intel is making.  I am all for hiring diversity but not at the cost of talent and productivity.  Make every effort to get the diverse candidates into the pool of applicants.  However, now Intel will hire some non-white tech female(for example) and tell an org you can have this person for free, won't tally against your headcount, if you can find some place to put her.  This is not how you build a strong capable team.  To do that, you need to find as many candidates as possible, interview them and take the strongest person regardless of race or sex.  I understand there is discrimination.  However, I think engineers are quite often interested in grabbing the person that helps their team and their cause the most.\r\n\r\nThe way Intel handled this last round of layoffs was dishonest, stupid and damaging.  At focal every year your manager can affect two items, your rating and your stock bonus.  Performance is supposed to be reflected in your rating, NOT your stocks.  However, this year (June 2015) Intel decided to use the stocks as another metric to trim some employees.  Intel made several acquisitions of companies and apparently didn't like carrying over 100,000 employees world wide.  So they used the stocks.  So people with a \"Successful\" rating with the lowest stocks, Stock Level 4, twice in the last 4 years were let go.  The problem with this is that it is unfair and managers gave SL4 to their employees for a variety of reasons.  For example, quality is an adjunct function at Intel and so managers often gave the better stocks to their direct employees rather than the quality contingent attached to their team.  What was the result, the quality teams at Intel had huge loses.  I guess it's all for the best.  Quality concerns at Intel were always an afterthought.\r\n\r\nIntel is a very conservative, Republican-like company.  That doesn't show up until Intel comes out AGAINST Net Neutrality.  In Portland, the company stance is particularly incongruous with the workers who work there, largely a liberal population.  To argue that internet connectivity is not as fundamental a utility as telephone was back in the day is being dishonest.  I understand that companies like Intel and IBM can draw straight lines from blocking Net Neutrality today to profitable sales for their companies, but we want leadership and principles from our company.  \r\n\r\nSadly, Intel is not a company with principles.  We have to take web-based training every year for ethics, etc.  Yet, Intel's upper management has landed us in court case after court case over the years for their unethical behavior.  Look it up if you;'re interested. \r\n\r\nFinally, a lot is said about work-life balance.  It is true that you can work a normal 9-5 type shift and survive at Intel.  However, I have never seen that behavior from those on the rise.  Everyone that has ever advanced at Intel has worked their butt off with 50 and 60 hour work weeks for years, including me.  That is the only way to get ahead, and everyone knows it, if doesn't admit it aloud."}, {"review_title": "Not Bad, But Not The Best", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "16 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Hillsboro, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pro #1) Intel works hard to take care of it's employees, and they far exceed other manufacturing companies, though they come up short when compared to the software industry. Perks are good (not great). Middle management seems to be encouraged to take care of their employees (they encourage you to use the parental leave program, encourage you to take vacations, are generous with sick time if you are really ill).\r\n\r\nPro #2) I never (really) feared for my job at Intel. As a Software Developer, I had plenty of opportunity to move around. In the event of a layoff (called 'Redeployment'), Intel typically works with you to find you another job within the company.\r\n\r\nPro #3) The cafeterias are great, not the best (and not free), but the fare exceeds the average lunch counter. \r\n\r\nPro #4) The insurance is generally excellent, Intel even offers up to $10k (lifetime) for fertility treatment. Though if you have a family you'll find the only reasonably priced plan is the High Deductible HealthCare plan (or Kaiser, I guess, if you don't mind Kaiser). They drastically increased the price of the traditional PPO for dependents in the past few years.It's not on par with Microsoft, but considering that the majority of the employees aren't in Software, this is far better than the competition offers.\r\n\r\nPro #5) Most of the offices have been redone, so it's no longer the drab grey cubicle-land that it once was.(The downside to this is they are moving towards an \"open office\" concept, which means there are few places to concentrate when you are writing code).\r\n\r\nPro #6 ) Intel now allows employees some choice when selecting a laptop. If your individual manager allows it, you can get an IT issued MacBook Pro. (My preferred dev os is OS X, so I struggled a bit with Windows when I first started and even bought my own Mac to work on before they made this an option).If you don't have strong feelings about the laptop you carry, you probably aren't using enough. :)\r\n\r\nPro #7) One thing I really liked about the culture was the data before feelings mantra. Most of Intel follows the philosophy that as long as you have the data to back up what you say, then it doesn't matter if you are an entry level tech or a Senior Fellow (highest engineering rank), you can drive your idea forward. It's not always practiced, but it was practiced more than I've seen at any other large company.", "cons": "Some background, if you are unfamiliar with Intel's inner workings: Intel is first and foremost a silicon manufacturing company. The core of the company is the TMG group, which controls all the factories (fabs), researches & implements new process technology (they are responsible for shrinking the chips year after year). The other major groups within Intel are the architecture groups (Server, Desktop, etc), which create the designs for the chips (which TMG manufactures), the Software Group (SSG), and IT. I'm leaving out a lot of other groups, such as Finance, HR, etc, because I have no direct feedback on them.\r\n\r\nThis background is important in understanding the dichotomy of reviews on Intel. The TMG side of Intel is a huge manufacturing company, which employs a ton of skilled technicians, engineers and material scientists. The average employee on the manufacturing side only has experience with manufacturing, and it's military like precision. The other companies that the tech's have worked for are generally other manufacturing companies. That isn't a disparagement of these people, they are the lifeblood of Intel, but Intel isn't competing with Google to hire them. Many of these folks thought the addition of 'Free Soda' to the perks was a bold step (this was done around 2008). Intel is constantly waging a war of providing just enough perks to keep the software people from bolting, without spending more than they have to. I'm not trying to make that sound negative, it is what it is; they're a for-profit company.\r\n\r\nCon #1) The perks aren't that great. If you want to make your friends jealous with the posh treatment, Intel is not the company for you. If there are other things you like about your Intel offer, then the perks are enough that you don't feel like you're working for a rust-belt manufacturing company.\r\n\r\n\r\nCon #2) The non-manufacturing groups are lacking focus and execution. I can't count the number of projects that I worked on that were cancelled mid-development. I worked in the \"new\" architecture groups for most of my time at Intel (the groups responsible for designing tablets, phones, wearables), and was constantly disappointed by the lack of focus in the management. Whereas Apple might create the iPod and then iterate through multiple generations to get the first shipping product, then iterate that product on the market until they have a runaway hit, Intel management seemed to prefer to toss a bunch of things at the wall to see what would stick. Worse, if they were throwing spaghetti at the wall, they wouldn't even bother to boil it first. They'd toss a package of dry noodles at the wall and then declare that it would never stick. Not so bad, if you don't spend 6 months packaging up the noodles prior to that. I've worked in plenty of places that would cancel a project before release (for many reasons), but at Intel it seemed like most projects ended that way. Look at Intel's history of failed mobile OS's (Moblin, Moblin2, Meego, Tizen). I sometimes felt as though Intel was secretly running a white collar welfare program, designed to keep software developers off the streets and out of trouble.\r\n \r\n\r\nCon #3) Intel's insides move very slowly. If you work within the system, you will die before you can accomplish anything. If you work outside of the system you risk being fired, but you'll at least have something to show for your efforts. Don't get me wrong, Intel has a lot of great people, but the system they have for rewarding employees (called 'Focal') is geared towards individual accomplishment more than moving the company as a whole forward. It seems obvious to measure an individual based on whether they completed their own key objectives, but in practice what I saw was a lot of \"not my job\" based behavior. I don't fault workers for this, but management needs to take a much better look at the goals they are setting to ensure that they are geared towards increasing productivity and delivering products that people want. My last year at Intel were spent trying to align my business unit with the company's stated best practices for software development. What made this difficult is that these services are hosted by Intel's IT group. Again, individually, I have a lot of respect for the folks I worked with in IT, but as a collective, it was impossible to do anything in less than a year. Application admins are reviewed based on their uptime, and not on the timeliness of new product offerings,etc; so if you have an existing dev process that requires a non-standard tweak to get it migrated, don't expect anyone to fall over themselves accommodating you. Worse, the IT Hosted Apps were ofter years behind the most release. Again, if you are a manufacturing company, that's great; no change means no chance of breaking. Software Development? That's not keeping up with the industry. \r\n\r\nCon #4) Egalitarianism is more a talking point that a real philosophy. If you aren't familiar with it, Intel prides itself on the fact that the execs don't have assigned parking or corner offices. Those things are true, but the execs typically have desks in corners with windows, and they have admins who will immediately stand up and approach you if you get near their desks. Also, each executive has a private conference room, so they don't have to talk where you can hear them. I get that there are real business reasons for this, but the executive privilege has been slowly eroding the egalitarianism in more mundane areas as well. The chance of you bending the ear of any random Fellow or VP, outside of a very controlled forum (such as the quarterly BUM) is pretty low. The culture/policies also draw a very thick line between the Blue Badges (regular Intel employees) and Green Badges (contractors). Again, there are good legal reasons why they don't treat contractors the same as employees, but the separation is much clearer at Intel than any other place I've worked.\r\n\r\nCon #5) Intel is increasing their use of lower wage contractors for everything. Typically these contractors are L1 Visa holders from India. Some of these folks are great, but there are a lot who seemed to be learning on the job. In senior roles, most of my experience was with middle management wanting you to delegate much of your work to these contractors. It turns your job as the \"engineer\" into being more of a project manager. If that's a direction you want to move in with your career, then Intel is for you.\r\n\r\nI could go on, but frankly this should be enough to help you know if Intel is for you or not.
