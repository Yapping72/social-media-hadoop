They also have a 100% matching program for charitable donations.\r\n\r\nAs a large company you won't be running out of licenses for industry-standard tools and the vendor support staff will return your emails and calls.\r\n\r\nAfter you've been in your position a year you can transfer internally and a few people do take advantage of this to get exposure to different areas of engineering or roles.", "cons": "As such a large company any person's experience is going to reflect the specific division and group they end up in. So I can only comment from what I saw. \r\n\r\nPay is a bit low compared to peers.  Younger engineers leaving after a few years at Intel get big raises but that's always been true in engineering; once you join just about any employer out of college you only get a few percent a year raises and its up to you to get a big jump by leaving after no more than 5 years at that first job (or at least get offers and see if your current employer will match, knowing you have to leave if they don't match) \r\n\r\nIntel uses a mix of industry standard tools and in-house ones. The staff is made up of people who have only been there a few years and lifers who joined out of college and have 20+ years at Intel. This has 3 consequences. First, using the in-house tools depends on tribal knowledge. To the extent documentation exists it will be filled with jargon such as project names and references to previous tools this one replaced.  If you don't know what these were (and as a new hire you won't) then much of  the documentation is useless. Second,  change is hard because the people making decisions are often those with long tenure. They justify things with \"we've always done it this way\" because they are comfortable with the convoluted steps needed to configure and run the in-house tools and flows. Third, some (if not most depending on job assignment) of skills younger engineers learn at Intel have little to no value to employers not named Intel. There are people with 5+ years experience that have the same value to any other employer as a college grad, so they face a challenge if they want to look elsewhere. \r\n\r\nIntel has literally thousands of engineering positions and a person taking ownership of their career can build a wonderful resume that would make them an attractive candidate elsewhere in case there is a layoff or they decide to leave. Relatively few people do this however. A key lesson to understand at any large company is the only person looking out for your interests is you. This is especially relevant if all you're doing is running in-house tools and flows.\r\n\r\nA surprising lesson is how much personal connections matter to getting your job done at Intel. Intel works on large chips and any person doing actual engineering work (as opposed to management) only is working on a small slice of the chip, usually just a few steps of the overall effort to design and integrate one of the many modules into the chip. You may be running timing, or verification, or placement, etc. So you'll need to work with other engineers to get the module in, especially when you have problems due to their work or vice-versa. My advice here is how critical it is to build a reputation of doing everything you can to help out when someone has a problem that may be from work you own. Eventually the tables will turn and you'll need help from others; they'll remember whether you helped them and their teammates or just tried to pass the buck when they needed you."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Service Delivery Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work for a. leading hardware company.", "cons": "Nothing specific to report out."}, {"review_title": "Manager often raised voice got mad when I left for another blue chip company", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer Working Student", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- The cafeteria is quite nice\r\n- There were free snacks and coffee", "cons": "- Manager interrupted the on-site interview process when his phone rang, which showed a lack of respect\r\n- There was no communication within the team, some team members didn't talk for years with each other (as I was told on my last day)\r\n- Offered me an extension of my contract after a few months of working there but when I said that I would leave for another company, they gave me a bad employer's reference.

I will leave the normal pay / health care / retirement out of this as that is a personal decision that is so different for a 25 year old than it is for a 40 year old or a 50 year old. What I say on that subject would be largely irrelevant to many. Suffice to say I have been here 20+ years so it is good for me. What really keeps me at Intel is the technology we invent on a day to day basis. I truly believe we are doing things that change the world. We are not always first and not always the best at everything. But we keep going and what we put out had the opportunity to changes lives around the world. I love that.

Sometime obvious changes are embarked upon slowly as it is hard to get 100K+ people to move in a new direction. The other issue I have, and this will not be a popular opinion probably, is that I feel that we have gone too far on diversity and inclusion. I am not against any diversity or inclusive activities. What I am against is having it thrown at me every day and tying my pay to it. There should not be bonus kickers that relate to diverse hiring - that is nothing I can control nor should it be there at all. I am still old school where you hire the best person for the job and then investigate why one manager seems to hire only 40 year old white male. Go after people that offend vs telling a manager a diverse candidate is the requirement when the non-diverse candidate is clearly the better choice. I have been on hiring panels where that was forced on me so no one can tell me it is not happening. I see Intel as having many of the same big company problems my friends and family have at their big companies.

They also have a 100% matching program for charitable donations.\r\n\r\nAs a large company you won't be running out of licenses for industry-standard tools and the vendor support staff will return your emails and calls.\r\n\r\nAfter you've been in your position a year you can transfer internally and a few people do take advantage of this to get exposure to different areas of engineering or roles.", "cons": "As such a large company any person's experience is going to reflect the specific division and group they end up in. So I can only comment from what I saw. \r\n\r\nPay is a bit low compared to peers.  Younger engineers leaving after a few years at Intel get big raises but that's always been true in engineering; once you join just about any employer out of college you only get a few percent a year raises and its up to you to get a big jump by leaving after no more than 5 years at that first job (or at least get offers and see if your current employer will match, knowing you have to leave if they don't match) \r\n\r\nIntel uses a mix of industry standard tools and in-house ones. The staff is made up of people who have only been there a few years and lifers who joined out of college and have 20+ years at Intel. This has 3 consequences. First, using the in-house tools depends on tribal knowledge. To the extent documentation exists it will be filled with jargon such as project names and references to previous tools this one replaced.  If you don't know what these were (and as a new hire you won't) then much of  the documentation is useless. Second,  change is hard because the people making decisions are often those with long tenure. They justify things with \"we've always done it this way\" because they are comfortable with the convoluted steps needed to configure and run the in-house tools and flows. Third, some (if not most depending on job assignment) of skills younger engineers learn at Intel have little to no value to employers not named Intel. There are people with 5+ years experience that have the same value to any other employer as a college grad, so they face a challenge if they want to look elsewhere. \r\n\r\nIntel has literally thousands of engineering positions and a person taking ownership of their career can build a wonderful resume that would make them an attractive candidate elsewhere in case there is a layoff or they decide to leave. Relatively few people do this however. A key lesson to understand at any large company is the only person looking out for your interests is you. This is especially relevant if all you're doing is running in-house tools and flows.\r\n\r\nA surprising lesson is how much personal connections matter to getting your job done at Intel. Intel works on large chips and any person doing actual engineering work (as opposed to management) only is working on a small slice of the chip, usually just a few steps of the overall effort to design and integrate one of the many modules into the chip. You may be running timing, or verification, or placement, etc. So you'll need to work with other engineers to get the module in, especially when you have problems due to their work or vice-versa. My advice here is how critical it is to build a reputation of doing everything you can to help out when someone has a problem that may be from work you own. Eventually the tables will turn and you'll need help from others; they'll remember whether you helped them and their teammates or just tried to pass the buck when they needed you."}, {"review_title": "Great company to work at.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Technical Account Manager in Raleigh, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Highest level of technology innovation.", "cons": "Several business units sometimes have differing opinions about how to go to market."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Service Delivery Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work for a. leading hardware company.", "cons": "Nothing specific to report out."}, {"review_title": "Manager often raised voice got mad when I left for another blue chip company", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer Working Student", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- The cafeteria is quite nice\r\n- There were free snacks and coffee", "cons": "- Manager interrupted the on-site interview process when his phone rang, which showed a lack of respect\r\n- There was no communication within the team, some team members didn't talk for years with each other (as I was told on my last day)\r\n- Offered me an extension of my contract after a few months of working there but when I said that I would leave for another company, they gave me a bad employer's reference.
