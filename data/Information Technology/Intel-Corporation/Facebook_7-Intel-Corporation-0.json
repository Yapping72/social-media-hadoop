Can make life stressful. - Over-management; lots of schemes and initiatives created by a bored middle-management, that take up lots of time with little return more often than not. - Death by meetings; often feels like I spend more time in meetings than it does doing work.

But if you are inquisitive, this job will be tough. Without the bachelors (if you don't have), they won't pay you much attention. You won't get training beyond what they want you to do and it will really confuse you when you interact with other departments.

Still at the forefront of processor design and innovation. Management seems to be moving in the right direction. Pat's weekly updates feel a lot more transparent than past CEOs. Lot of long-term development and investment plans that could really pay off - an exciting roadmap. If Pat is to be believed, we are at the bottom of a saddle period now, so we will be riding high again in not too long as R&D is completed and investments pay off.",

This causes a cumulation of lost $$ much higher than simple base salary comparison. 3. Don't go to HR if you have a problem with a toxic work environment. There is a way to search for/interview for other internal jobs without your boss knowing about it. Switch jobs asap if there is a problem. Because it is most probably not about you, and you can't fix a bad situation. 4. Strongly suggest you maximize base pay (due to cumulative impact) during job negotiations. New California laws also require them to be more transparent about pay so that inequities are more visible. Advocate for yourself without expecting fairness. 5.

They\u2019ve also eliminated all performance awards (even simple Kudus, which is as little as $10). And while Intel is not a high compensation company to begin with, executive leadership has also reduced base salaries: 5% for grade 7-10, increased to only a 25% reduction of the CEOs\u2019s base salary. Meanwhile, the CEO\u2019s earnings is essentially all stock, making this of no consequence to him or his senior leaders, even while the HR Exec claims senior leaders are taking their fair share of this burden (I\u2019m paraphrasing). They choose to keep their above average dividends in place making sure they\u2019re making plenty on the stock\u2019s minor improvements from this annihilation of the talent and remaining culture of the company. All of this putting the burden of this \u2018righting of the ship\u2019 on the lower staff rather than the leaders responsible for destroying this company\u2019s technological leadership through awful roadmap decisions and so many terrible acquisitions that all cash made in the hay day has been lost with absolutely nothing to show for it. This all while laying off so many people and shipping jobs to \u201clow cost geos\u201d. All this while happily taking federal incentives for massive capital investments. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves either, this layoff and compensation reduction was done because they know the tech industry is imploding making it near impossible for anyone to decide to leave; everyone is basically trapped. IMHO: The roadmap has potential to improve the outlook for this company in the next decade, but I find this senior leadership behavior horrible and a violation of the social contract they have with the employees and the communities that they benefit from. Finally, on top of all of this, even before the layoffs and compensation cuts, I have talked to so many peers who\u2019ve literally said that the culture is gotten so awful and the workload has become so overwhelming that it\u2019s \u2018slowly killing us\u2019."

It's disheartening to continually work on projects, get a round of applause from HR, then see it get languish with the actual customers.\nSkills of employees is not balanced - due to lack of ability, I was consistently working on \"high priority\" projects because I was the only one who was able to. Of course, these projects weren't even needed so I burnt out for nothing.\nPay is not competitive when looking externally. \n\"Critical\" initiatives are supported by a single person with 0 budget. Lots of lip service to these RISE goals but no actual internal investment.\nProfessional knowledge is not respected if you're lower in hierarchy."

I interviewed at other sites for positions where I could grow in the company but the transfer block deterred hiring managers from extending an offer and when I did get one I was told 'no'. The  senior managers dont relate and dont care because their queue for their next promotion is years-long and they are already committed to OTF/Arizona at this point in their career so they dont understand how damaging this is to early/mid career people. Accepting a position at this site at Intel was the biggest career mistake I have ever made, while my peers at other companies have been able to grow in their company unrestricted. I and many of my peers consider it unethical, and just plain wrong. Additionally, due to the transfer block people just straight up leave the company (bitter and with no intent of ever coming back) rather than moving to a team or site or position that best suits their skillset. It flies in the face of what broader Intel claims to stand for but seems to go unchallenged."

When voiced out they usually talk their way out of it. \r\n\r\nEvery small thing that happens would turn into an escalation with the JLL management. \r\n\r\nThey would check CCTV on what you are doing , if you are late abit or they feel you are lying. Really uncalled for.

This causes a cumulation of lost $$ much higher than simple base salary comparison. 3. Don't go to HR if you have a problem with a toxic work environment. There is a way to search for/interview for other internal jobs without your boss knowing about it. Switch jobs asap if there is a problem. Because it is most probably not about you, and you can't fix a bad situation. 4. Strongly suggest you maximize base pay (due to cumulative impact) during job negotiations. New California laws also require them to be more transparent about pay so that inequities are more visible. Advocate for yourself without expecting fairness. 5.

It will take a few months to prove your worth and get the management to trust you with significant tasks, but once that's done you will be treated as an equal team member. This allows you to learn a whole lot more than in similar jobs in other companies that only give \"dirty work\" to students.

The fact that you are able to work from home offers much-needed flexibility that allows you to balance work and studies.",

They\u2019ve also eliminated all performance awards (even simple Kudus, which is as little as $10). And while Intel is not a high compensation company to begin with, executive leadership has also reduced base salaries: 5% for grade 7-10, increased to only a 25% reduction of the CEOs\u2019s base salary. Meanwhile, the CEO\u2019s earnings is essentially all stock, making this of no consequence to him or his senior leaders, even while the HR Exec claims senior leaders are taking their fair share of this burden (I\u2019m paraphrasing). They choose to keep their above average dividends in place making sure they\u2019re making plenty on the stock\u2019s minor improvements from this annihilation of the talent and remaining culture of the company. All of this putting the burden of this \u2018righting of the ship\u2019 on the lower staff rather than the leaders responsible for destroying this company\u2019s technological leadership through awful roadmap decisions and so many terrible acquisitions that all cash made in the hay day has been lost with absolutely nothing to show for it. This all while laying off so many people and shipping jobs to \u201clow cost geos\u201d. All this while happily taking federal incentives for massive capital investments. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves either, this layoff and compensation reduction was done because they know the tech industry is imploding making it near impossible for anyone to decide to leave; everyone is basically trapped. IMHO: The roadmap has potential to improve the outlook for this company in the next decade, but I find this senior leadership behavior horrible and a violation of the social contract they have with the employees and the communities that they benefit from. Finally, on top of all of this, even before the layoffs and compensation cuts, I have talked to so many peers who\u2019ve literally said that the culture is gotten so awful and the workload has become so overwhelming that it\u2019s \u2018slowly killing us\u2019."

Excellent job mobility and flexibility for work and personal circumstances and a real team-oriented 'all in this together' attitude. Plus, there is an indescribable thrill to be working on the bleeding edge of the science, the technology, the process, etc. Intel remains a world-class technology innovator.\r\n\r\nThe majority, a smaller majority than before (pre 2010 ish), of people there are very very skilled, capable and productive. They are easily able to overcome the statistically necessary under-performers while they have a bad year, or two. It all works out as the teams naturally form a mix of skills and attitudes which complement each other. Over the long-term these mixes are more productive than homogeneous groups of excelling performers.\r\n\r\nFamously, the sabbatical benefit is to die for. 8 weeks paid sabbatical, no strings, every 7 years, or 4 weeks every 4 years. Intelites count in 7-year increments. Plan it well, make use of it. DO NOT fritter it away on home improvements.",

The Focal system encourages poor antisocial behaviors as employees compete for finite compensation crumbs which are distributed by a multi-tier rating and ranking system. All the objective behaviors of 10 months are tossed aside for subjective visibility-promoting activities in the critical 2 months with a healthy dose of lies and self-promotion. You are at the mercy of short term whims and transitory fads where the appearance of productivity outweighs the achievement of the whole 12 months. It is brutal. Sometimes you win; sometimes you lose. But nowadays losing carries a terminal prognosis.\r\n\r\nAll the above is flavored by a new positive discrimination towards underrepresented minorities (URMs) which by executive decree have preference for promotion, transfers, and in some measure the ranking benefits. Non-URMs have an additional hurdle of proving their unique ability to fit a role; URMs can fit anywhere and do not cost a department headcount budget for a period of time. Net-net is that if you are not a URM then hiring, transfer, and benefit opportunities narrow quickly. Already there are pockets of URMs which almost exclusively hire each other and even speak their own language in meetings to exclude employees not of that background."

Of course, these projects weren't even needed so I burnt out for nothing.\nPay is not competitive when looking externally. \n\"Critical\" initiatives are supported by a single person with 0 budget.

I interviewed at other sites for positions where I could grow in the company but the transfer block deterred hiring managers from extending an offer and when I did get one I was told 'no'. The  senior managers dont relate and dont care because their queue for their next promotion is years-long and they are already committed to OTF/Arizona at this point in their career so they dont understand how damaging this is to early/mid career people. Accepting a position at this site at Intel was the biggest career mistake I have ever made, while my peers at other companies have been able to grow in their company unrestricted. I and many of my peers consider it unethical, and just plain wrong. Additionally, due to the transfer block people just straight up leave the company (bitter and with no intent of ever coming back) rather than moving to a team or site or position that best suits their skillset. It flies in the face of what broader Intel claims to stand for but seems to go unchallenged."
