		"pros": "Temporarily a stable job.\n\nWill provide work visa if you need one.\n\nYou can get a job if you are completely fresh out of college. In fact this is precisely what Intel prefers. Intel does not like to hire experienced people, and instead prefers to hire inexperienced college grads and pay them the lowest salary the market would allow. This gives Intel the advantage of having young, single, hardworking engineers at very low salaries.\n\nSurprisingly intelligent peers. One of the unfortunate things is that smart engineers graduating from top schools in the country think that Intel is a great company. Intel has a great legacy to talk about. It has a rich legacy and a great history of amazing products and innovation. But that era is long past. Intel is now a middle-aged (it is almost exactly 50 years old now) obese company with a totally crazy CEO. The era of Intel's greatness is over now. Unfortunately, students graduating from universities don't know this. They learn about what amazing things Intel did almost 15 years ago and are awe-struck, and they want to join!\n\nPractically the only major company with a large fab. So if you want a job in the fab, this is one of the companies you could consider. But as such jobs in the fabs are on a slow decline. Remember, automation is key in everything. And Intel's 10nm, 7nm, and 5nm are not really as far ahead of the competition as they claim. In fact the thing Intel senior staff has repeatedly ignored is that time to silicon is as important - if not more - as silicon manufacturing readiness.",
		"cons": "Intel is a slowly dying company. And jobs there are about as stable as the temperature of water in a kettle that is on a low flame. So when you join you will not know at all that the company is dying, but it is slowly dying.\n\nPoor salaries. Actually the \"highly paid\" Principal Engineers are abysmally paid according to industry standards. Intel HR compares salaries with other companies of \"similar nature\", but Intel has to grow up and learn that employees do not use that criterion when deciding whether to stay.\n\nIntel does NOT reward additional industry experience or knowledge with appropriate salary difference against fresh graduates. As a result, your salary will NOT be ANY higher than a fresh graduate with zero industry experience, even if you have prior experience in industry.\n\nStagnant salaries. In fact this is the #1 indicator of a slowly dying company. The smartest of their engineers could get a salary increment of less than $2000 additional, year on year. Their best performing engineers do not get the best salary increments. If you want a good salary increment you better hope that you are some sort of a manager. Intel rewards ONLY, and ONLY managers. In fact, the only individual contributors that might be rewarded are Program Managers.\n\nPractically the only main job growth avenue is to become some sort of a Program Manager or become the supervisor for your team. Yes, Intel does have a technical track for growth. And yes, there are divisions where tech ladder is a serious job growth avenue. But the VAST MAJORITY of Intel jobs can advance to the next level as ONLY a sort of Program Manager (or someone \"driving\" something tracking its schedule) or at best as the supervisor in your team - a minor promotion. But remember you became a manager ONLY because your boss became a second-level manager. And now there may be additional levels between you and the chain of command. In my view, job growth should be measured in terms of your sphere of influence - how wide is the circle of people you influence. What you'll realize is that while you may technically influence a very large number of people, you will probably never get rewarded for that. And even if your managerial sphere of influence is moderately improved, remember that Intel is an ocean of very smart people, all wanting to grow just like you.\n\nBe ready to be unsatisfied with the salary for years. Your manager will keep showing you a carrot of phenomenal job growth out in the future \"if you do this one thing\". But that doesn't really matter. They've decided to pay you what they plan to. This carrot is only a fake. When it comes time to actually give the increment you deserve \"low budget\", \"lack of funds\" etc., are commonly heard. Intel has the most unscrupulous and the most unfair and dishonest managers of all in the entire industry.\n\nPlease be forewarned."

Not that they are technologically incompetent, but becasue the important technological decisions/directions are changed on a weekly basis due to product roadmap change. I feel this company is very product/market oriented. Because of this, an engineer's work for weeks, months or even years, easily goes in vain simply due to the direction change. In the end of the year, no one cares what you have done, the managers only value the outcome and if you have none, regardless it's due to the directions change, you are screwed. It just makes you feel you are cheap and expendable.\r\n\r\nAn engineer in PTD has minimum chance of career growth. No way to switch to other companies because of the geological location. The skills are also not very transferrable considering all the code names and acronyms. Everything is secret. You can only learn what you need to know. \r\n\r\nWeekend meetings and extra work often ruin your personal life and trip plans. Depending on the manager, you can be called for weekend coverage very often with no compensation day. Favoritism is something that does exist. The exposure to top managers decides how good your Focal is, not the time/effort you spent on your work. So practice your bragging/chit-chat skill if you decide to climb the Intel ladder. Also be sure to spend time on attending every possible meeting than doing the job. Someone will pick it up anyway. Top managers are impressed by talkers much more than doers."

IT is in shambles so productivity has hit an all time low with outsourcing abound. We're behind in process technology after being the leader of the pack for so many years, and the gap is growing. We also can't seem to find an industry where we can land a hit on so we acquire hoping to gain market share and then when we fail we sell off at a loss. Culture health within Intel has also hit an all time low.

They're essentially YES men/women pleasing those above them.

People who worked in Intel for more years lack skills and are incompetent/useless outside India.People who join Intel after college are either stuck in Intel forever or are forced to go for higher studies.

There are some very senior people in the team who are so insecure that they will try everything they can to make sure that the junior people will not learn anything so that they can remain important.

They will also use these indicators to make gross and inaccurate judgments against teams and individuals. Worst of all, they don't have a problem with sweeping indicators that aren't to their liking under the rug against your better judgment. A few months later, when what they swept under the rug becomes an urgent problem, they are very quick to blame you for not alerting them about it even though you did. At this point, they demand you come in on the weekend to resolve a situation which could have easily been avoided had they listened in the first place. All of this happens with no acknowledgement that this is mostly their failure, and with no appreciation of the fact that you are giving up personal time to bail them out.        \r\n\r\nThere is a matrix management structure which means that you will report to additional managers aside from your own manager. Often, the things these managers want you to do for them are in direct conflict with each other, or will take a large amount of time to complete. This puts you in a position where it is hard to give all the managers you report to what they want. Thus, when you don't deliver on some of these tasks, you will have multiple managers thrashing you and propagating a negative perception about you across the organization. Unless you are wiling to work 60-80 hour weeks regularly you will have very slim chances at pleasing them all. \r\n\r\nWhat fuels a lot of the above is that most of the managers are people managers and not tech managers or tech leads. This is the one thing that some of these managers actually recognize, but just like with everything else, they do nothing about it. The major drawback of having managers that don't want to or have never done the work themselves, is that they have no concept of what they are asking you to do, so it makes them quicker to jump to thrashing you about certain tasks if they \"take too long\" for you to complete. \r\n\r\nIf you bring up any of these issues to your management, they will usually give you the \"yes I understand\" nod, but eventually respond with something similar to \"it's all on you to fix this\". The managers never bother to ask themselves if there is something they can do to correct some of the structural issues that are present within the culture of the organization. This is the root cause of all the issues in silicon validation in Austin. \r\n\r\nOverall, it's a toxic place to work. There is cultural change that needs to happen, and it needs to come from middle and upper management since they make the decisions that foster this despicable culture. The good news is, it seems like these problems aren't the case at other Intel sites or even in other groups outside of validation in Austin. It seems like Intel really can be a great place to work if you land in the right team."

The only way to get to a raise is to be a people pleaser and work 80 hours or leave)\n\nThere are some really knowledgeable programmers  who know all the tricks to squeeze every ounce of performance out of a CPU.",
		"cons": "Data science / machine learning specific comments:\nIntel has little vision for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It does not align with market expectations. It also does not want to solve current pain points of big data which sorely needs easy parallelization solutions and easy engineering tools. Most of the managers and executives are old: they don\u2019t want to innovate either from a hardware nor a software standpoint, but to reuse old business models that \u201cworked\u201d. They keep using deep learning benchmarks for computer vision that show their inferior performance to GPUs when there are NLP benchmarks that CPUs are better at than GPUs. And they just don\u2019t even bother to hire people who know how to write machine learning benchmarks that showcase their products in a better light. \n\nThey have trouble attracting good machine learning talents and the imposters scare the real talents away. \nI see \u201cdata scientists\u201d and \u201cmachine learning researchers\u201d at Intel who are actually programmers who took a few Coursera courses with a random (CS) degree. They think by running a few online tutorials, they KNOW machine learning and data science. \n\nSoftware at Intel is considered as non essential as hardware is the bread and butter. It speaks a lot for the (lower perceived) status of the software developers or data scientists at Intel. More importantly, if you are a software developer, expect that boosting hardware benchmarks to be your sole mission. \n\nCulture wise:\nThe Data Center Group, despite being the growth engine, is beaten up by NVIDIA and has low moral. There are constant reorganizations, hiring freezes and firing rounds because the executives need to act like they are doing things. It cannot attract talent as it pays peanuts compared to top tier tech companies and act arrogantly like it is a top tier software tech company.\nI saw teams and teams of developers of promising software products (eg Apache spark and Hadoop) got gutted just when they start to get results.\n\nAlso a lot of the devs do not know nor use modern software engineering practices like version control nor software testing for work. If you use something more up to date you will get marginalized. (Forget about teamwork).\n\nThere is also little to no accountability for projects. They don\u2019t care if a job is done well they only want you to say you have worked on certain shiny technology.\n\n\nHR experience: \nThey have terrible hiring procedure and HR people have terrible attitude. The HR pits teams against one another to fight for talent and they complain to each other afterwards. The HR person also had the worst attitude for salary negotiation as if s/he does not expect a negotiation. \n\nThe clerical staff was overworked by all the managers for supplies and paperwork and was discontinued because s/he was on a contract and it expired."

If Intel had a 2 year lead, why would they need to lay off 10% of their work force in Rio Rancho? If they had a 2 year lead, why are their chip sales 5% lower in 2013 compared to 2012? The reality is that Samsung and TSMC are dominating Intel in the cell phone and tablet markets. Intel has focused too much on laptops and PCs, and they have ignored cell phones and tablets. Now, Intel is 10 years behind in cell phones and tablets, and they refuse to consider new ideas, such as licensing their designs to third parties or making chips that aren't based on x86 architecture.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering working at Intel, pay attention to what is happening right now. Intel does not have a realistic 10 year plan. I would not be surprised if Intel lays off more people within 10 years. Intel is shrinking, not growing. Intel is simply not adapting to changes fast enough, and upper management refuses to consider making changes to Intel's business philosophy."

Everyone blames other people and teams for problems and no one ever says, \"I own this problem.  I will solve it.\" which leads to nothing getting done.  For example in the whole time I was there they never fixed the issue of getting Macs onto their network.   You can \"connect\" but then you can't get to critical resources like...the Internet.  Or if you can get to the Internet then you can't connect to company web pages that are optimized for IE 7.  That's not a joke either.  It's not a complaint because as an Intel employee you get used to things being slow and not working right.  I just offer it as a tangible example.\r\n\r\nIf you have ANY talent at all stay away from this company.  If you are marginal in talent then jump right in. By the way enjoy the on-boarding process.

As the years have gone by, the leadership of the CEOs (and, inevitably, the management chain under them) has steadily degraded to what seems like rock bottom with the current CEO, Brian Krzanich.  BK, as he is affectionately (?) known, is in way over his head, and seems to be running the company more as a social justice platform than as a business.   Failed decision follows failed decision, each accompanied by multi-billion dollar losses.  But what does this mean to the average employee?  Nothing good:  intent on making up for lost profits through cost cutting, the company has decided that loyalty to employees is a thing of the past.  They are working to transfer all jobs to the lowest bidder by replacing US jobs with overseas jobs, and experienced workers with new hires.  To accomplish this, they are laying off (or encouraging the defection of) tens of thousands of their best and most experienced people.  This is cratering employee morale, and leaving behind more work for less people.  Trust me, you don't want to be one of those 'left behind', nor do you want to begin your career with a company that will start you off you in such an environment. \r\nWorkplace accommodations have been dropping for years - employees are expected to empty their own trash, accept smaller cubicles every year, and overcrowded buildings make it tough to even find a conference room.  \r\nBenefits have been dropping for years - at one time Intel hired the best and brightest, and strived for first-in-class pay and benefits.  Now they look for employees who are merely 'qualified', and continuously decrease benefits (such as retirement benefits), shooting for compensation that 'is in line with peer averages'.\r\nIf you're a low to mediocre performer, Intel may be the place for you.  For the best and brightest, you would be better off looking elsewhere."

Very friendly to work with or extremely negative. One co-worker actually had a disclaimer on his email signature which read (paraphrase), \"I apologize for being extremely difficult and negative to work with. It is because of my long term employment with Intel\". News Flash: If you aren't trying to fix it then it isn't an apology.\r\nThe work environment was so stressful for me that I finally began barfing 2 - 4 times a week.\r\nThe Test Fixtures with which I worked were constantly being altered by other people with no notes indicating what had been done. Thus, almost every day I had to get the lab manager to help me troubleshoot the darn things. This inevitably led to \"Ivan the Terrible\" browbeating me for taking too much time.\r\nThere was NO \"How To\" documentation regarding procedures and processes. It was ALL tribal knowledge and you really had to know what question to ask in order to \"fill in the blanks\".\r\nContractors are only allowed to work when \"real\" employees are present. Hence, contractors, me specifically, had no avenue to make up hours. This REALLY hurt over the Christmas and New Year weekend where I lost a total of 32 hours of pay.\r\nMy work hours were mandated as 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Nine hours because I was required to take a one hour lunch break.\r\nContractors, at least for me, were made to feel unwelcome and NEVER a part of the team. I was pretty much treated like n inconvenient piece of meat.\r\nI had, at one time, vowed to never work at Intel due to their penchant for laying of a few thousand employees and then replacing them with Contractors. For me that is dishonest and unethical. I took this contract against my better judgement because I was unemployed and dying of \"Cabin Fever\".\r\nThis was by far the most damaging contract I have ever worked, both psychologically and physically."

The team builders often times fail because no one wants to see those they work with 12-hours per day after work.\r\nThere's a department called the Great Place to Work department that puts together lame things for folks to feel like they're important but they are simply ridiculous ways of saying \"we're trying\" rather than make real changes to end the divisive between co-workers.\r\nthere is no trust and it's rare to find someone who is truly trying because they so often get doors slammed in their face.\r\nThe large cafe I mentioned earlier is large indeed with lots of choices. The food typically is horrible and they completely over charge.\r\nLots of time off is followed by a horrible 12-hour, ball-busting shift....and they continue to cut resources so everyone remaining has to work even harder.\r\nQuite the sweat shop inside the fab.\r\nThe CEO said in a video he wants to begin hiring more folks from other cultures because he thinks white males have enjoyed too many years of privilege.\r\nMorale is worse than I've ever seen in my 30-year career in the semiconductor industry."

For example you must pay for each cup of coffee u consume (1.89$), you not allowed to drive bicycles, sick time off or any personal time off at all and referred to as \"green badge\".  From the very beginning  things were rather odd.  When I started , i was left alone for about a week. No introductions to team members, no lunch , nothing. Out of boredom i wrote a 20 proposal with visuals and backing stats how to improve the software i was assigned to. Well it was completely ignored , not even response to email acknowledging its existence. Indian manager kept polite , but very distant and dint wanna hear nothing about innovations or at least upgrading .net 4.0 to something more fresh. Oh well, ok fine.  They dont use  async , solid or design patterns. The code is working , well kinda -  if you careful about clicks u good. They dont engage in technical discussions, code reviews or any kind active knowledge sharing. Tools such as Resharper ,  only out of you own pocket. Also had to bring my personal headphones and mic for conf calls. The work hours, and lunch time very strict and always had to start and finish day at the minutes precision. I was getting tired of paying for coffee and asked if i could bring my own coffee make. Nope. Long story short the place felt like prison. I cant say if all teams are like that, but mine was.

Some of the employees will continue to perpetuate the hype and lies because they are a part of the ingrained negative politics and backward thinking culture.\r\n3) Their focal process is unfair, based on politics, favoritism and CYA tactics.\r\n4) The open door investigation process and warm line is a joke.  It served to only collect information from the employee, appease them temporarily, just to discredit them and kick them out of Intel, so that they will not have to deal with them anymore.  This was the most sneaky and underhanded tactic that I have ever experienced in my professional career.   It would take an act of God for me to ever trust Intel again.\r\n5) Retention of women in STEM is also laughable.  Support is limited to those that have a dedicated mentor.  Those that do not have one are vulnerable to the politics and  the recent popular backlash against women and minorities within Intel.  \r\n6) New people are thrown into a disorganized group with ill-defined processes, managers with no management skills, direction and EQ. They are then expected to succeed when key team members are laid off in the middle of a project and without the necessary support from some team members and managers."

		"duration": "N/A",
		"pros": "Temporarily a stable job.\n\nWill provide work visa if you need one.\n\nYou can get a job if you are completely fresh out of college. In fact this is precisely what Intel prefers. Intel does not like to hire experienced people, and instead prefers to hire inexperienced college grads and pay them the lowest salary the market would allow. This gives Intel the advantage of having young, single, hardworking engineers at very low salaries.\n\nSurprisingly intelligent peers. One of the unfortunate things is that smart engineers graduating from top schools in the country think that Intel is a great company. Intel has a great legacy to talk about. It has a rich legacy and a great history of amazing products and innovation. But that era is long past. Intel is now a middle-aged (it is almost exactly 50 years old now) obese company with a totally crazy CEO. The era of Intel's greatness is over now. Unfortunately, students graduating from universities don't know this. They learn about what amazing things Intel did almost 15 years ago and are awe-struck, and they want to join!\n\nPractically the only major company with a large fab. So if you want a job in the fab, this is one of the companies you could consider. But as such jobs in the fabs are on a slow decline. Remember, automation is key in everything. And Intel's 10nm, 7nm, and 5nm are not really as far ahead of the competition as they claim. In fact the thing Intel senior staff has repeatedly ignored is that time to silicon is as important - if not more - as silicon manufacturing readiness.",
		"cons": "Intel is a slowly dying company. And jobs there are about as stable as the temperature of water in a kettle that is on a low flame. So when you join you will not know at all that the company is dying, but it is slowly dying.\n\nPoor salaries. Actually the \"highly paid\" Principal Engineers are abysmally paid according to industry standards. Intel HR compares salaries with other companies of \"similar nature\", but Intel has to grow up and learn that employees do not use that criterion when deciding whether to stay.\n\nIntel does NOT reward additional industry experience or knowledge with appropriate salary difference against fresh graduates. As a result, your salary will NOT be ANY higher than a fresh graduate with zero industry experience, even if you have prior experience in industry.\n\nStagnant salaries. In fact this is the #1 indicator of a slowly dying company. The smartest of their engineers could get a salary increment of less than $2000 additional, year on year. Their best performing engineers do not get the best salary increments. If you want a good salary increment you better hope that you are some sort of a manager. Intel rewards ONLY, and ONLY managers. In fact, the only individual contributors that might be rewarded are Program Managers.\n\nPractically the only main job growth avenue is to become some sort of a Program Manager or become the supervisor for your team. Yes, Intel does have a technical track for growth. And yes, there are divisions where tech ladder is a serious job growth avenue. But the VAST MAJORITY of Intel jobs can advance to the next level as ONLY a sort of Program Manager (or someone \"driving\" something tracking its schedule) or at best as the supervisor in your team - a minor promotion. But remember you became a manager ONLY because your boss became a second-level manager. And now there may be additional levels between you and the chain of command. In my view, job growth should be measured in terms of your sphere of influence - how wide is the circle of people you influence. What you'll realize is that while you may technically influence a very large number of people, you will probably never get rewarded for that. And even if your managerial sphere of influence is moderately improved, remember that Intel is an ocean of very smart people, all wanting to grow just like you.\n\nBe ready to be unsatisfied with the salary for years. Your manager will keep showing you a carrot of phenomenal job growth out in the future \"if you do this one thing\". But that doesn't really matter. They've decided to pay you what they plan to. This carrot is only a fake. When it comes time to actually give the increment you deserve \"low budget\", \"lack of funds\" etc., are commonly heard. Intel has the most unscrupulous and the most unfair and dishonest managers of all in the entire industry.\n\nPlease be forewarned."

Software engineers in my department are mostly under lots of stress getting a half baked product out quickly and then struggle with tons of bugs. And while we are fixing bugs and providing support to the users, the management pushed us to deliver more features or new app/tool. This department is super under resource and sadly the management still want to be even more stingy by expanding the business scope without hiring more engineers.\r\n\r\nI worked in the so called \"low cost geography\", and yet my wages and salary is not even on par with the market value after working in Intel for 3 years. This is a very slow career growth for me. And Intel is not as high tech as everyone think. They give engineers slow laptop, they still using old system and the management are pretty much old school and reluctant to change.\r\n\r\nThere is this graduate trainee program going on in Malaysia Site. Basically this program is to hire fresh grad with 1 year contract.  Unlike the permanent employee, all the graduate trainee are not entitled for various bonuses such as Quarterly Profit Bonus, Annual Performance Bonus. In my department the management treat the Graduate Trainee even worst. There are times where the department give priority for the permanent staff to have a proper wide screen monitor, while the Graduate Trainee only get to use a square IBM monitor! Graduate trainee also gets older laptop and they are not entitled to claim for broadband and online external training."

Not that they are technologically incompetent, but becasue the important technological decisions/directions are changed on a weekly basis due to product roadmap change. I feel this company is very product/market oriented. Because of this, an engineer's work for weeks, months or even years, easily goes in vain simply due to the direction change. In the end of the year, no one cares what you have done, the managers only value the outcome and if you have none, regardless it's due to the directions change, you are screwed. It just makes you feel you are cheap and expendable.\r\n\r\nAn engineer in PTD has minimum chance of career growth. No way to switch to other companies because of the geological location. The skills are also not very transferrable considering all the code names and acronyms. Everything is secret. You can only learn what you need to know. \r\n\r\nWeekend meetings and extra work often ruin your personal life and trip plans. Depending on the manager, you can be called for weekend coverage very often with no compensation day. Favoritism is something that does exist. The exposure to top managers decides how good your Focal is, not the time/effort you spent on your work. So practice your bragging/chit-chat skill if you decide to climb the Intel ladder. Also be sure to spend time on attending every possible meeting than doing the job. Someone will pick it up anyway. Top managers are impressed by talkers much more than doers."

IT is in shambles so productivity has hit an all time low with outsourcing abound. We're behind in process technology after being the leader of the pack for so many years, and the gap is growing. We also can't seem to find an industry where we can land a hit on so we acquire hoping to gain market share and then when we fail we sell off at a loss.

People who worked in Intel for more years lack skills and are incompetent/useless outside India.People who join Intel after college are either stuck in Intel forever or are forced to go for higher studies.

There are some very senior people in the team who are so insecure that they will try everything they can to make sure that the junior people will not learn anything so that they can remain important.

However, Intel made the policy enforcement retroactive to your previous year's job performance, meaning you didn't have a chance to correct anything that you may have just found out you were deficient in). \r\n\r\nMake an \"all decisions final\" edict, meaning no appeal if you're let go for any reason (the benefit of being an \"At Will\" employer). \r\n\r\nAnd, coincidentally, manage to primarily lay off (or encourage retirement among) employees with 15+ years of experience at Intel, or who are 50+ years old.

If you look at any long term employee who has made at least to middle-management, you can bet they are dishonest and shady. The company, in my opinion, inadvertantly rewards those who lie and hide the truth. There is no straight-talk between senior leadership and the rest. There is no straight talk between the middle-managers to the rest. There is only BS and it is pervasive. Everyone knows this. \r\n\r\nThe performance review is almost always a complete farce.

Today, Intel has virtually nothing to show for those tens of billions invested outside of its single core product. Why? Its culture is rotten, dishonest, racist, and degenerate and doesn't reward\\punish its employees properly. \r\n\r\nIntel has been a subject of numerous lawsuits that validates everything I stated above.

The only way to get to a raise is to be a people pleaser and work 80 hours or leave)\n\nThere are some really knowledgeable programmers  who know all the tricks to squeeze every ounce of performance out of a CPU.",
		"cons": "Data science / machine learning specific comments:\nIntel has little vision for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It does not align with market expectations. It also does not want to solve current pain points of big data which sorely needs easy parallelization solutions and easy engineering tools. Most of the managers and executives are old: they don\u2019t want to innovate either from a hardware nor a software standpoint, but to reuse old business models that \u201cworked\u201d. They keep using deep learning benchmarks for computer vision that show their inferior performance to GPUs when there are NLP benchmarks that CPUs are better at than GPUs. And they just don\u2019t even bother to hire people who know how to write machine learning benchmarks that showcase their products in a better light. \n\nThey have trouble attracting good machine learning talents and the imposters scare the real talents away. \nI see \u201cdata scientists\u201d and \u201cmachine learning researchers\u201d at Intel who are actually programmers who took a few Coursera courses with a random (CS) degree. They think by running a few online tutorials, they KNOW machine learning and data science. \n\nSoftware at Intel is considered as non essential as hardware is the bread and butter. It speaks a lot for the (lower perceived) status of the software developers or data scientists at Intel. More importantly, if you are a software developer, expect that boosting hardware benchmarks to be your sole mission. \n\nCulture wise:\nThe Data Center Group, despite being the growth engine, is beaten up by NVIDIA and has low moral. There are constant reorganizations, hiring freezes and firing rounds because the executives need to act like they are doing things. It cannot attract talent as it pays peanuts compared to top tier tech companies and act arrogantly like it is a top tier software tech company.\nI saw teams and teams of developers of promising software products (eg Apache spark and Hadoop) got gutted just when they start to get results.\n\nAlso a lot of the devs do not know nor use modern software engineering practices like version control nor software testing for work. If you use something more up to date you will get marginalized. (Forget about teamwork).\n\nThere is also little to no accountability for projects. They don\u2019t care if a job is done well they only want you to say you have worked on certain shiny technology.\n\n\nHR experience: \nThey have terrible hiring procedure and HR people have terrible attitude. The HR pits teams against one another to fight for talent and they complain to each other afterwards. The HR person also had the worst attitude for salary negotiation as if s/he does not expect a negotiation. \n\nThe clerical staff was overworked by all the managers for supplies and paperwork and was discontinued because s/he was on a contract and it expired."

Intel also has a habit of taking H1-B visa students who recently graduated and overworking them as much as possible. If you are a new graduate, do not come to Intel. There are much better companies.\r\n\r\nAs a process engineer, work/life balance is non-existent. Process Engineers are on-call 24 hours per day, and it is very common to receive phone calls at 3 am. Intel refuses to hire shift engineers. The Rio Rancho plant is also being downsized, and 10% of the work force will be laid off in the fall of 2013. \r\n\r\nIntel claims that it has a 2 year lead on its competitors, but that's a lie. If Intel had a 2 year lead, why would they need to lay off 10% of their work force in Rio Rancho? If they had a 2 year lead, why are their chip sales 5% lower in 2013 compared to 2012? The reality is that Samsung and TSMC are dominating Intel in the cell phone and tablet markets. Intel has focused too much on laptops and PCs, and they have ignored cell phones and tablets. Now, Intel is 10 years behind in cell phones and tablets, and they refuse to consider new ideas, such as licensing their designs to third parties or making chips that aren't based on x86 architecture.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering working at Intel, pay attention to what is happening right now. Intel does not have a realistic 10 year plan. I would not be surprised if Intel lays off more people within 10 years. Intel is shrinking, not growing. Intel is simply not adapting to changes fast enough, and upper management refuses to consider making changes to Intel's business philosophy."

Everyone blames other people and teams for problems and no one ever says, \"I own this problem.  I will solve it.\" which leads to nothing getting done.  For example in the whole time I was there they never fixed the issue of getting Macs onto their network.   You can \"connect\" but then you can't get to critical resources like...the Internet.  Or if you can get to the Internet then you can't connect to company web pages that are optimized for IE 7.  That's not a joke either.  It's not a complaint because as an Intel employee you get used to things being slow and not working right.  I just offer it as a tangible example.\r\n\r\nIf you have ANY talent at all stay away from this company.  If you are marginal in talent then jump right in. By the way enjoy the on-boarding process.

As the years have gone by, the leadership of the CEOs (and, inevitably, the management chain under them) has steadily degraded to what seems like rock bottom with the current CEO, Brian Krzanich.  BK, as he is affectionately (?) known, is in way over his head, and seems to be running the company more as a social justice platform than as a business.   Failed decision follows failed decision, each accompanied by multi-billion dollar losses.  But what does this mean to the average employee?  Nothing good:  intent on making up for lost profits through cost cutting, the company has decided that loyalty to employees is a thing of the past.  They are working to transfer all jobs to the lowest bidder by replacing US jobs with overseas jobs, and experienced workers with new hires.  To accomplish this, they are laying off (or encouraging the defection of) tens of thousands of their best and most experienced people.  This is cratering employee morale, and leaving behind more work for less people.  Trust me, you don't want to be one of those 'left behind', nor do you want to begin your career with a company that will start you off you in such an environment. \r\nWorkplace accommodations have been dropping for years - employees are expected to empty their own trash, accept smaller cubicles every year, and overcrowded buildings make it tough to even find a conference room.  \r\nBenefits have been dropping for years - at one time Intel hired the best and brightest, and strived for first-in-class pay and benefits.  Now they look for employees who are merely 'qualified', and continuously decrease benefits (such as retirement benefits), shooting for compensation that 'is in line with peer averages'.\r\nIf you're a low to mediocre performer, Intel may be the place for you.  For the best and brightest, you would be better off looking elsewhere."

For example you must pay for each cup of coffee u consume (1.89$), you not allowed to drive bicycles, sick time off or any personal time off at all and referred to as \"green badge\".  From the very beginning  things were rather odd.  When I started , i was left alone for about a week. No introductions to team members, no lunch , nothing. Out of boredom i wrote a 20 proposal with visuals and backing stats how to improve the software i was assigned to. Well it was completely ignored , not even response to email acknowledging its existence. Indian manager kept polite , but very distant and dint wanna hear nothing about innovations or at least upgrading .net 4.0 to something more fresh. Oh well, ok fine.  They dont use  async , solid or design patterns. The code is working , well kinda -  if you careful about clicks u good. They dont engage in technical discussions, code reviews or any kind active knowledge sharing. Tools such as Resharper ,  only out of you own pocket. Also had to bring my personal headphones and mic for conf calls. The work hours, and lunch time very strict and always had to start and finish day at the minutes precision. I was getting tired of paying for coffee and asked if i could bring my own coffee make. Nope. Long story short the place felt like prison. I cant say if all teams are like that, but mine was.  If you are contractor : run ."
