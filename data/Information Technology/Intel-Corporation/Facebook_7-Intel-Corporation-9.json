Some of the best talent in the company sees it as a stepping stone to get to better tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. Constant reorganizations in all departments takes away any feeling of job security. This in-turn makes it difficult to focus and work in a productive manner. The yearly review process pit employees against each other instead of accomplishments per the job description. Intel is one of the few companies out there that still uses a forced distribution model for yearly reviews, so there is always someone that will get a bad review even if they performed to their job expectations. Many managers there have no business being managers. They see it as a role to check off the list to become a principle engineer.

If you are unhappy with you're job or simply looking for a new challenge, there are always plenty of jobs around the country & world to transfer to. Infact you are encouraged to change jobs every 3 to 5 years. Pay is above average for lower end jobs (mail room, manufacturing assemblers, building maintenance, etc) as well as for higher end jobs (principal engineers, business unit managers, etc). For those of us in the middle, the pay is average or sometimes below average.", "cons": "The two biggest cons are; 1) constant threat of layoffs due to structure & efficiency gains, 2) middle management is clueless. I worked in one team for 8 years, during that time we had; 4 restructurings, split 2 times, merged 2 times...all those lead to 5 rounds of layoffs. The constant change in the charter of the group, type of work, and threat of losing your job is not good for moral. Add to that the fact middle management is there because they are not quslified to do the work, but they are the one doing your yealy review. it makes it very difficult to get promotions."}, {"review_title": "Interesting place to work, awesome people and great values", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Senior Software Developer Engineer in San Jose, San Jose", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting place to work, awesome people and great values", "cons": "Low compensation salary compare with the current local market conditions and profile"}, {"review_title": "Like any job, you get back what you put in.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "6 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Manufacturing Technician in Chandler, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent Benefits, Time off, Endless Overtime if wanted", "cons": "Politics are too involved these days.

Electrical design of the circuits that are printed thereon is, in the unspoken corporate opinion, a necessary evil to allow the printing of said money.  Intel expects inordinate amounts of time from electrical designers and all engineers to meet frequently RIDICULOUS schedules.  That's fine when you're young without attachments, but as you mature, start families, etc., they demand that same amount of time. Evenings and weekends are pretty much expected, though very seldom will a manager actually tell you that directly (because it's illegal, of course). <Oh, wait,now they just laid-off 15% of your work force and the schedules have not been altered (great...)>  Non-compliance is punished in the antiquated forced relative ranking that painfully occupies months each year.  Intel does NOT want older, experienced engineers; they want Recent College Graduates (or third world engineers) with no life and lots of time to spend on the really nice, company sponsored laptops.  Even if they do a crummy job, they are much cheaper to employ."}, {"review_title": "very good company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Denmark, SC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "it is a very nice employer with a very good opportunity to grow", "cons": "some times there is no work life balance"}, {"review_title": "Company review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "30 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Component Design Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance.

Basically your boss will come to solely rely on you to do everything anyone else is not doing what they are supposed to. Its so bad that you'll be only allowed to take days off only if one of the other hard workers hasn't scheduled a day off. And from what I've seen that equates to only about 20% of the team. So now you have the normal \"no more than 3 people off at a time (from the whole group of 20)\" AND \"no more than 1 person off from the group of hard workers (approx 4 people including yourself)\"."}, {"review_title": "Best benefit", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Product Development Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good environment and benefit compared to others", "cons": "overload in my department but not others"}, {"review_title": ".", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Network Engineer in Limerick, Limerick", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Cheap rent, type of work", "cons": "Location, culture, workload, high attrition"}], [{"review_title": "Good Environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Linz", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Environment and easy integration within the team", "cons": "I had a micro manager ..."}, {"review_title": "No Future", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Process Engineer in Hillsboro, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a well paying job", "cons": "No longer a tech leader"}, {"review_title": "Interesting work, big company issues", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Engineer in Albuquerque, NM", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting work, smart colleagues, great learning experience, good flexibility.", "cons": "Big company, organisational inertia, low upward mobility scope."}, {"review_title": ".", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Applications Engineer in Santa Clara, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good company benefit, flexible work hours", "cons": "Too many meetings, long work hours"}, {"review_title": "Racial Discrimination MIG", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Santa Clara, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Company HR is really great.
