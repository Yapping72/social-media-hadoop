The utilization of Agile is a joke and is mostly in place to make a team appear busy. Management is a joke. Stop having 3-hour long meetings day and night -- you are holding your employees hostage and no real work can get done. Don't expect all department employees to be in every meeting at all hours of the night when it has no value to the work they are doing or provide information that cannot be obtained through a summary email the next day. Lastly, having large hiring events to only lay off thousands of employees shortly after is horrible. Learn to hire right and retain the right staff and quit treating employees as if they are trash to be discarded anytime you need to make your numbers and pay out shareholder dividends. You should be ashamed of this habit being part of your culture now."

I have been at the company for 16months and my manager has always been intentional about ensuring that we take breaks to relax and get our mental health together. My role is fully remote and I am able to work from anywhere. What management cares about is delivering results.\r\n\r\nIntel also gives a day off every quarter for your wellness check.\r\n\r\nThe health benefits are great and the recognition program is awesome\r\n\r\nIntel is also very big on diversity and inclusion. You have a very diverse leadership team and this is a mindset that's driven from the CEO down to the smaller teams. \r\n\r\nIntel being a large company has several units, and provides opportunities for employees who want to try new things within the company. You will most likely find something that suits your interest.",

However, Intel launched an initiative at the start of 2022 to ensure its global workforce was on par with the majority of tech companies."

Old school managers will work you to death and not care if you leave. There is still a long way to go for them to achieve race or gender equity."

		"pros": "- Nice campus\r\n- Nice Amenities \r\n- Decent Benefits\r\n- Career development (glasswalled though)\r\n- Nice Cafeteria with decent food",
		"cons": "Intel may be a great place to work if you are a \"professional\" such as in IT or an engineer, but working as a technician on the fab floor is the worst job you can have at Intel, full of frustrations, aggravations and excuses from management; what techs on the floor have to deal with is emblematic of rot, stagnation and bureaucracy which are systemic causes for Intel's loss in dominance over AMD, struggles with 10nm and failure to meet critical releases like ARC.\r\n\r\nHere are overviews of major issues being a tech:\r\n\r\n- Intel offers avenues for \"career development\" but if you are a technician, being a tech really pigeonholes and stifles your career growth potential right out of the box; being a technician comes with a huge stigma that you will have to fight against, even when you apply for internal career development resources. So if you are thinking \"I will take a job as an MET to get some benefits and maybe go back to school to aspire and build a great career\" well, being and MET puts you at the edge of a career black hole from the start. So if you are an ambitious and driven person, I do not recommend taking this job as a way to getting \"your foot in the door to build a career\" for that reason alone, let alone the following below.....\r\n\r\n- high attrition; they cannot keep good technicians because the fab is a dumpster fire and hard working dedicated people get burnt out and leave, especially when you can get some other tech job +5 to +10 an hour with far less aggravation; hiring standards have gotten very low to the point that if you can turn a screwdriver, have a GED you are a candidate\r\n\r\n- high attrition and mediocre new hires feed into low quality maintenance, poor documentation, failure to order parts correctly and timely, work areas left in disarray from previous shifts having no idea how to clean up and order the workspace for the next shift; engineers are often clueless, who should know basic thermodynamics have to be trained on how systems work - and how much more money do they make than techs?\r\n\r\n- SEVERE disconnect from management, decision making and the technicians; managers and engineers are constantly changing; months and YEARS of improvement recommendations from techs go ignored or are kept on an indefinite backburner; major decisions leave technicians out of the loop, that directly affect techs and not engineers (ie - transitioning to a very heavy forced air respirator (that everyone hates) without doing any field testing and asking technicians for feedback - nope - some manager or engineer gets an idea and just shoves it on technicians to deal with)\r\n\r\n- maintenance documentation is an absolute nightmare and poorly written; since MET's are held accountable for PM's and are supposed to follow a poorly written docs to cover their butts, it will be the MET's who get blamed, not the engineers who write the docs - again, another example of the tech-engineer disconnect - and a lot of it due to bureaucracy\r\n\r\n- insufficient tools and equipment to perform routine daily tasks. Techs often spend 20 to 30 minutes wandering around the fab to find a specific type of tool and drag it all the way across the fab (which his huge) which presents potential safety hazards, damage to equipment and increased technician fatigue (lack of tools is such a hypocrisy for a company that is so \"safety and ergonomic focused\") - issues like this are YEARS in the making and go unresolved\r\n\r\n- tools are worn out and have calibration issues; often, other technicians do not return tools to where they are kept, leading to goose chases\r\n\r\n- equipment-qualified senior techs are already in short supply and have to train the new hires constantly coming in, which stresses them out since managers are relying on senior techs to get things done and address more advanced maintenance issues\r\n\r\n- training and certification systems are a dumpster fire as well - again, another disconnect between management, engineers and technicians. You just have this massive list of things to learn, half of which is irrelevant to what you actually need to know to as s technician to work on the tools. There is no \"hard tech training\" on the actual systems and components you are working on. And there is an ocean of knowledge given to you with vague structure; there is no \"study guide\" for what is actually on the certification tests\r\n\r\n- certification tests are given to you at the end of you initial training period instead of incrementally; half of it is irrelevant, written by people who don't actually work on the tools, asking technical details that are not really emphasized in the training material\r\n\r\n- already stressed and overworked senior technicians are not given guidance to train new trainees on and simply do not have the time to learn a curriculum to teach - no fault of their own\r\n\r\n- documentation is scattered all over the place; often time links change and are broken or being redesigned\r\n\r\n- software applications related to MET's tasks are awful - even if MET's know about their existence because it gets lost in the ocean of information\r\n\r\n- 12 hour days - some people love them, some hate them. If you are into health and fitness, 12 hour days will not be conducive to staying on a fitness schedule since 12 hours shift work in the fab drains you\r\n\r\n- if you take this job, you will have to deal with extremely tight walkways, workspaces and maintenance spaces. You will be constantly walking around, walking over stepping over everything and anything - and pulling and pushing heavy wheeled objects in this environment is no easy task. There are extremely tight areas while doing part replacement, where you can barely get your fingers in a cavity or gap to install components or fasteners. And then you will have to put on full-faced forced air respirators on top of that.\r\n\r\n- you will not be given a laptop and will have to use the public computers, which are absolutely horrendously slow - like 5 minutes to boot up slow; Outlook doesn't work half the time so you have to go to office.com; apps don't work well; the task bar doesn't work as expected; and people can be extremely loud in these public area, not respecting those who actually are doing work on the computer - or kicking their feet up watching You Tube videos.\r\n\r\n- culture where mediocrity is baseline mode of operation\r\n\r\n- Intel is losing focus on what is actually \"mission critical\" in the fab; for instance they place \"nanny nags\" in the dressing room to nag you over small things like badge clips when people, time, money and resources could be used to getting MET's the tools, equipment, documentation and training they need\r\n\r\n- the hourly pay is not really that good for the amount of hassles and aggravations people have to deal with BEFORE even doing highly skilled maintenance on very expensive equipment; as mentioned early, you can get other tech jobs at 5 to 10 dollars an hour more with far less aggravation and better working conditions; when you are making 20 to 25 an hour as a tech living in Hillsboro, you are nearly living hand-to mouth. But the \"allure\" of working for Intel is why they can get away with paying a relatively lower wages and get lower skilled talent - and hence so many issues in the fab\r\n\r\n- MET's are simply not respected and Intel takes them for granted by not listening to them and giving them the real training and resources they need; without MET's the fab would not run and Intel would be out of business"

Those who left used to call intel their dream jobs...ironic\r\n- Management is complacent and happy with the numbers. They don't care about losing talent as long as they can hire new college graduates to fill the vacancies. The outcome: even the core technology development department is full of newbies with insufficient knowledge and/or irrelevant background.\r\n- Very political driven culture--URM hired/promoted first whenever possible. New external hires always get fatty juicy packages yet the old employees get the bare minimum, fueling the attrition and killing the morale--thus everyone is doing as little as they possibly can.\r\n- Hardware/silicon inside Intel is a dead end, proven by the new title/pay change. SW-related jobs now earn 10% more base than HW guys. Clearly an IBM wannabe."

Job duties are very vague as if the department and company do not know what it is doing or trying to accomplish (lack of clear goals). The utilization of Agile is a joke and is mostly in place to make a team appear busy. Management is a joke. Stop having 3-hour long meetings day and night -- you are holding your employees hostage and no real work can get done. Don't expect all department employees to be in every meeting at all hours of the night when it has no value to the work they are doing or provide information that cannot be obtained through a summary email the next day. Lastly, having large hiring events to only lay off thousands of employees shortly after is horrible. Learn to hire right and retain the right staff and quit treating employees as if they are trash to be discarded anytime you need to make your numbers and pay out shareholder dividends. You should be ashamed of this habit being part of your culture now."

Only bad thing about the food service area.\r\nI found some of the annual training annoying - but it is required and helpful.\r\nYou will not just do your PRIMARY job.

The end result is they just feel like they can outsource it, and it's not worth the spend for a full timer, even though it really puts pressure on the team.\r\n\r\nExecs think they know it all. We had one who thought he was God's gift to UX. He knew nothing about it. However he cuts the checks. So when it was time to launch a product, he ruled over all the decision making, even design, with an iron fist. He by far is the worst person I have worked with in 20 years of design. Sadly, this type of person is common at Intel.\r\n\r\nLastly, layoffs, lots of them. They seem to happen in cycles at Intel. And quite frequently."

I have been at the company for 16months and my manager has always been intentional about ensuring that we take breaks to relax and get our mental health together. My role is fully remote and I am able to work from anywhere. What management cares about is delivering results.\r\n\r\nIntel also gives a day off every quarter for your wellness check.\r\n\r\nThe health benefits are great and the recognition program is awesome\r\n\r\nIntel is also very big on diversity and inclusion. You have a very diverse leadership team and this is a mindset that's driven from the CEO down to the smaller teams. \r\n\r\nIntel being a large company has several units, and provides opportunities for employees who want to try new things within the company. You will most likely find something that suits your interest.",
		"cons": "With the new CEO, Intel is currently in the phase of restructuring and not everyone might be as patient and driven to be in that space.\r\n\r\nAlthough the pay is very good, it is currently not as competitive as other tech companies in the Bay Area like Facebook and Google. However, Intel launched an initiative at the start of 2022 to ensure its global workforce was on par with the majority of tech companies."

You will have the opportunity to work with many diverse individuals from many different countries, and on projects which directly impact the bottom line if you support manufacturing. They are committed to US based manufacturing, and even though all products are finished in Asia, most of the products are built in the US before assembly. As a large company, you will be able to take the vacation days you are allotted with coverage plans in place and cooperation from management. Most managers are at least ok, and some are exceptional. They are working to rid the company of the bullies who often got all the credit for killing their teams. Sabbatical is a perk every 4 years (1 month) or 7 years (2 months) unmatched in any other private company I've seen.",
		"cons": "Don't expect world class compensation. Raises have been near 0 after inflation is taken into account for over a decade. Stock compensation makes up for some of it as does their bonus structure when stock is moving up not sideways. There will always be people who try to push you way past your limits, and it's up to you and your manager to manage your workload to be effective. Old school managers will work you to death and not care if you leave. There is still a long way to go for them to achieve race or gender equity."

		"pros": "- Nice campus\r\n- Nice Amenities \r\n- Decent Benefits\r\n- Career development (glasswalled though)\r\n- Nice Cafeteria with decent food",
		"cons": "Intel may be a great place to work if you are a \"professional\" such as in IT or an engineer, but working as a technician on the fab floor is the worst job you can have at Intel, full of frustrations, aggravations and excuses from management; what techs on the floor have to deal with is emblematic of rot, stagnation and bureaucracy which are systemic causes for Intel's loss in dominance over AMD, struggles with 10nm and failure to meet critical releases like ARC.\r\n\r\nHere are overviews of major issues being a tech:\r\n\r\n- Intel offers avenues for \"career development\" but if you are a technician, being a tech really pigeonholes and stifles your career growth potential right out of the box; being a technician comes with a huge stigma that you will have to fight against, even when you apply for internal career development resources. So if you are thinking \"I will take a job as an MET to get some benefits and maybe go back to school to aspire and build a great career\" well, being and MET puts you at the edge of a career black hole from the start. So if you are an ambitious and driven person, I do not recommend taking this job as a way to getting \"your foot in the door to build a career\" for that reason alone, let alone the following below.....\r\n\r\n- high attrition; they cannot keep good technicians because the fab is a dumpster fire and hard working dedicated people get burnt out and leave, especially when you can get some other tech job +5 to +10 an hour with far less aggravation; hiring standards have gotten very low to the point that if you can turn a screwdriver, have a GED you are a candidate\r\n\r\n- high attrition and mediocre new hires feed into low quality maintenance, poor documentation, failure to order parts correctly and timely, work areas left in disarray from previous shifts having no idea how to clean up and order the workspace for the next shift; engineers are often clueless, who should know basic thermodynamics have to be trained on how systems work - and how much more money do they make than techs?\r\n\r\n- SEVERE disconnect from management, decision making and the technicians; managers and engineers are constantly changing; months and YEARS of improvement recommendations from techs go ignored or are kept on an indefinite backburner; major decisions leave technicians out of the loop, that directly affect techs and not engineers (ie - transitioning to a very heavy forced air respirator (that everyone hates) without doing any field testing and asking technicians for feedback - nope - some manager or engineer gets an idea and just shoves it on technicians to deal with)\r\n\r\n- maintenance documentation is an absolute nightmare and poorly written; since MET's are held accountable for PM's and are supposed to follow a poorly written docs to cover their butts, it will be the MET's who get blamed, not the engineers who write the docs - again, another example of the tech-engineer disconnect - and a lot of it due to bureaucracy\r\n\r\n- insufficient tools and equipment to perform routine daily tasks. Techs often spend 20 to 30 minutes wandering around the fab to find a specific type of tool and drag it all the way across the fab (which his huge) which presents potential safety hazards, damage to equipment and increased technician fatigue (lack of tools is such a hypocrisy for a company that is so \"safety and ergonomic focused\") - issues like this are YEARS in the making and go unresolved\r\n\r\n- tools are worn out and have calibration issues; often, other technicians do not return tools to where they are kept, leading to goose chases\r\n\r\n- equipment-qualified senior techs are already in short supply and have to train the new hires constantly coming in, which stresses them out since managers are relying on senior techs to get things done and address more advanced maintenance issues\r\n\r\n- training and certification systems are a dumpster fire as well - again, another disconnect between management, engineers and technicians. You just have this massive list of things to learn, half of which is irrelevant to what you actually need to know to as s technician to work on the tools. There is no \"hard tech training\" on the actual systems and components you are working on. And there is an ocean of knowledge given to you with vague structure; there is no \"study guide\" for what is actually on the certification tests\r\n\r\n- certification tests are given to you at the end of you initial training period instead of incrementally; half of it is irrelevant, written by people who don't actually work on the tools, asking technical details that are not really emphasized in the training material\r\n\r\n- already stressed and overworked senior technicians are not given guidance to train new trainees on and simply do not have the time to learn a curriculum to teach - no fault of their own\r\n\r\n- documentation is scattered all over the place; often time links change and are broken or being redesigned\r\n\r\n- software applications related to MET's tasks are awful - even if MET's know about their existence because it gets lost in the ocean of information\r\n\r\n- 12 hour days - some people love them, some hate them. If you are into health and fitness, 12 hour days will not be conducive to staying on a fitness schedule since 12 hours shift work in the fab drains you\r\n\r\n- if you take this job, you will have to deal with extremely tight walkways, workspaces and maintenance spaces. You will be constantly walking around, walking over stepping over everything and anything - and pulling and pushing heavy wheeled objects in this environment is no easy task. There are extremely tight areas while doing part replacement, where you can barely get your fingers in a cavity or gap to install components or fasteners. And then you will have to put on full-faced forced air respirators on top of that.\r\n\r\n- you will not be given a laptop and will have to use the public computers, which are absolutely horrendously slow - like 5 minutes to boot up slow; Outlook doesn't work half the time so you have to go to office.com; apps don't work well; the task bar doesn't work as expected; and people can be extremely loud in these public area, not respecting those who actually are doing work on the computer - or kicking their feet up watching You Tube videos.\r\n\r\n- culture where mediocrity is baseline mode of operation\r\n\r\n- Intel is losing focus on what is actually \"mission critical\" in the fab; for instance they place \"nanny nags\" in the dressing room to nag you over small things like badge clips when people, time, money and resources could be used to getting MET's the tools, equipment, documentation and training they need\r\n\r\n- the hourly pay is not really that good for the amount of hassles and aggravations people have to deal with BEFORE even doing highly skilled maintenance on very expensive equipment; as mentioned early, you can get other tech jobs at 5 to 10 dollars an hour more with far less aggravation and better working conditions; when you are making 20 to 25 an hour as a tech living in Hillsboro, you are nearly living hand-to mouth. But the \"allure\" of working for Intel is why they can get away with paying a relatively lower wages and get lower skilled talent - and hence so many issues in the fab\r\n\r\n- MET's are simply not respected and Intel takes them for granted by not listening to them and giving them the real training and resources they need; without MET's the fab would not run and Intel would be out of business"

Stock benefits (RSUs) are massively underpaid compared to what other companies are giving out these days.

After that, it was anything goes.\r\n\r\nAlso, and this may sound counterintuitive, but it's easy to get comfortable here. The perks are that good. So people lose their edge a bit.

They don't care about losing talent as long as they can hire new college graduates to fill the vacancies. The outcome: even the core technology development department is full of newbies with insufficient knowledge and/or irrelevant background.\r\n- Very political driven culture--URM hired/promoted first whenever possible. New external hires always get fatty juicy packages yet the old employees get the bare minimum, fueling the attrition and killing the morale--thus everyone is doing as little as they possibly can.\r\n- Hardware/silicon inside Intel is a dead end, proven by the new title/pay change.
