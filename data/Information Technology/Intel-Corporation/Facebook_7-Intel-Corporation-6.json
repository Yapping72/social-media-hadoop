Pay may or may not be competitive, see note below about inside of IT.\r\n\r\nIf you're female and especially a person of color, you'll have a really good chance of being hired, regardless of experience. The emphasis on diversity is strong. Years ago (before this recent push!) we were told that out of the candidates who applied, if we did not choose the woman, we had to justify that to a VP. A VP mind you that has no idea what we actually need. There used to be crazy large referral bonuses the more unique of a hire you could find. Get that koosh large company job, find a nice place to settle in and eventually become a manager that is simply just a warm body in a chair.", "cons": "The IT organization is mismanaged and horrible. Some of the main culture pillars include \"customer orientation\" and everything in IT goes against that. Nobody has faith when you're told to \"go to it.intel.com and submit a ticket\" that it's going to be done properly. The system doesn't allow for easy rerouting. It's full of third world support people shoving tickets around, not understanding the issues. Anything above \"can you turn it off and on again\" type stuff is an absolute joke. This same system is what everyone uses be it \"my laptop won't turn on\" to a huge advanced IT project's support. The lower tiers have no idea what those things are and usually the ticket is DOA.\r\n\r\nLet's not forget the push to SAFe. What a joke! Our fearless CIO Paula introduced it as part of this \"digital transformation\" and it's been a slow burning dumpster fire. Classes forced on how the process is supposed to work (designed by an amazing third party vendor!) and then immediately thrown out because Intel wants to do things \"their way\" anyway. The consistent \"one size fits all\" approach coming from the top down (while simultaneously wanting us to \"be fearless\" and challenge the status quo and all that) stifles real innovation or ability to meet specific needs with the right solutions. I could go on for years, but they've done two rounds now of large amounts of IT layoffs in the last 3 years alone, and I've had 6 or 7 managers in that time. I did enjoy my job well enough for many years outside of IT. The company itself is known for high stress, in general. Add to that the IT organization's continuous desire to cut costs and eventually heads when there's no more costs to cut... why would you want to work there?\r\n\r\nAlso, funny tidbit - the IT organization pays less for the same exact job that is located elsewhere in the company. Not that any of those really exist, since geniuses at the top decided that everyone who does IT work should be in the IT organization. Remember: one size fits all. If it doesn't fit, it will eventually. Think square peg in round hole being jammed in there until one side breaks.\r\n\r\nAnother con, probably true of any large company - too many managers, too much management. We have new VPs every month. It's insane. We have the wrong people doing things all over the place. People who have no clue making certain decisions but are empowered to make them anyway. Or \"skilled\" labor that can't seem to even form a single thought. I don't know how some of these people can even find the bathroom without assistance.\r\n\r\nWhen I was hired, I was given stock options. They expired before they were ever worth anything. Nowadays they issue RSUs for things, which are much better. But I was stuck getting absolutely nothing for my hiring \"bonus\"\r\n\r\nTo summarize: this is not a place you want to work if you're going to be inside of the IT organization. Inside of a business group, sure, it can be alright. Manufacturing, sure. But IT?

We are not always first and not always the best at everything. But we keep going and what we put out had the opportunity to changes lives around the world. I love that.

What I am against is having it thrown at me every day and tying my pay to it. There should not be bonus kickers that relate to diverse hiring - that is nothing I can control nor should it be there at all. I am still old school where you hire the best person for the job and then investigate why one manager seems to hire only 40 year old white male. Go after people that offend vs telling a manager a diverse candidate is the requirement when the non-diverse candidate is clearly the better choice. I have been on hiring panels where that was forced on me so no one can tell me it is not happening.

Pay may or may not be competitive, see note below about inside of IT.\r\n\r\nIf you're female and especially a person of color, you'll have a really good chance of being hired, regardless of experience. The emphasis on diversity is strong. Years ago (before this recent push!) we were told that out of the candidates who applied, if we did not choose the woman, we had to justify that to a VP. A VP mind you that has no idea what we actually need. There used to be crazy large referral bonuses the more unique of a hire you could find. Get that koosh large company job, find a nice place to settle in and eventually become a manager that is simply just a warm body in a chair.", "cons": "The IT organization is mismanaged and horrible. Some of the main culture pillars include \"customer orientation\" and everything in IT goes against that. Nobody has faith when you're told to \"go to it.intel.com and submit a ticket\" that it's going to be done properly. The system doesn't allow for easy rerouting. It's full of third world support people shoving tickets around, not understanding the issues. Anything above \"can you turn it off and on again\" type stuff is an absolute joke. This same system is what everyone uses be it \"my laptop won't turn on\" to a huge advanced IT project's support. The lower tiers have no idea what those things are and usually the ticket is DOA.\r\n\r\nLet's not forget the push to SAFe. What a joke! Our fearless CIO Paula introduced it as part of this \"digital transformation\" and it's been a slow burning dumpster fire. Classes forced on how the process is supposed to work (designed by an amazing third party vendor!) and then immediately thrown out because Intel wants to do things \"their way\" anyway. The consistent \"one size fits all\" approach coming from the top down (while simultaneously wanting us to \"be fearless\" and challenge the status quo and all that) stifles real innovation or ability to meet specific needs with the right solutions. I could go on for years, but they've done two rounds now of large amounts of IT layoffs in the last 3 years alone, and I've had 6 or 7 managers in that time. I did enjoy my job well enough for many years outside of IT. The company itself is known for high stress, in general. Add to that the IT organization's continuous desire to cut costs and eventually heads when there's no more costs to cut... why would you want to work there?\r\n\r\nAlso, funny tidbit - the IT organization pays less for the same exact job that is located elsewhere in the company. Not that any of those really exist, since geniuses at the top decided that everyone who does IT work should be in the IT organization. Remember: one size fits all. If it doesn't fit, it will eventually. Think square peg in round hole being jammed in there until one side breaks.\r\n\r\nAnother con, probably true of any large company - too many managers, too much management. We have new VPs every month. It's insane. We have the wrong people doing things all over the place. People who have no clue making certain decisions but are empowered to make them anyway. Or \"skilled\" labor that can't seem to even form a single thought. I don't know how some of these people can even find the bathroom without assistance.\r\n\r\nWhen I was hired, I was given stock options. They expired before they were ever worth anything. Nowadays they issue RSUs for things, which are much better. But I was stuck getting absolutely nothing for my hiring \"bonus\"\r\n\r\nTo summarize: this is not a place you want to work if you're going to be inside of the IT organization. Inside of a business group, sure, it can be alright. Manufacturing, sure. But IT?
