		"cons": "I worked for Oregon Die Prep (ODP) from July 2017 to February 2022 and for 13 months prior to that as a temp. They terminated my employment while I was on medical leave for covid related illness. They didn\u2019t even tell me; I had to find out through their supplier, Reedgroup. This is ironic because I believe I was fired for making a complaint about said supplier. They cover short term disability benefits for Intel. I made a complaint to Intel about them violating my HIPAA rights and because it took them over seven months to pay me benefits while I was dealing with covid related medical issues. During this time, I suffered from financial hardship and informed both my manager and HR representative of these issues. Nothing was done to assist me. My manager literally ignored me; I could not get a hold of them while calling them every workday, all while my work profile was removed from my phone so I couldn\u2019t contact any coworkers. My HR representative (who had known about the issues I had been having for over six months at this point) told me that my complaints were escalated and they would call me back with information. I never received that call and my employment was terminated the next day. My HR representative then gaslit me through email. They said Intel looked into my concerns with Reedgroup and essentially considered it a non-issue. I don\u2019t believe my complaints where ever escalated and I was terminated without Intel ever acknowledging my complaints about their supplier. \r\nI was my team lead, had nothing but good reviews, worked very closely with management as a back up when they needed assistance, and achieved the highest-level certification on various toolsets. This is still the way they treated me. I was able to get a hold of a mid-level manager who was a mentor of mine and explain my situation to them. They basically told me to kick rocks. I would advise anyone looking to get into manufacturing at Intel to avoid Oregon Die Prep at all costs, unless you want all the work and effort put into your career at Intel to be in vain."

The team saw the potential, and then helped me take advantage of that potential, eventually getting to the point where I was designing the networks for the next generation facilities. When it was time for me to do something else, I moved to a very different organization that needed some of my previous skills, but then helped me learn about their role.",

Go look at the latest GoPc commercial on YouTube and read the comments. Yet, if you inside intel you\u2019ll hear nothing about praise and promotions. While women have significant roles at the company and are promoted, the way some of them are spoken to and treated by their male counterparts is outright inappropriate and demeaning. \n\nBut like any abusive relationship many people have a hard time leaving. It\u2019s almost like a cult. The company does a good job by instilling the #IAMINTEL into people. I mean really, who are we as human beings if we don\u2019t tie our identity into our corporate life, right?"

If you made some processing error or other misjudgment you will be targeted for unsatisfactory performance in the next review period. If you are ranked low enough you will face an IR (improvement required) and be subjected to an embarrassing level of corrective action on top of your current workload. They reward you with more work. If you are nearing retirement you will be targeted. They don't fire employees outright. They make their lives miserable until they cannot take it anymore and then leave. Once you leave you are blacklisted and can never return (though I'm not sure why you would). Engineers literally work 24/7. I was required to call them in the middle of the night and they had to come in. IF the problem was resolved they could go home, get a short nap, and still have to show up for passdown in the fab at 7am. I would try to talk my worst enemy out of working at Intel."

Great teamwork in the business units I was involved in. Most of the company core values were reasonable and decent. It's a good place to learn as an engineer if you find the right team and manager.",
		"cons": "Intel periodically makes drastic blunders, not unusual for such large companies. For example, the 2016 ACT layoffs laid off huge numbers of people to get to a fixed bottom line without any consideration for outstanding performance (like laying off anyone working remote) or relevance to work being done or objections from local teams; they forced ridiculous site consolidations that looked good on paper but ruined team dynamics; they underwent endless reorganizations that were disruptive, and they canceled good projects if they stopped being flavor of the week. They don't know what to do with some of the smaller business units that aren't in the core business, so these get beaten up by corporate management politics and resource reallocations (robbing Peter to pay Paul). In more recent years, they've been infected by some of the woke nonsense - I once received a moronic training deck for pretty standard technical words that I wasn't supposed to use anymore (like not being allowed to use the word \"master\" in any technical context). Most annual trainings were pretty standard and even thorough, but periodically they had optional woke offerings like preventing microaggressions. If you get in with a good team, you can usually overlook that stuff, but it can be aggravating when you really want to be focused on making a great product. Also: I occasionally encountered people who job hopped within the company just to get advancement and were never really committed to their projects or teams. They'd talk big, stick around for a year or two, and then bail before becoming real contributors. I guess it's a trade-off, because the same internal job structure that enables the hopping can be handy if your unit gets lay off notices and you need to find a new home in a hurry."

Not many companies do this; this makes Intel stand out from other companies.\n\nWhen hired on, get to know your manager.

They terminated my employment while I was on medical leave for covid related illness. They didn\u2019t even tell me; I had to find out through their supplier, Reedgroup. This is ironic because I believe I was fired for making a complaint about said supplier. They cover short term disability benefits for Intel. I made a complaint to Intel about them violating my HIPAA rights and because it took them over seven months to pay me benefits while I was dealing with covid related medical issues. During this time, I suffered from financial hardship and informed both my manager and HR representative of these issues. Nothing was done to assist me. My manager literally ignored me; I could not get a hold of them while calling them every workday, all while my work profile was removed from my phone so I couldn\u2019t contact any coworkers. My HR representative (who had known about the issues I had been having for over six months at this point) told me that my complaints were escalated and they would call me back with information. I never received that call and my employment was terminated the next day. My HR representative then gaslit me through email. They said Intel looked into my concerns with Reedgroup and essentially considered it a non-issue. I don\u2019t believe my complaints where ever escalated and I was terminated without Intel ever acknowledging my complaints about their supplier. \r\nI was my team lead, had nothing but good reviews, worked very closely with management as a back up when they needed assistance, and achieved the highest-level certification on various toolsets. This is still the way they treated me. I was able to get a hold of a mid-level manager who was a mentor of mine and explain my situation to them. They basically told me to kick rocks. I would advise anyone looking to get into manufacturing at Intel to avoid Oregon Die Prep at all costs, unless you want all the work and effort put into your career at Intel to be in vain."

The team saw the potential, and then helped me take advantage of that potential, eventually getting to the point where I was designing the networks for the next generation facilities.

While women have significant roles at the company and are promoted, the way some of them are spoken to and treated by their male counterparts is outright inappropriate and demeaning. \n\nBut like any abusive relationship many people have a hard time leaving. It\u2019s almost like a cult. The company does a good job by instilling the #IAMINTEL into people.

When I mentioned the large pay discrepancy to HR/Hiring Manager they then said I would actually be a Grade 003, and they needed to resend a new offer. When I told them I applied for a Grade 005 position, the Hiring manager then stated Grade 005 and Grade 003 have the same pay rate (~71k) so it actually doesn\u2019t matter.

If you made some processing error or other misjudgment you will be targeted for unsatisfactory performance in the next review period. If you are ranked low enough you will face an IR (improvement required) and be subjected to an embarrassing level of corrective action on top of your current workload. They reward you with more work. If you are nearing retirement you will be targeted. They don't fire employees outright. They make their lives miserable until they cannot take it anymore and then leave. Once you leave you are blacklisted and can never return (though I'm not sure why you would). Engineers literally work 24/7. I was required to call them in the middle of the night and they had to come in. IF the problem was resolved they could go home, get a short nap, and still have to show up for passdown in the fab at 7am. I would try to talk my worst enemy out of working at Intel."

		"pros": "There's lots of great reasons to work at Intel, salary and benefits are some of the best I have seen thus far at my age. I could see myself working here for years to come, which I haven't had in a workplace before now. The biggest one has been the culture here at work. Everyone is has been incredibly patient and helpful while I learn the ropes in my role, and there's a generally very warm atmosphere in the office, even on our busiest days. There's a great community here to make solid roots. And immense encouragement for personal growth and development if you wish to learn more or branch out. I also love the longer weekends, with my shift rotating between 3-4 days a week.",
		"cons": "No real cons thus far. But two key points to note. Your health and your time are important. Have a commute planned out in advance. It's important to have a plan in place for your route in and out so you're on time for shifts and passdown meetings. And if remote working is a necessity due to circumstances, to have that conversation with your manager in advance of needing to work remotely so you have everything you need. The site is a big place, so familiarizing your route and then your walk from your car/bus/train, is a big one, especially if you are like me and work 7 to 7. It's important to take ownership of your time and how you spend it, whether it's a task you've been assigned, getting the sleep you need before your shift or being on time. It's very active here on site, so balancing your time between work and self care is important. When I first started I was winded just from taking the stairs up two floors and walking from one end of the site to the other. Minding your health and managing your time well just makes everyday life a lot easier. And I found I've been keeping time and minding my own health a lot better since I started."

		"cons": "Intel periodically makes drastic blunders, not unusual for such large companies. For example, the 2016 ACT layoffs laid off huge numbers of people to get to a fixed bottom line without any consideration for outstanding performance (like laying off anyone working remote) or relevance to work being done or objections from local teams; they forced ridiculous site consolidations that looked good on paper but ruined team dynamics; they underwent endless reorganizations that were disruptive, and they canceled good projects if they stopped being flavor of the week. They don't know what to do with some of the smaller business units that aren't in the core business, so these get beaten up by corporate management politics and resource reallocations (robbing Peter to pay Paul). In more recent years, they've been infected by some of the woke nonsense - I once received a moronic training deck for pretty standard technical words that I wasn't supposed to use anymore (like not being allowed to use the word \"master\" in any technical context). Most annual trainings were pretty standard and even thorough, but periodically they had optional woke offerings like preventing microaggressions. If you get in with a good team, you can usually overlook that stuff, but it can be aggravating when you really want to be focused on making a great product. Also: I occasionally encountered people who job hopped within the company just to get advancement and were never really committed to their projects or teams. They'd talk big, stick around for a year or two, and then bail before becoming real contributors. I guess it's a trade-off, because the same internal job structure that enables the hopping can be handy if your unit gets lay off notices and you need to find a new home in a hurry."

Nearly every meeting starts out with safety and when there is a safety incident it is reviewed and everyone reviews the incident and reviews to see if they are at risk. Intel says they want you to leave work the same way you came in and I believe it.\r\n\r\nThey say they care about quality and they really do (almost annoyingly so). After safety they talk about quality. If there is a quality event they talk about it. Are other groups at risk? Lets fix it before it is a quality event for us. Everyone comes together and fixes it and no finger pointing is happening.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey say they care about work-life-balance and they really do. Nobody is on-call all the time and management has periodic meetings talking about your workload and even if there are things going on outside work that might interfere with your work (if you want to share). If the current job role doesnt work for some reason then they very well may try to find you a different job role within the company. They say they care about you as a person and they really do.\r\n\r\nThe pay is pretty good and they are always trying to do other things like team builders (both internally to the team and \"bring your family\"). Insurance is pretty good (not the best I've had, but pretty close). Time off - vacation, temporary, or long term - is there if you need it.\r\n\r\nAnd most importantly, generally everyone there is respectful. Even if you are totally lost and \"should\" know something people are generally more likely to try to get you up to speed versus talking down to you.",
		"cons": "While working there I thought things were annoying or bad but after leaving and working somewhere else Intel is a shining beacon. If I had to complain about anything it would be that when you have dead weight on your team (i.e. they quit coming to work, never contribute, and you just generally wonder how in the world they are still there occupying a headcount spot) Intel is VERY corporate in how they handle such matters. It takes a very long time for people to get fired - even when they are blatantly a bad worker. This can cause some stress on the team as you are effectively expected to pick up their slack while they remain \"on your team.\""
