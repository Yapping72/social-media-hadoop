Saying so... the better you become the most likely they will NOT approve your vacations because guess what? they are always short on people so since you are a valuable asset for the company (since you do more than average people) they will excuse on the fact that there are not enough qualified people as you. As I said before it depends a lot on the shift, if you get lucky you may be on a decent shift that would allow you to grow but at the same time they will respect your breaks/lunch but if not well... you know what to expect.

To their credit one of the Intel benefits is a sabbatical every four to seven years, but it's common for people to push those out as far as they can due to an underlying pressure to perform."

Saying so... the better you become the most likely they will NOT approve your vacations because guess what? they are always short on people so since you are a valuable asset for the company (since you do more than average people) they will excuse on the fact that there are not enough qualified people as you. As I said before it depends a lot on the shift, if you get lucky you may be on a decent shift that would allow you to grow but at the same time they will respect your breaks/lunch but if not well... you know what to expect. I have been on both sides and trust me you do NOT want to be in a bad shift but if you are new to intel you will not be able to tell so do your research if you know someone inside before accepting the job unless you like to be under a lot of pressure."
