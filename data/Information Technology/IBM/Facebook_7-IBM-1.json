The warmness and kindness of literally everyone I've met in IBM is the most positive virus going round 3. My opportunity to expand my network on LinkedIn with hundreds of other IBMers and senior leading figures in other companies too 4. Flexible working and truly understanding people and clients (if you have a good reason to not be able to travel to client site, then its perfectly fine) 5. The diversity and inclusion is amazing which allows all to grow as an individual and professionally 6. The experiences and opportunities are never-ending and company benefits are second-to-none you just wouldn't find elsewhere in other large tech firms 7. Your peers and management have always got your back and the best intentions in mind 8.

Balancing your day-to-day work tasks on top of your apprenticeship learning can easily get too overwhelming (but there is support and help with that) 2. Your work-life balance can too easily go into the air especially as a young person with often (assumed) little responsibilities to take care of (but for those who do or are getting tired of constant travel for instance are able to take a break in their favour) 3. Reviews, reviews, reviews, and paperwork. It is no surprise there can be a fair amoun of paperwork involved in any job, you aren't taking life seriosuly if you think there can be a minimal or no amount of it. It does feel like with some of the work (not many, and they only happen 2x a year and a lot just applies to Consulting, not elsewhere in IBM) at first is a little unnecessary but can easily become a big drag to try get done by the deadlines. As an apprentice it is made 10x easier with the contract and resources at the ready so not much to state here. Really though I think these are more just trivial personal matters that I haven't seen much of the rest of the real world of work (in tech) yet so take these as a pinch of salt. There are overwhelmingly far more positives than negatives and if you want to go to uni but not be in debt/or not sure if you have the grades for it then Level 4 with IBM is the BEST place to be.

Many managers that I am aware of, and my own manager too, have no clue about what they are doing, they are very restrictive, micromanaging, don\u00b4t listen to their people, and everything needs to be done THEIR way..

No flexibility in working from another country, and they recently informed us about some \"IRISH NEWS\" which states that supposedly Sales people cannot work a SINGLE DAY in another country... They really think their employees are not smart enough to KNOW this is just a BIG LIE!!! and instead of saying: IBM DOES NOT WANT you to work from another country, they just make a laughable LIE and pretend all of us fall for it.
