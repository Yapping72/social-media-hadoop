My development job at IBM is a very small amount of the work I do, I do more for IBM outside of my lab/office just in the external giveback and working with outside organizations and groups.\r\n-Work Life Balance - I think it's termed \"integration\" now, which i prefer, I've raised three kids here, it's never a perfect balance but that's ideal, because I get time to work when I need it but also time to drop kids off at school, go to kids sports/games, and help with homework.  I do work a lot, but it's driven by me.  There's tons of projects and things I do when the kids go to sleep or on a quiet evening because I love to do this stuff, and that's just me. \r\n-Community outreach- there's a huge sense of giveback at IBM.  IBM has a portal for registering volunteering and giveback and gives grants to organizations you work with.  IBM encourages and gives us a lot of autonomy on this so there's no real limit to how much you can work outside of IBM giving back to community as long as it doesn't interfere with your business commitments, and they will provide computing/tech resources/educational kits to help support it.\r\n-Mentoring/networking-the most underated feature of IBM is mentoring, as a senior engineer  we're encouraged to be mentors to junior engineers, and while it's not required, it's extremely helpful to have a mentor, it's allowed me to navigate and plan my career progression based on their advice and experience.  Because you're in charge of your career the mentoring is the perfect amount of coaching and self-accountability that I need to stay motivated and on track in my career goals.\r\n-People- People are awesome, I've worked with many people who work tirelessly with time they don't have to help me, or other people, to work with high school groups, to help people they don't even know within IBM who need help.  The part that makes IBM culture and values amazing is every single person you meet who is a living embodiment to them.\r\n-Overall - The thing I love about IBM is that there's so much to do, I'm never bored, and always feel like I have an impact, but most importantly I feel like my impact is greater outside the company, and helping make the world better by being me and defining how I can give back to my community and help others. Is the pay comparable to the other big companies trying to recruit me?  No, but like Kingpin said \"It's not always about the money Spider-Man\"", "cons": "-Big-, IBM is B-I-G, so there's no list of steps for things like career progression, establishing internal support groups (like a gaming group for example), how to establish a community outreach event, etc. and that's mostly because no one defines what/how you do any of that, and really the way it's done is different for everyone so it's really up to you to figure out how to do all that. \r\n-Money - They pay well, is it great?  Not compared to the giants like Facebook, netflix, or Google, I've talked to those companies just to know what a move would look like and the money difference can be quite big if that's your motivation.\r\n-Getting things done- I'm not sure I would do anything different for this given IBM's size, but IBM has a much more organic approach to starting things, getting things done, innovating side projects and community outreach etc, where you can start groups and projects you're passionate about, but you have to gather the support for it, you can get support and funding, but you have to originate the idea and figure out how to make it work and do the leg work for it, which is great if you're a type A personality and passionate about something.  But also means you become the project manager, recruiter, and communications person for your particular cause so its easy to take on too much at times."}, {"review_title": "New York Armonk Oldies need to leave IBM !!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "19 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Advisory Software Engineer in Foster City, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very talented and smart people , amazing  collection of technologies , ocean of opportunity to learn technology  , great culture and work is more of fun if you live technical challenges", "cons": "New York Armonk oldies and CFO killing the company , Imagine they were able to frustrate Warren Buffet who dumped IBM stocks ...IBM execs are more focused on stock buyback and financial engineering to manipulate quarterly results  then actually giving control to new generation of smart folks .  \r\n  Ginni and her gang would drown this company soon ...they need to leave with all millionaire execs sitting in New York and some smart young executive from outside IBM need to come in to change the top management layer ."}, {"review_title": "Stay away from it unless you are a masochist", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Jun 2008", "job_title": "Senior IT Specialist in Copenhagen, Capital Region", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They pay you a salary, when you work for them.

All parts of IBM unfortunately scramble to meet short term financial objectives and Research is very often called for help, which takes researchers away from their primary roles of inventing and innovating game changing technologies and methods. By definition, research means investing time and money in high risk high reward problems. For instance, Watson was developed over quite a few years with dozens of people involved. That is what it takes to create serious technologies. Watson team had the few lucky researchers. Unfortunately, many researchers find themselves in a situation where they are asked to help the other parts of IBM improve their bottom line. Since other parts of IBM provide research its funding, they have a lot of influence on defining research projects and therefore how researchers spend their time. Since they are hard pressed to meet their financial objectives, they tend to define projects that help their short term financial goals. Such projects are almost always less innovative and tend to have marginal value for the company. IBM researchers are very capable people. IBM hires the very best to its Research. However, under so much pressure to help IBM's bottom line and do it fast, it is hard for researchers to come up with earth shaking innovations, though they would be perfectly capable to do so if they were given some breathing room.

Another downside is the fact that even within the studio, the real goal is just getting to a place where design best practices can be applied, not pushing the field of design forward. There is no need for real innovation or flair, just for applying techniques that were worked out ten years ago to problems defined years before that.

People have this misconception that CbDers are their assistants, and will treat you as such, making you schedule meetings, book conference rooms, upload a document onto Box. There's no analytical or critical thinking required whatsoever, and definitely don't expect to be challenged. \r\n- LONG DURATION OF PROJECTS: IBM projects run longer than typical consulting firms, usually ranging from 6-9 months. Again, because they are mostly implementation-type work, you'll be doing the same thing (e.g. testing) the whole time. Don't expect that much exposure to different industries or types of projects. Your first project pretty much pigeon-holes you to do the same thing for the rest of your career, unless you really fight HARD to get onto something you want.\r\n- LACK OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT: in the CbD program, you have 3 mandatory trainings. They're a lot of fun, because you get to hang out with people in your start class. However, the stuff you learn is absolutely useless for your job. They hire a third party vendor to conduct these sessions. They teach you things like how to present better, but it's useless because you'll never be given an opportunity to present to anyone.\r\n- CONSTANT REORG: there's been I think 3 (?) reorgs during the 2 years that I've worked here, both GBS-wide and CbD-specific. Despite IBM being an established corporation, the consulting arm is still relatively young (acquired from PwC a few years ago), so it almost feels as if we're going through the growing pains of a young company... just a general lack of clear direction and constantly shifting corporate strategy.\r\n- LAYOFFS: during my time here, I've seen maybe 3 rounds of layoffs, which has affected people that were on my team, as well as people in my start class (yeah, THAT young). If you think you're immune from layoffs because you're a fresh college grad, think again. No one's safe here, and everyone's always on edge.\r\n- OUTDATED INTERNAL TECHNOLOGIES: it's embarrassing how bad IBM internal technologies are being that we boast we're at the forefront of technology. Most tools employees use (expense system, travel booking system, lotus notes) SUCK.

They believe that you learn by doing, and this environment is conducive to a less-pressured approach to just learn, and succeed when you do go on quota.\r\n\r\nQuality of peer group: There are tons of smart, hard-working, and very nice employees. For me, the people that I work with are great. They challenge me and do so positively.\r\n\r\nInterview: I spoke with an IBM representative at a college networking event, completed a phone interview, and attended a hiring event that gave more information about IBM, included 4 interviews, and a team presentation. I was given an offer a month later.\r\n\r\nCommunity culture: IBM is changing a lot. Before really understanding IBM, I had a skewed view of the culture. It is a great culture for me: collaborative, hard-working, and generally trying to improve as people.", "cons": "Training effectiveness: This program is really tailored to client-facing sellers. There is a gap in training for digital sellers. There is training that is supplemental for digital sellers, but it can be improved to greater address learning gaps.\r\n\r\nMentorship: None.\r\n\r\nHow Summits are treated: Some sellers will be hired directly onto teams. Others will need to get the job at IBM, and then they will need to connect with a team to work for after training. It is a little frustrating to think about and act on, but is definitely good practice to connect with a lot of other people at IBM.\r\n\r\nShadowing experiences: If you ask, you can find good experiences, but you have to provide value if you can. \r\n\r\nSales training & curriculum: N/A.\r\n\r\nHands-on (in-field) experience: It would be nice to have set in-field experience, but this really depends on the teams which is why it isn't scheduled as part of the official training.\r\n\r\nQuality of peer group: Some may not enjoy or click with their group. There are a lot of people that work at IBM.\r\n\r\nTeaching team: N/A\r\n\r\nManagement style and effectiveness: There may be some micro-managing, but it depends on your team and manager.\r\n\r\nInterview: It was frustrating in terms of timeline. They would not be very good at communicating what was happening. I received duplicate messages from different people, and some logistical conflicts. I suggest being proactive about reaching out to your contacts to confirm next steps, follow up, and stay top-of-mind for the recruiters. I wouldn't just bother them, but show them that you are committed and able to provide value by reiterating your fit at IBM. It was also a very rigorous process during the hiring process.\r\n\r\nCommunity culture: A lot of working here is learning how to find and work with people internally. Some sellers may not want to share information because they will be worried about you taking over the client relationship or it is not worth their time to help you with a deal. I say this because working here has another layer of learning how to be effective internally."}, {"review_title": "The once-great IBM", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "21 Oct 2016", "job_title": "Advisory Software Engineer in Research Triangle Park, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Newest technology, industry leader -- IBM was always \"THE\" company to go to work for.

The company has been around for well over 100 years, and it still runs like an old company, with numerous levels of management slowly drip-feeding decisions through a painfully dense bureaucratic process. IBM is slow to react, and when your primary competition are billion-dollar newcomers with better brand recognition, that's not a sustainable position.\r\n\r\n* Over-reliance on archaic first-party software and systems. I get it, it looks bad if you sell your own email client but use someone else's, but maybe that's just a sign that Notes is a failed product and we should cut our losses and let Microsoft take the .01% market share we're occupying, because Outlook/Exchange is better at everything we set out to do. This applies to a number of areas of concern.\r\n\r\n* Inadequate compensation. There's no getting around it: IBM pays below industry average in any given area, for any given skill level in any given field. Other benefits are pretty average for the industry, so the argument that they're making up for the low dollar figure in other ways doesn't hold up anymore. Career advancement within the technical side caps out really quickly, and the only way to continue your development is by going into management, which is far more stress than it's worth.\r\n\r\n* Cultural dissonance. As IBM has made a number of acquisitions in recent years, it's failed to integrate the company cultures of those acquisitions into itself, particularly taking the good from them. Instead, it pushes a preexisting central IBM culture that isn't compatible with the way many of these smaller companies' employees are used to operating. As a result, these employees continue to see themselves as employees of other companies and not as part of IBM, and it creates an us-vs-them mentality in the organization as a whole.\r\n\r\n* No clear plan. While we hear all the time about \"strategic imperatives\" and other buzzwords, the fact is, no plan seems to stay in place longer than a couple of quarters, and we're not gaining any ground against our ever-stronger competition. In fact, IBM is still on a negative growth trend. Everyone knows about Watson, but it's still not making us any money, so what's the plan?\r\n\r\n* Self-congratulatory management. Various managers and executives are constantly sending out emails and lectures about how IBM is doing so great innovating in x field over y period of time, which while dubious is understandable. However, every other manager uses the opportunity to suck up to the exec in question. Call it corporate politics, but no manager is willing to tell his boss when they're wrong. It rolls downhill in a way I've never seen elsewhere.\r\n\r\n* Ginni Rometty. I always say, anything that happens at a company can be blamed on the CEO. In IBM's case, we've had Ginni for the last 12 years, and of that time, just about half of it has been spent on a constant decline. All the while, Ginni waxes on about her strategic imperatives and how they're going to Make IBM Great Again. Prior to being the CEO, she worked in strategic outsourcing, and everyone who could tell her things she doesn't want to hear, which could help make decisions that would improve our standing, is well aware of that history.

Once you get out there you will work 60-70 hours a week, and it might take you 5 years to get to a level of income where you're just breaking even due to the market prices out there.  \r\n\r\n3) Environment - Rochester absolutely sucks and becomes depressing after the first year.  If you like small towns you might object to that statement.  Your first year might seem cool working with other twenty-somethings out of college, but after a few years you'll realize that an environment where people wear shorts to work and play foosball all day is not a place where you can further your career.

(No joke).  \r\n\r\n4) Cost Cutting - IBM manages their expenses very closely which means you do not get the leisure of having them pay for work outings, business cards, or other sensible acts of corporate kindness when you're working on Saturday's and Sunday's.  After I left the company, I was told that the Rochester COE would no longer be getting their offices cleaned or their trash taken out (employees have to take their own trash out!).  So it looks like not only are you a financial analyst now, but you're a part-time janitor as well.  \r\n\r\nThe above might make it seem like I hate IBM, but I really do not.  It's a great company....for shareholders.  If you can commit three years of your life here you will become very marketable and make a decent sum of money if you opt to work elsewhere."}, {"review_title": "Bureaucratic giant focused on cost reductions and controls", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 Apr 2012", "job_title": "Planner in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits are decent and generally speaking I found it easy to get personal time off when needed. My organization was spread out across the globe, so while I worked at an IBM office, I could work from home whenever I needed/wanted.", "cons": "After 34 years I was selected to participate in a \"Resource Action\". I was given 30 days to find another job or be out the door. (I was out the door.) These RAs, always the end of the second month of a quarter, are designed to lower costs quickly. They are a common occurrence and because there are so many organizations the overall numbers are never high enough to get media coverage. It is a cloud over every employee's head. \r\n\r\nExecutive management doesn't want to hear bad news, so middle management will spin any problem to save themselves. Even bad programs/products get out the door, the management in charge get their awards and move up and out before stuff hits the fan. Then new management has to fix the problem that they didn't cause.\r\n\r\nNon-performing employees are kept around because headcount is so micromanaged that if someone is let go, there's a good chance that there will never be a backfill. So, managers are continually faced with the problem of keeping a bad performer around just to save the spot or save it until they're forced to make an RA selection. \r\n\r\nExpenses are micro-managed. In my Group, if you asked for $8 business cards, you had to go through reviews and get half a dozen upper managers to okay it - oh, and provide a list of external customers that you interfaced with to prove that the cards would be used in a clear revenue opportunity. Just before I left, the edict came out from CHQ - no external monitors or minidocks if you had a laptop. SW and HW developers writing code, running scripts, compiling, debugging in multiple windows, why would they need an external LCD monitor to actually see what they're doing??? Penny wise and pound foolish. Be prepared to buy things you'll need to do your job with your own dime.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the goal is to reduce US headcount and increase headcount in those countries where the P/Y rate is a third of what it is in the US. That would be a good financial decision if those individuals had the necessary skills AND if they stuck around to do work and provide continuity. Turnover in those countries is very high because the employees are focused solely on making more money (who can blame them). \r\n\r\nIBM is clearly not the company I went to work for 34 years ago. We used to be proud to be IBMers. Today it is a paycheck. IBM tries to recruit from the best schools and the pay is competitive in the beginning, but by year 4, those hires will be behind their peers in other companies. IBM may have more patents than any other company, but it doesn't play out in how they reward their employees in job opportunities and advancement."}, {"review_title": "IT Helpdesk Analyst", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Jun 2012", "job_title": "Technical Support Engineer in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Genuinely appreciated equal standards accross the board, to explain what I mean.
