During my nearly 10 years at IBM, I was in senior positions in both software engineering and marketing.\r\n\r\nWhile in SW engineering, I felt more like a cog in a machine than a respected professional.  For example, engineers seemed to get moved from project-to-project without much thought about whether their technical background was a match for the new project.    Also, layoffs seemed to be more about being on the wrong project at the wrong time than about how good your engineering skills were.   CAVEAT: IBM is a big place, and I get the impression that it's not like this throughout IBM.  Also, I think the organization I was in has improved in that area since I left.  If you interview at IBM, ask the engineers how long they've been working on their particular project and how many projects/managers they've had in the last 2-3 years. \r\n\r\nWhen I moved to marketing I was given good opportunity to advance and broaden, and I had reasonably good managers.  The biggest issue for me there was the fact that I had so many managers and had to work with so many different executives.  Someone once half-joked, that if you don't like your manager, don't worry about it, you'll have a new one soon.   There were also a lot of reorgs.  All of this made it much  difficult to establish a reputation with upper management.  They simply didn't stay in one place long enough to get to know you. \r\n\r\nAt the executive level, it seemed that executives (particularly the General Managers) normally were hired for about a 2-3 year stint, then moved into another division.

I did time with IBM as a contractor - the kind of employee they hire through another agency so they don't have to give them perks like decent pay, benefits, raises, vacation/personal/sick time, job security, or respect. Maybe if I worked harder on my golf swing I could've had a shot. The contractors were treated like dirt, and I think that's the whole reason we were hired like that - cheap labor to be abused like slaves. We worked just as hard, dare I say much harder than our supposed full fledged IBM employee coworkers but for much less money and no way to move up in the world! But shouldn't we be making so much money, you know, doing overtime? NO - overtime was frowned upon. Our time wasn't valuable enough to justify paying us more for. They could just hire another schlub at some low rate to take over for us when we were done. Sure they might be a complete idiot who might cause irreparable harm to client relations but they're cheap! As for raises, instead of raises we got annual pay CUTS - cuts that we were made to feel guilty about - our letters said we should be grateful that we got to keep our jobs, and that everyone had to sacrifice. Everyone meaning the contractors. Full employees were comfy and cozy with their nice checks and health insurance. Our schedules would change at a moment's notice. Can you work this weekend? Ok, well great, and by the way, because you said yes you're working every weekend from now on. Graveyard shift? Same deal. When IBM lost clients as they have a talent for, the contractors were cut loose without notice or severance. Some time before the Melville office closed a local newspaper ran an article about the fact that the offices were closing.

Some great colleagues but don't expect them to still be there after November 2017 when retention bonuses are paid.", "cons": "This practice is failing. It failed in integrating the Meteorix acquisition by not providing the tools needed to succeed and then replacing the bonus with a small %'age of that amount as salary. The practice appears to be losing at least 1 experienced consultant per DAY and replaced by new consultants with 0 experience. This translates to the worker that stays there continually expected to do more while pay does not increase. \r\n\r\nThis practice is led by SS who was the previous CEO for Meteorix. Meteorix was successful in spite of him because he had smart people around him that he was able to empower to make the practice successful. As part of IBM, he now has to stand in a boardroom and fight for his practice to get a piece of the pie against more experienced/groomed executives in other practices that are more politically savvy and he is failing miserably. His leadership team are all frustrated and handcuffed with no ability to improve the situation. It is astonishing and sad to see how quickly the great Meteorix practice has crumbled and fallen apart as a product of IBM's acquisition. \r\n\r\nThe technology at IBM is lacking. It still uses Lotus Notes (IBM Notes) which is a great tool for administrators but lacking from an end user perspective (compared to Outlook). Other tools necessary for the job are rudimentary and may meet the needs of a large consultancy but does not work well with the Workday practice with a predominantly remote workforce. It has recently introduced Concur, Webex and Outlook but the execution is lacking (Outlook is just a front end replicating Notes) so you always feel like you're getting a knockoff version of what the real tool should do. \r\n\r\nThe pay is not comparable to Workday eco-system standards. Base salary pay seems like it is 10 to 15% under what you would see at other Workday partner firm practices.  Also, there is no bonus for utilization (this may be a \"pro\" for some) so your \"total\" pay will be 10 to 20% less than other Workday partner firms. \r\n\r\nWhile employed, I got more spam at my work email address (from internal IBM) than I do in my gmail box. There is so much junk email coming from executives about things that you will have no interest in and you wonder why the organization is paying executive salaries to a glorified blogger. There is no \"unsubscribe\" option for these. \r\n\r\nThe intranet has a wealth of information but is set up like a flea market. You'll have to dig thru the content that is 10 to 20 years old to find the info you need, and hope that it is current. Everything goes to a call center which seem to be in the Philippines or India. They are generally helpful for simple troubleshooting but they read from a script only so if you have anything out of the ordinary, you will spend an exorbitant amount of time trying to get something resolved. I went from spending 5 to 10% of my time on \"administrative\" tasks while at Meteorix. With IBM, this was closer to 15 to 30% of my time. This is less relevant now since utilization bonuses have been taken away but you will still find yourself working more hours because of the lack of efficiency. \r\n\r\nCommunication from leadership is non-existent. Townhalls are a lecture with no Q&A opportunity and there have been no comments/communications to dispel or confirm rumors that affect the practice (are remote workers required to come back to the office? rumors still exist that retention bonuses will not be paid in Nov 2017). What little communications that I did get were given at the last minute (we missed the cutoff for the salary remix so it will be in 7/31 payroll instead of 7/15). Meteorix was a crystal clear lake with open/consistent/clear communication from leadership. IBM's acquisition stirred up the sand and has made everything cloudy.

I worked with my manager on a project before I was actually on his team (I was under a different manager at the time), he would constantly praise me for my work and tell me I should have a promotion and move up to band 7 (IBM's ranking system for your experience level). When I got moved to his team I reminded him of this, even sending back the emails where he specifically called this out. He dragged out the promotion for roughly 5 months, finally telling me that even though I don't deserve it they are promoting me and giving me a raise. The raise was not exactly what I had been expecting (other band 7's discussed their salary and the raise I received was roughly 20k under what theirs). A very confusing process getting told you deserve a promotion, wait you don't deserve this, here it is...you didn't earn it.\r\n- The bonus system is designed to make you feel like you are not working hard enough. At the beginning of every year you decide how you are going to improve and discuss this with your manager. At the end of the year, even if you hit the goals and went beyond with glowing recommendations from the clients you were graded average and told to improve next year.\r\n- The travel. I worked remote, not sure how to put that in the location...but don't get tricked by that. When I first joined IBM I was told 15% to 30% travel, for 2 years I was only home maybe 5 weeks. I may have been ok with the travel if I was busy working on something that needed to be worked on at the client's workplace, but I literally would be told to sit at a desk and do nothing for some of the clients while IBM argued with the client about the contract.\r\n- Vacation and paternity. I was never approved to take a vacation even with over 100% utilization (which at the time was about 44 hours a week for client work). When my first child was born I was supposed to get 6 weeks paid paternity, I had to kick and scream to get 2 weeks (even though I had just finished a client's project and had nothing else lined up because I thought I would be out for 6 weeks).\r\n- Management and general disorganization. When I first joined IBM it took 6 months before I got a manager (I joined during a reorganization of the company). It was a very confusing time since I worked remote and did not know how to do things like find a client project to work on. When I finally got my first manager he was a developer with a team of people who developed...I was a UX designer. He constantly wanted me to go back to school to learn to develop and would not help me with client projects.\r\n\r\nSummary, not a great experience for me and I was relieved to get out. I am now healthier due to less stress and not eating like crap on the road, I see my daughter every day at 5:30pm, and I took my first vacation in roughly 3 years.

It's a way for IBM to get cheap labour to service clients that require certain linguistic or cultural considerations (i.e. speak English or French, be able to get a security clearance) that other CICs (India, Philippines) don't always meet. It's not a \"core\" IBM, but rather almost like a 'subsidiary' experience.\r\n\r\nTo put it simply, your lack of experience and basic entry requirements translate to cheap grunt work like activities (like execution of testing scripts, manual entry, excel entry, programming etc). This translates to low salaries, and a slow promotional curve.\r\n\r\nFrom a culture and from a growth perspective this makes IBM's CIC a rotating door company as the salary is significantly behind what the 'core' IBM pays (i.e. in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver etc), there is some sense of being second-tier. Don't expect to get to high level bands in the center (i.e. 8 / 9 ~90k / 100k cad ) in your first 6-8 years. Bands 6G start at 40k, and have significant number of steps to promote. The band structure 6G - 6A - 6B - 6 - 7A - 7B - 7 - 8 - 9 takes about 1 year per promotion. Point two, the center is utilization driven and you're expected to meet a 95.7% target (which translates to 44-50+ hours / week) - if you don't meet the target (which is not under your control as the work you're assigned isn't always there) you're going to be passed on for promotion opportunities. Some of these require client approvals too, i.e. you're re-sold to the company at a certain rate (e.g. $40/hr), and if you get a raise (e.g. you become $45/hr) the company you're assigned to do work for can reject that promotion and request a cheaper resource instead (you end up on bench).  You will average about 12% per promotion, to get promoted you must be rated  a rock star / rising talent or an exceptional employee.\r\n\r\nThe complexities behind promotions don't make it worthwhile to stick around for more than 2-3 years, it's simpler and faster for you to get a higher salary by applying to a different company with the experience you have gained instead."}, {"review_title": "Great place to get experience but don't plan on staying long", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Jan 2020", "job_title": "Lead Designer and Brand Development in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can move between business units and job functions easily to get work experience.\r\nTeam members and staff are always there to help.\r\nSupports updating skills, work training, and eduction for career growth.", "cons": "They remove full time staff regularly targeting older employees.\r\nReal career growth depends on who you know.\r\nLarge portion of managers are in roles they don't know how to support."}, {"review_title": "Great for going places", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Mar 2020", "job_title": "Senior Consultant in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Every possible client and the art of the possible with such a massive roster of smart, talented folks.

A significant amount of resources are used each year for each employee for professional and personal development. If you spend a little bit of time finding out what opportunities are there, you will be rewarded with significant opportunities for career growth.\r\n\r\nAs an example, career development is a formal part of your Personal Development Plan. This means that at the beginning of the year you can, and should, find out where you would like to improve either your current professional skills or add new personal or professional skills. This includes things that are not necessarily directly tied to your current career. Now, if you do not go through with most of the training you plan for your self, that counts as a negative in your yearly review. In other words, you have a significant incentive for actually going through with personal and professional development.\r\n\r\nThe second thing I like about IBM, particularly after working for start-ups for 10 years, is that IBM has a significant amount of formal process in place for your day to day work, no matter what position you have. This means that you know where you are at all times in any project, and you know what is missing and from whom whatever is missing needs to come. This visibility is great compared to what the situation is like in most start-ups where your visibility into progress on products and projects often is severely limited.\r\n\r\nI also, of course, like the three weeks of paid vacation I get and the IBM health and pension benefits, though no longer as good as they were back in the day, are still excellent compared to the industry as such.", "cons": "The main negative about working for IBM is tied to one of the positives. Formal process means that you have much better visibility into where you are in the overall delivery situation. Not only that, but since you continuously have to contribute information about your progress, you also get information on the overall progress, so you get a very good view into where you are in the big, and IBM is BIG, machinery. The downside of this is that process, particularly formal process, takes time. Pair this with the fact that IBM is geographically very dispersed, and you will find that you spend a lot more time on conference calls in IBM than in most organizations. This can be an impediment to progress in you \"real\" work.

I do agree with the other posts on your site regarding the Indian workforce of IBM - 90% are unskilled, don't have the requisite knowledge and have been hired to make up the numbers/FTEs for GDF.\r\n\r\nMost of the work is messed-up and the 10% who have the knowledge, spend all their time fixing the crap of others or the mess just grows. Is there any wonder why clients hate IBM and are cancelling contracts by the dozen.\r\n\r\nIts frustration hell in IBM India(especially for anyone who's talented, skilled and hard-working). People who are on bench because they're bloody incapable get transferred to some other department(where they have no clue/skill-set as to what they are doing to ensure they screw that up too).\r\n\r\nManagers are the most idiotic bunch I've come across in my career - they are technically zero, they don't have any managerial soft skills and most specialize in sycophancy(whether it be giving rank idiot subordinates good ratings or cosying up to their superiors for better ratings for themselves).\r\n\r\nDiversity is everything - most of these \"diversity\" candidates join because they know they can \"work from home\"/\"hardly work\" as there is no accountability for what you do. Merit isn't anywhere in the equation. You'll be hard-pressed to find any skill-set among these hires - they're that incompetent - but hired so senior management can plug these numbers to higher-ups.\r\n\r\nMost of the talented(not more than 10% of the workforce) are looking out for opportunities elsewhere and leaving in droves, those who remain have other compulsions - some have businesses/consultancies going on the side and the IBM work culture allows a second income comfortably. Some have family compulsions and need to devote time for personal reasons and hence stick around. The rest 90% won't get jobs outside IBM and are hence like furniture hanging around(and squeezing the lemon dry) until the whole thing collapses around them.\r\n\r\nWhenever anything screws up, each department passes the ball on to the next(as none of them have the skill-set or a clue of what is going on) as none of them have an idea of what is needed to fix the problem. So the mess keeps increasing till the client gets tired of the crap and terminates the account. No accountability for anything, so even the managers who messed up just get moved around and ensure the screw up the next account. Why do even clients think of IBM - confounds me. I wouldn't hire IBM in a million years with the quality of people which are around.\r\n\r\nMost US IBMers are good, capable people BUT the same problem that afflicts IBM India, abounds there too. Sycophancy and \"diversity\" hiring is rampant and hence incapable people are there too BUT the numbers aren't as skewed as India - far lower. From my interactions with US employees, career advancement is based on \"who you know\" rather than \"what you know\". This is essentially an IBM wide problem. Most IBM Managers are unskilled beyond belief and the salary packages which they are at - they wouldn't be hired by anybody outside and hence they have no choice. They too are like afore-mentioned furniture in the organization.\r\n\r\nSadly, IBM can't be fixed. Most managers are incapable and firing thousands of managers would be the last option(prior to that coming about, those who do the work would get fired/quit) and nobody would be left to do the work. Ask any ex-IBMer whether he/she'd join back - bloody unlikely. So where would people who're capable come from - nowhere. IBM should just shut down and call it a day.\r\n\r\nThis is by far, the worst organization I've worked at in terms of professionalism, work ethic, integrity(Yep, the thing which is most harped on, is the one thing which is completely absent)."}, {"review_title": "The trouble was not worth the resume entry", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Nov 2019", "job_title": "SAP Consultant in Baton Rouge, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Generic benefits of working for any big company.

Many people have been at IBM for 30+ years.  They have survived many layoffs.  If you want to keep your job, you need to be better then they are in the eyes of your manager.  Being talented and hard working is not enough.  You need to sell your ideas to managers.  Most managers were talented engineers at one point, but managers are shuffled often, so most manage groups whose work they have a limited understanding of.  If you can't explain to your non-technical relative why you are valuable to IBM, you will struggle to keep your job, no matter how valuable you really are.\r\n\r\nThere is a constant flow of people who join IBM right out of college and are gone within four years.  About half find better jobs because they have IBM on their resume.  The other half change fields entirely, or go back to school.  \r\n\r\nA manager being laid off is unheard of.  Non-managers generally distrust what managers say about layoffs, because managers are invulnerable and so have no empathy.  The managers I had took every opportunity to say that yearly ratings were based on your performance and not compared to your pears.  In other words, everyone under a manager could get a high rating.  This was to fight a persistent rumor that managers can not give high rating to everyone.  I believe the rumors are mostly true:  A manager could give everyone a great rating, but other managers would question that manager's judgment, so in practice no manager does it.\r\n\r\nOne trap to watch out for is moving to a town like Poughkeepsie NY, where IBM is a large chunk of the local economy, when IBM is at a hiring peak.  The housing market moves with IBM's hiring or layoffs.  If you buy a house when IBM is hiring, and are forced to sell it a few years later when IBM fires many people, the loss you will take on the house could easily be greater then a year's salary.  Ouch.\r\n\r\nIBM tends to use technologies that are internal or not the industry standard.  Often the IBM way was invented before the industry standard way, and often the IBM way is (or was) better by a small margin.  Keep in mind that IBM may not be the last place you work before you retire, and make sure that you learn some skills that will allow you to get a job elsewhere.  If you spend ten years at IBM and become an expert in the IBM method of making chips, you may find that you can not pass an interview to get a job making chips somewhere else."}, {"review_title": "IBM India - It's India Business Machines rather then International Bussiness Machines", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Feb 2010", "job_title": "Senior Systems Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It's a company for managers and executive level workers.

In the name of shareholder value -- their only benchmark for policy -- they have reduced education to a set of crummy online classes, all but eliminated salary increases, and slashed staffing levels to the detriment of their clients. Local managers have little control over employee ratings or salary increases: they are dictated by bean counters far removed from the employees. Hence, ratings and raises barely reflect an employee's performance. All travel and discretionary spending has been eliminated. Perks like Christmas Parties or Company Picnics are done. On my project, we had potluck events in which the managers had to pay out of pocket for the meat/BBQ for the staff.\r\n\r\nMorale at IBM is very low, and there is a huge brain drain. In my 10-year stint, most of the long-term IBMers (15+ years and more) jumped ship.

Upper management continues to cut everything while crowing about how wonderfully the company is performing. Almost every employee regards this brainless cheerleading as a joke. The company is either clueless or heedless: take your pick. \r\n\r\nAll work now -- from application development to project management to administration -- is distributed into separate towers that are physically remote, and often offshored to BRIC countries.

Opportunity is limited, and in my sector -- government -- IBM's business model, which operates on the idea of premium pricing for premium services, rings hollow to cash-strapped governments.

IBM then expects us to support and train the kids they hire.  Once the kids have gained some experience and since you're a contractor they terminate you without notice.  IBM is a ruthless employer and is only concerned about the profits for the CEO, board and upper management.  They care less about the people on the frontline building the company by keeping their customers happy and working endless overnight and weekend hours (offshift) that lessens the customer impact and again keeps the customer happy.  A salaried systems administrator works on average 60 hours / week with no consideration from IBM.

Management's \"strategy\" can best be described as: Let's constantly implement broad, sweeping changes with little to no warning, put our employees in impossible situations, brow beat them when they fall short, then lay everyone off 3 months later. Oh, and then wonder why moral is at rock bottom. \r\n2. Culture... there is none. Unless you consider infighting, back stabbing, and a general \"meh\" attitude toward colleagues a culture. \r\n3. Get ready for an earful of dishonesty and broken promises from your managers. Managers are constantly trying to oversell employees on a job, project, move, etc. when the reality is they need someone to fill a garbage job that no one wants. Once you're in the role, they'll do nothing to help you. And every time you go to them with a problem, they'll put it back on you. Really atrocious management all around. \r\n4. Semi-annual changes to comp plans and quotas to put full attainment just out of reach. Did you do well last quarter? Guess what, your quota is going through the roof so save that last commission check because you won't be getting another one any time soon. Did your whole team do well last quarter? Expect the department comp plan to be adjusted... IBM is always looking for ways to pay you less while relying on the complacence of their employees to keep them around. \r\n5. Mediocrity, laziness and bureaucracy abound. I touched on this in #3 but it's really amazing how many people here will not lift a finger to help you, actively oppose outside-the-box thinking, and are obviously here just to collect a paycheck... if it's not in their job description, it's not their problem. At some point you'll realize that attitude begins to drain you of your motivation and work ethic, and you'll either make a choice to fight it or accept a mediocre performance from yourself. Don't expect this to be the company where you do your best work - use IBM to build your resume, put in a couple years, then move on to bigger and better things. As for jumping through hoops, get ready for a lot it; nothing gets done here quickly and without approvals, modifications, and pointless review by a dozen other managers and analysts."}, {"review_title": "Good Company to work but not for long", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 May 2019", "job_title": "Senior Applications Support Analyst in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Job Security and pay due to which one might get super comfy.", "cons": "Working on Legacy systems, due to which working on out dated products and no up-skilling/re-skilling.\r\nFlat hierarchy, very little positions to move upwards, unless someone moves out of that role."}, {"review_title": "Good Company but Growth in Terms of Salary is very less", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "13 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Applications Developer in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Company has good learning opportunities.", "cons": "Salary hike is very less"}], [{"review_title": "DB2 DBA @IBM", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "9 Sept 2019", "job_title": "Tech Lead DB2 Database Administrator in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Open place to learn on new stuffs while working.

One day I read an article on the Internet saying that  \r\ncompetition in the microelectronics industry had intensified and companies should look at \r\nvarious options to remain successful. I showed the article to my manager and asked for his \r\nopinion. His response was \u201cnot to worry and keep up the good work\u201d. Of course I expected more \r\nfrom my manager, but I noticed that him and other first line managers at IBM were so much \r\ninvolved with just managing their direct reports and waiting for a directive from above on what \r\nto do, so they rarely if ever took initiative to propose any anticipatory changes or tuning. \r\nIn March 2002 Sam Palmisano became the CEO of the company. He joined IBM in 1973 as a \r\nsalesman in Baltimore and later moved up the ranks as senior managing director of operations \r\nfor IBM Japan, senior vice president for the personal systems group, the enterprise systems \r\ngroup and IBM global services, and president and chief operating officer. Shortly thereafter, \r\nwhen IBM Microelectronics announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2002, multi-\r\nmillion losses were revealed. Unfortunately, the senior management didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t do much \r\nto anticipate this, so now everyone was waiting what the new CEO would do in this difficult \r\nbusiness situation. At that point of time only reactive changes could be made. Instead of \r\nadaptation, which in my opinion required a lot more skills from Palmisano, he chose re-creation. \r\nWhat was his solution? Massive job cuts. In June of 2002 approximately 1,500 out of 7,000 \r\nemployees were laid off in Burlington and I was one of them. Workers piled their belongings in \r\ncardboard boxes and left the office for good, collecting pay for the next 60 days. Among 1,500 \r\nemployees who were laid off there was a substantial number of new hires who joined the \r\ncompany just a little bit more than a year ago.

Buildings are dingy (half of the lightbulbs are burnt out).  Often have to purchase your own hardware out-of-pocket.\r\n\r\nIBM is committed to being as profitable as possible.  This means replacing their US work force with workers in BRIC countries making 80% less.  They've already reduced their US workers by about half, and have no plans on stopping.  If I were a software developer 35 years or older, I would fully expect to be laid off in the next 2-3 years.  The atmosphere is that the executives view employees (and low-level managers) as nothing more than faceless \"resources\" that can be replaced with cheaper alternatives.  Many important senior level software developers have already left, leaving knowledge gaps all over the place.  \r\n\r\nIBM feels like a company on the decline.  They're pulling no stops to appear as profitable as possible, but mortgaging the company's reputation to do so.  They're staying alive by cannibalizing other companies.  \r\n\r\nEmployee morale is down-right awful.  Management knows this, since I haven't seen an employee satisfaction survey in many years.
