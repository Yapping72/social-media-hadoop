Our new CSP system has created a ton of barriers to even do the job. Folks all over the world are ordering parts for us and are sending them all over the place and then we are on the hook to track them down. If you want pertinent info for the ticket, you have to drill down into several different menus... it\u2019s terrible and has made an already tortured life at IBM that much worse. I wouldn\u2019t tell my worst enemy to come work here it\u2019s so bad. Everyone on my team hates this job with a passion and most retired the moment they could. The ones left can\u2019t keep up anymore and working 30 hours overtime every week is getting old.

Dental is 130 a month for me and 2 kids. We used to get a small bonus every year of a thousand or less (before taxes) and they managed to take that away from us to. Being a technician for IBM is the bottom of the barrel. We are the red headed step children that IBM doesn\u2019t give 2 craps about yet we are the ones who actually see the clients face to face. Guess what, I have nothing good to say about IBM to clients when I\u2019m around them. Sorry for the rant, but I just worked all day Saturday and then had a code upgrade project that ran all night into Sunday and didn\u2019t get home until 6am.
