Honestly this would be a PERFECT example for university students about how management fails in real life. The managers are with the best words atrocious people, those who are actually working are being pushed to the limit resulting in now social life because you are working too much , or as they put it \"you are contributing to the greater of IBM \"... even if you are the few who actually graduate and actually have some financial knowledge left in you, do not bother applying, as here bottom licking and asking the manager in the morning if they want tea or coffee will get you more props in carrier development, than your business tasks, absolutely horrible no respect for your work , basically even if you work for the whole team you are still underachiever...managers are bottom lickers they have not a single drop of management in them except for 2 of them. In their views you are no one and the manager is like a beacon of light sent from the heavens above to guide you through life.."}, {"review_title": "What used to be can be again", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "15 Nov 2017", "job_title": "Manager, Marketing in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Access to the most incredible minds.

Bluemix, Cloud, Mobile, Analytics etc.  But they all lose support in short time.  \r\n\r\nYou'll be harassed by all levels of management, as it flows from the top down.  You'll be assigned to work some new strategic objective such as Watson, but pulled away when bad numbers are publicized.  You'll be forcibly placed into another in-vogue area such as Cloud, but that will fail also within a few years where you'll be moved to yet another hot-item such as Agile development.  \r\n\r\nSometimes you'll be sent to an entirely different department, perhaps over to customer-facing duties where the customer contract is chaotic and usually in legal contention.  There you'll sit for months doing nothing, except filling out billing forms to keep your utilization numbers up.  \r\n\r\nFrom there you'll be pulled from that \"account\" to another (different) customer, where the cycle starts again.  Then you'll likely end up back in Mobile or something, where one will languish for a few years until you're finally RA'd \u2013 that\u2019s FIRED \u2013 not laid off.  Along with 20k others in the US, and 110K world wide.  But wait \u2013 Ginny said there\u2019s 20k job openings.  Whew.  Thought it was gonna be a disaster for a second there.  A quick check of the job openings shows a strange removal of jobs after a one week posting.  You\u2019ll print one out and call the hiring manager.  \r\n\r\nHiring manager asks where you got the requisition as they are pulled every week.  After you explain, he indicates that there\u2019s a global hiring freeze throughout the company, and his department is no exception.  Feeling compassionate, he explains why he has to post them in the first place, then remove them 7 days later.  And he was never going to be allowed to hire for it in any event.  He\u2019s busy and hangs up.\r\n\r\nYou'll miss the usual severance, and receive a month's pay before you're escorted to the doors.  You'll also forego your usual 401k match, because they sneakily changed the year's contribution to once/year on December 15th only - and only if you're still with the company on that date.  \r\n\r\nThen you'll find yourself 57 yrs old trying to find a job with the IBM albatross hanging around your neck.  You'll think back to when you were 30 yrs old, where you were confident and cocky, knowing that nothing like this could EVER happen to you.  You snickered at the old folks, the 55+ crowd, and wondered why in heck IBM didn\u2019t get rid of them so you could get a raise for yourself.  But now at 57, your family and kids will look at you in distain for being unemployed.  You've let them down.\r\n\r\nThen you'll come to the realization of why IBM's legal dept is more than 8% of the company when you try to argue age discrimination.  Or why the latest RA took all of your friends over the age of 53, but mysteriously none of the hot shot kids or young management types.\r\n\r\nYou'll wonder why there's a list of con's of this company that goes on for 20 paragraphs, compared to just 1 for the Pros.  You'll wonder why investors don't see the execs wrecking the place in a hysteria, each taking home $15mil/yr salaries, with $7mil/yr bonuses, and another $45mil/yr in stock options.  You\u2019ll imagine the execs stretched out and sleeping on one of the company\u2019s fleet of 20 large luxury private biz jets on their way to the monthly financial meetings in Europe.  You\u2019ll imagine.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the IRS is after you for some silly 401k malefaction and has put a lien on your house, IBM has sent your name to the credit bureau for a $920.00 trumped up travel voucher you supposedly never paid.  You'll wonder what has happened, or were you just run over by a bus?\r\n\r\nComing home someday you stop by the mailbox and notice a letter from IBM.  It's from Ginny.  She's congratulating you on your \"retirement\", and offers you a choice of 1) Jelly of the month 2) a jumpstart cable box or 3) a magazine subscription.  I\u2019ll wonder if I should just toss it, or if she\u2019s serious.  She is, and it gets tossed.\r\n\r\nAs winter sets in, you'll wonder"}, {"review_title": "Engineering Life at IBM", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 May 2016", "job_title": "Component Engineer in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "With many any IBM's employees being in the mid 50 year old range, there is going to be many opportunities available for management positions in the upcoming years.
