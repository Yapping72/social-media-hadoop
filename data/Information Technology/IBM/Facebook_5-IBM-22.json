Also the attrition is high. But their business model still works for them. Because their business doesn't get affected at all if an employee leaves the org - IBM replaces him with another \"bakra\". For IBM employee in a project just adds up to the headcount that can be billed to the client.

These measures can go up-to pantry and washrooms.\r\n\r\n4) Legacy management in last stint of their careers.

This was exacerbated by the fact that upper management was forcing the departments into Agile, which led to employees used to doing waterfall to simply do waterfall with iterations. Agile was used entirely as an hour tracking tool for the bosses to send angry emails every day based on their pointless charts, which were based on numbers that everyone was making up.\r\n\r\nAs a 20something, being the only one in a sea of long time employees with the next youngest employee being in their 30s is a bit of a shock. The fact that IBM only hires college hires or internal makes for the young ones to want to leave, and the internals to result in an echo chamber where no one advances the team. To have to use a version control system whose last major update was in 1995 is insane and will scare off any new talent to a more modern company (where modern in this case could be someone using CVS...)."}, {"review_title": "Great reputation, average company to work for.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "19 Nov 2013", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Research Triangle Park, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The flexibility is great.

The reason you are outsourced to IBM in the first place is because of cost and the reason IBM removes you from that client is also because of cost not because you are underperforming.  In order to be profitable, IBM can't be keeping and paying the same number of people right?  Because everybody at the top wants to be more  profitable and got his or her year end bonus.  You are encouraged to look for other positions within IBM, personally I haven't known anyone who successfully landed another position for any meaningful length of time, like longer than three months.  Once you are on the bench and don't have a client you are underperforming as you don't generate any income for IBM and your performance appraisal would state just that now it's kind of your fault and a very good reason to get laid off . . . .

I survived the layoffs for almost 20 years, but eventually my luck ran out (despite never receiving a bad rating). I am still with the company as of now, but my last day will be in the next 3 months. I have seen this happen to very talented employees many times during my years at the company. The layoffs are often determined by what project you happen to be working on at the time that the layoffs are done, rather than being determined by your skills or value to the company. \r\n\r\nUp until recently, IBM was very good about giving employees the flexibility to work from home or even to work purely remotely from other cities. Recently it was announced that this policy had ended and all employees were expected to be on site for all working hours. For some employees, there was no local IBM office where they could work. Those employees were told they would have to relocate closer to an IBM office or they would not be able to stay with the company. This was another case where very talented employees were essentially forced out of the company.\r\n\r\nFor the past 10-15 years, it seems like the company tries to reinvent itself and entirely change directions every couple of years. But IBM never sees any of these strategies through. It tries them briefly, and if they do not pay immediate dividends, something new is attempted. On top of this, IBM has had a habit of always being late to the party. Only once cloud computing was well-established by IBM competitors did IBM start trying to get into the market, for example. It is very frustrating as a worker to feel like the company has no real direction or sense of strategy.\r\n\r\nIt also often feels like the executives making the strategy decisions are too far removed from the reality of the business. IBM has many layers of management between the regular employees and the executives that make the decisions.\r\n\r\nFinally, and I imagine this is probably true of many large corporations, IBM treats its employees in a very schizophrenic manner. When a project is behind schedule or high priority, IBM management tells its employees that we are a family, a team, and we all should pull together, work extra hours, go the extra mile, etc, to see the project to completion. However, when IBM decides that they need to cut costs, they'll have one of their frequent layoffs (except they will only refer to them as \"resource actions\", the same way downsizing to them is \"right-sizing\"). And when the layoffs happen IBM management makes it clear that this is a business and these things happen.

No other company in India comes close.\r\n3. Great opportunities for growth - both personal and professional. In IBM you dont necessarily have to go in a linear growth pattern (manager , Sr Manager). It is an open world here. You can experience any job role you want....move forward, backward or sideways.\r\n4. Focus on innovation and \"doing things differently\" in your everyday tasks (You dont need to be a genius or a scientist to innovate)\r\n5. Focus on taking initiative - empowering each individual to take his ideas, his career and growth in his own hands.\r\n6. Trust and respect for employees - My internet access within the company is not curtailed. The time I sign in and sign out are not monitored. I have unlimited casual leaves, and the company trusts that I will not misuse these. IBM also has a great diversity program and I know that I will not be discriminated against in my company. \r\n7.

Also, the band/pay structure makes it highly difficult to earn a decent wage after a long period of time if beginning at entry level.  Raises are low and do not occur often.

in all territories, as customer capex spend on perpetual licences shifts to opex / SaaS & the numbers still need to go up year-on-year to protect the all-important share price - if it\u2019s not happening in-quarter then it may as well not happen at all.\n\n-  Increasingly regular rounds of redundancies interspersed with multiple resignations at all levels, many are choosing to vote with their feet anyway as resources & support necessary to support customers adequately evaporate.\n\n-  Graduate Program struggle to break-through onto proper money & mostly then leave for either Salesforce or Microsoft (who get cheap, pre-trained, enthusiastic second-jobbers off a conveyor belt).\n\n-  Office facilities & day-to-day working environment for staff (away from client-areas) leave
