Great strategy - spend money to hire and train and then let other companies reap the benefits. It seems like the really good people leave unless they become someone's pet and find a political loophole to career advancement. The good ones who stay probably do it for family reasons due to workplace flexibility, or don't want to take a risk... IBM should be one of the most sought after companies to work for, but it's just a place to build a great resume for 2-5 years and move on for anyone with career ambitions. \r\n\r\nI haven't worked outside of Market Insights, but from what I hear, this is supposed to be one of the best places to work. Maybe it is by IBM standards, but not by what you would expect. There are way too many politics. Management doesn't even take the time to get to know employees or take an active part in developing them. It's all passive. The employee has to initiate everything (career talk, mentorship, and even just basic learning about how to do the job). You only interact with the first line managers even though the executives make the decisions. If you get a few minutes with them, they act like God. It's an outdated style in today's world. It sounds nice to say that employees should manage their own careers, but there's way too much workload and secrecy to cut through. Most of my senior colleagues tell me that if you want to advance, it's more about wasting working time to put on shows and kiss executive ass than about the quality of the work. Doesn't sound like a lot of fun when you can just leverage the name for 50-100% higher salary and a better title... The thing is that management could avoid that by just respecting and fairly compensating employees when they have the chance, but that makes too much sense."}, {"review_title": "IBM is not a technology company, it's a sales organization..", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 May 2009", "job_title": "Consultant in B\u00f6rde-Hakel", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "IBM allows individual consultants to create their own individual career paths, and invests heavily in its employees' professional development", "cons": "long hours, no such thing as balance between work and family,  long hours traveling, spending considerable amount of time away from the family, IBM's bureaucracy and reporting process\r\nridiculous salary plans, the increasing job demands and lack of respect the corporation's executive leadership has for its workforce."}, {"review_title": "Great company in a state of change", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Aug 2009", "job_title": "Managing Consultant in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wide range of opportunities and projects, good personal support and good knowledge management.

My review comes from working in the Server group.\r\n\r\nIt is no secret that IBM's \"strategy\" has been to reduce it's US workforce.  They're achieving this by two methods:  small but continuous layoffs spread throughout the company and by making it more unpleasant to work there to encourage attrition. The unpleasantness ranges from big things (most people haven't had a raise in years) to the petty (no coffee, no soap in the kitchens, etc.).  Meanwhile, the senior executives are making millions upon millions  Consequently morale throughout the entire company is extremely poor.\r\n\r\nTraining?  Only if it's free and local (no travel expenses).\r\nRaises?  Small and non-existent.  IBM redefined their salary ranges a few years ago.  We used to \r\n   hear you've got lots of growth left in your salary range.  Now you hear, \"well, you're near the \r\n    mid-point of your range, so you're paid what you should be paid.  It's like jumping halfway to a \r\n    wall - you'll never reach it.\r\nSalaries?  When I worked there, I thought it wasn't bad, but three of us have left my team in the \r\n   past two years and we've each received pay increases at our new companies in excess of 30% \r\n   and that's been in this terrible economy.\r\nWorking Conditions?  Varies widely throughout the company depending on your local mgmt and \r\n    location.  It was generally pretty good where I was in the Pacific NW.\r\nCareer?  At the big sites, there's plenty of places to transfer or try new jobs.  Smaller remote \r\n   sites are more limited.  And there's no way IBM's paying for anybody's relocation.  \r\nPromotions?  Still possible if you're on the right projects or working with the right customers.  Pay \r\n   raises are minimal with a promotion, but at least the halfway point in your salary range is a little \r\n   further away after a promotion.\r\n\r\nIBM's always been beauracratic, but local management always had flexibility to take care of their people.

Their main focus is on short-term financial success without considering the impact on their workforce or the client. They say \"client comes first\" but I have never seen IBM encourage this behaviour internally, what they really mean is \"bring in the money first, then Client comes second\". Financial gain is so important to them that it encouraged to bend accounting rules as much as possible, even if it means a loss in the future - as long as they can get the gain now. \r\nSenior management bark down the phone at people and you're made to feel guilty if you can't attend certain calls (on Saturdays...). \r\nEmployees don't take responsibility for their actions. This is not out of not-wanting to be responsible and own actions, it is out of fear of the repocussions should something go wrong.\r\nThere is absolutely no movement for progression or promotion (on GTS side, anyway). Yes, it's a good starting salary for a Graduate, however by the end of the 2yr Grad scheme you will be earning less than the market value compared to your non-IBM peers - they say they compare your salary to a PMR aka Market Value, yet this PMR hasn't been updated in years and is different for men vs women. \r\nImmediate-management don't have the time to actually support their team in career development, as they have a full-time job to do and being a people manager is just an additional task on the side. \r\nFinally, they're off-shoring everything. They have a 60/20/20 vision aka 60% resource far-shore (India), 20% near-shore (Slovakia/Bratislava) and 20% on-shore (UK). Not only do remote colleagues not have the skills to step-into the shoes of those they are replacing in the UK (and by replacement I mean made-redundant), but the cultures don't support each other. In the UK, employees work long-hours until the job is done. In India, colleagues don't know how to think outside of a process or list of instructions for e.g. if something goes wrong and the way around it isn't on the process list then they will just stop and not do anything, they won't even come back and tell you it's not working. You will be constantly chasing them. In east-Europe, if it's 17.01 they go home. So be prepared to have to work double hard to cater for the slack elsewhere. In addition, the IMI service in India is fairly new, about 3yrs old. This means that the colleague skills are way below-par and still being trained. About 70% of my stress was caused by IMI's inability to complete a job. \r\nIf you want to work for a company that is all about the business and dollar signs, IBM is for you. If you want a great culture, progression and support - find somewhere else.\r\np.s. There's no free tea/coffee - you even have to pay 25p for hot water.

IBM invests in educations to facilitate skill development.\n- Career opportunities\n- Flexible work time", "cons": "- Low salary, low salary increase (if any), very low bonus (if any). Each role has allocated band range. Mostly, it doesn\u2019t really matter how well you do your job, you wont get a proper raise until you meet some criteria and i think its the criteria that the 1st line managers use and play with, to manage your salary expectation. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done this or that in order to get a raise\u201d, \u201cYou have to achieve certain accreditation to speak about salary raise\u201d and even if you do what was asked, there is going to be another condition most likely.\n- Ever increasing expectations: the more work you get done, the more work you will receive. Once you become a reliable person who gets work done, you get rewarded with more work. And quite often, you end up doing the work of others because they are lazy, inadequate, slow or irresponsible. \n- Demotivated employees: thats something that i feel is impacting IBM overall. It feels like 80% of the people are avoiding hard work, or challenging situations. Rarely anybody wants to take ownership of difficult tasks. A good team spirit is rare to find. Everyone wants to just cover his own butt, some are good at kissing up to their managers, playing it safe, and smart, make the KPI\u2019s look good. So much politics. No real work gets done well. There are very few outstanding employees, very few good leaders and managers, but most others are average. There are some employees that i would probably fire if it was up to me. No one feels threatened of being fired, so they do whatever they want and cant care less.\n- Checkpoint: the new performance evaluation session which takes place every 3 months. In that session you have to sell your self and explain what good things you have done and how does it fit in the 5 key dimensions (you just have to do whatever it takes to fit your achievements within the 5 dimensions) and when you are done complimenting yourself, then the bashing starts. Manager tells you of all the things that you need to work on to improve yourself and it\u2019s really shocking how conflicting the evaluation is every session. One time, you are good at something, next time you are not. Probably, it\u2019s a way to make you feel you are not good enough yet so don\u2019t ask for salary raise or even think about it. I think this method is pushing many people out of the company.\n- Lack of motivation: there is little to be motivated about. After some time you realize, you will get nowhere financially, you get more workload assigned, and of course higher position doesnt mean better money, you get the same money and only the potential or promise of getting more money after good job and meeting certain conditions, and that could take months or even a couple years. If your goal is to just advance in your career so that you gain experience so that one day you get a better paid job elsewhere, then that could be a good motivation. I bet you most are thinking that way.\n- Lots of changes its tiring to keep up: company keeps transforming, renaming, shuffling, sunsetting tools, bringing others some of which are mandatory to use, then sunsetting them again, freezes hiring, then unfreezes, cuts costs everywhere possible, restructures, merge positions and responsibilities, dozens of announcements, changes of processes which then get forgotten.

Does not bode well for turnover with younger staff.\r\n- It's a huge company without a core product - If you ask Google, Facebook, or Amazon what they're known for, most will have a consistent answer. Very few people can properly articulate what IBM is known for. (Cloud? Technology? Services? Computers?)\r\n- You'll do a lot of things at IBM that are not transferrable to future opportunities. Design Thinking and Agile are all done the \"IBM Way\" and they'll give you certificates and badges for completing classes on \"IBM Essentials to Blockchain\". Something that feels good in the moment but worthless when you're looking at the market.\r\n- Huge company. Good luck meeting your boss's boss.

The last few months have been a particularly heartbreaking time - 4 rounds of layoffs in the last 6 months, because the share price is much more important than the people who've made this company great for our customers.  Commission statements are delivered via random number generator, where it's nearly impossible to determine if you're getting paid on your accounts, or those of someone else. If you have a commission dispute, IBM outsourced that aspect of the business to South America years ago, and they have little time, or sympathy to help resolve money issues for people whom they feel are paid too much.  Tuition reimbursement is a thing of the past - better to hire from outside than foster organic development.  At conferences when the company hosts a party, they'll let in the customers, but not the IBMers who brought the customers. Sometimes a little awkward.

You will have no incentive to improve your skills or do the best work you can.  Regardless of your accomplishments or contributions to IBM, you will always be looking over your shoulder and waiting for the axe to fall.

Prepare to go multiple years with zero raises and you may just get a 15% salary cut.  Good luck with attempting to order supplies needed to do your job such as a notepad or pens.  Four levels of management approval are required to buy a pen.  IBM upper management is completely detached from how the actual business operates and works.  Upper management management blindly issues directives to cut a certain percentage of headcount in rolling \"resource actions\" (terminations) and other expense with zero insight into how this actually impacts the work being done.  Upper management is essentially in a sealed bubble, isolated from reality and focussed solely on two items: This quarter's earnings & the stock price.  There is absolute blindness beyond the current quarter.  No consideration is given to the future business impact of continuing to destroy employee morale and continuing loss of skills in IBM due to constant job reductions in the US in favor of cheaper \"resources\" in foreign countries (\"Global Resources or GRs\" in IBM speak).

Not outstanding or great but passable.  I certainly imagine elsewhere it could easily be worse but it wouldn't be much of a stretch to be better either.", "cons": "There are many things about being in services that don't work in favor of the employee.  For example, even if you are a salaried-exempt employee, you work under a billable hours model with a utilization target.  Now perhaps I don't understand the meaning of being a salaried-exempt professional but I thought it meant that you are paid to get the job done regardless of the number of hours it takes.  If it takes 80 hours you do it.  If it takes 30 hours you do it.  The model of compensation does not line up with the business model under which IGS gets paid.  Even salaried exempt employees are told they must bill a bare minimum of 44 hours per week but our utilization target percentage numbers are based off of a 40 hour work-week with 2080 total available billable hours per year (52 wks/yr * 40 hrs/wk).  How this is not fishy accounting I don't understand but I'm not an accountant.  In the mean time, this mandatory \"assumed 10% overtime\" as they call it, effectively nullifies out any actual vacation to which you might be entitled as per your employment terms.  All this with a base pay that is essentially losing the race with inflation and cost of living and a bonus pool that never quite seems to be as full as it could have been \"if only.\"  They lure you with promises of potential performance bonuses of 10%-15% of your base salary but in reality, every single year there has always been some reason why even the best performers never receive more than 2%-4% if anything at all.  There's always a reason why there is not enough money even when times were way better than they are now.  It is quite plainly evident that as an employee you get your slice of the pie last with shareholders extracting their pound of flesh first and leaving us to fend for whatever scraps are left over.  I will have been working for IBM for 9 years coming up this May and while I was happy at first, after the first few years I realized my pay and benefits had pretty much plateaued early and since then, I have just been slowly getting poorer by staying.  On absolute terms the pay is not horrible but at this early stage in my working career my earning power should still be significantly increasing, not decreasing.  So, if something does not change significantly for the better this year (not very likely as the economy around the world is in total shambles) I may decide it is time to pick up and move on.  IBM is turning out to be nothing like what I dreamed it would be when I was fresh out of school and eager to take on the world.  These past 9 years at IBM have sapped the enthusiasm and motivation out of me as more and more is asked of me for less and less in return.  I think if I did not live and work in the D.C. metro area my job would probably have been sent to India long ago anyway.

Yeah, you can take an online course about Rational stuff, but you won't have access to any simulation environment or the actual tools!\r\n\r\nYou will come in a professional expert in the latest technology and tools, and in 2-3 years you will have no knowledge of current stuff and won't even know about the latest tools... \r\n\r\nAlso, they spend about 40% more time of various compliance mandatory educational courses that majority of employees don't really understand and are not interested in knowing.... In private, they despise of of \"those non-sense courses\". \r\n\r\nThere will be constant drumbeat about integrity and honesty... They will offer a fairly low billable rate to the client, and then will saddle that client with a 44-hour base week, 20+ part-time support employees (that will cause headaches to PM and overruns to the project), and an over-bloated team of 20 guys for the job that can be done by 10.

It's definitely a very good place for graduates to build up their experience and their CV/Resume. If you like to work in a big corporate and don't mind a bit of politics then go for it. I have seen many people who joined IBM as graduates, stayed there for couple of years then left IBM with a good experience and then after 20 years or so they are back to IBM with a very senior position to end up their career with a safe job and good money.

You can't expect high salary unless you are at a very senior level. If you have an Entrepreneurial mindset then you will not enjoy working in IBM unless you are in a unique project. If you are going to work in the consultancy wing of IBM which is called GBS then good luck with finding a project. If you finish one project then IBM does NOT assign you to another It's you who have to find a new project and go for interviews etc. Almost like looking for a new job. This is where your links can help you, otherwise you have to stay at home (still paid) for sometime till you find a new project. If you do a fantastic job no one would come and tell you that you are promoted. You have to prepare a promotion pack yourself and you have to 'BEG'. If it's your style then you are welcome. Politics play an important role in EVERYTHING in IBM. If you are not that person then don't even come closer to IBM.

That doesn't have a big impact on me, but will be difficult for new managers or new IBMers).\r\n\r\n- I've been able to find good talent for my teams internally in IBM.  I'd say that about 1/3 to 1/2 of the employees on each team I've been in have been extremely dedicated to their work and their customers. \r\n\r\n- The sales org seems to be addressing some of the complacency in their ranks, and I've had very positive experiences with most of the newer sellers they have hired.  It seems there is more pressure now for sellers to take ownership of their accounts *after* (and not just until) their commission comes in.\r\n\r\n- It's pretty easy to move internally if you have a good reputation or good performance ratings.  You may encounter resistance from your management, but they're not allowed to block your movement indefinitely.", "cons": "- No work life balance.  I work at least 10 hours most days plus reply to email all weekend (as is expected by management).  Similarly, you are expected to check/reply to email and take meetings when you take a vacation day. The vacation time expires every year, so it's not like you can even bank the time when you have to work all day on vacation.   I have taken a lunch break less than 30 times total in the past 10 years.  I hear you have to actually book a meeting on your calendar in order to have time to step away to eat, instead of muting yourself on the phone meeting you've taken.\r\n\r\n- Benefits have eroded over the years.  Our health insurance options are still decent but have gotten much more expensive, with higher deductibles and lesser coverage every single year.  This is particularly true for family coverage.  Many of us use our spouse's insurance if they work elsewhere.  Our 401k matching used to be great.  They have cut the matching in half and now only match at the end of the year. This means if they lay you off on Dec 30, you get nothing. (Yes, they did lay people off in December).  Quite a few people who are doing \"good\" but not stellar work have not seen a raise in 5+ years. \r\n\r\n- Constant layoffs. Of course it doesn't hit every business unit or every group every time, but we are always doing \"Resource Actions.\"  As a manager, I have to constantly be prepared to submit names for upcoming RA's.  The RA's are NOT limited to low performers or areas where there has been a work reduction.  I'm supposedly in a growing part of the business, but the job growth is not in the US.  Despite what our CEO tells Trump or the media.\r\n\r\n- I like the new performance review system in theory, but in practice assessments were handled poorly in 2016. We were strong armed into decreasing employee's ratings without any explanation of why or what the expectations were for average or above average ratings.  There is a disconnect as my team is viewed as high performing, but I'm not permitted to give them high performing ratings.  \r\n\r\n- We are just wrapping up our bonus planning, which occurs once a year.  I was able to give 0.5%-1% bonuses to employees who were high performing.  It was the worst \"bucket\" I've ever seen, but not by much.  It's rare to get a bonus of more than a few thousand, no matter how good your results were.  Obviously, it's different for middle & upper management and for sales. \r\n\r\n- The scope of our jobs keeps changing and growing, because they lay off people and add those responsibilities to existing staff.  Currently, I'm doing the work that was spread across three people last year. (I was already pretty busy before this change). My story isn't unique.  There is little or no training when you are forced to assume responsibility for tasks that were previously not part of your job. \r\n\r\n- Lots of favoritism. I say this as someone who is seen as a top performer and a favorite! I've worked in four business units at IBM, and in each, upline management has a very obvious bias towards some employees and against others, which does not align with recent performance.   I also can't believe how much gossiping and in-fighting there is.  I get enough childishness from my children!  Who needs that at work?\r\n\r\n- The \"back to the office\" movement is in full swing, as well as forced relocation.  Yes, getting to work from home at all was a perk, not a right, but it was very transparent, especially in management calls, that this was done to encourage attrition.  Not enough people quit because of this policy, they are now doing layoffs. \r\n\r\n- Constant \"transformation\" churn. Every year, our execs decide they are going to reinvent the wheel when it comes to internal processes.  Every year we waste tens of thousands of man hours pursuing these \"transformation\" projects that never actually result in any significant changes.  I'd welcome transformation if our executives were genuinely interested in it instead of just holding many, many meetings to talk about needing to transform.  \r\n\r\n- \"IBM - I've Been Meeting\" - in management, you will spend the vast majority of time in meetings that could have been replaced with a quick email; meetings to discuss what to do in the other meeting about the same topic that day; etc.  We're terrible at collaborating.  Interestingly, despite so many meetings, most people I know at IBM have difficulty understanding and communicating what their organization's objectives and priorities are, as the information that trickles down from upper management is pretty limited.\r\n\r\n- Mentoring is talked about constantly, and yet maybe 5% of the people I know at IBM have a mentor.   To be fair, most people don't have the time.  Similarly, we used to have a robust talent program where the top 5-10% of employees were groomed for more senior roles.  This was dismantled and the replacement feels very much like \"you're on your own.\""}, {"review_title": "Are you kidding!?

Exposure - We will get the opportunity to work in cross cultural and cross timezone teams which is both interesting and challenging.\r\n7. Other benefits - Year end bonus, quarterly market share, chauffeur reimbursement for higher bands, fuel reimbursement etc.\r\n8. Work timing - 5 workdays/week and mostly 8-9 hours/day.\r\n9. Learning - One of the best employee training online facility.\r\n10. Managers - Few of the managers are exceptional, especially European guys. It will be a great learning opportunity.\r\n11.

For instance I have worked in a project where managers used to make everyone work on all weekends and extended hours upto 11 hours per day, rarely giving them the entitled overtime benefits. Even the year end reviews were biased based on regional politics, and even worst on how long people are spending extra in office after the stipulated time, for which the managers fondly call \"availability\". It was common for people who work smart to get less ratings compared to those sit in office for 12 hours without doing any job. This is more common on Indian managers (very few had this habit) whose aim is to improve billing by making everyone work overtime and weekends even if there isn't any need. So if you are lucky enough to be assigned to such a project, then there will not be anyone to help you out other than looking for a jump.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the hike and market share is decided by the managers themselves and it just requires a formal sign-off by the HR. So basically in India, most of the times, it is based on your language, and non-professional skills.\r\n\r\nIn some project, Work-Life balance goes for a toss. You might end up spending upto 70 hours per week in office.\r\n\r\nOnsite opportunities - Again might depend on how your treat your manager rather than how well you did your work.\r\n\r\nBottomline is that all the policies of such a great and old company is sometimes being misused by few Indian middle management for their personal gains, resulting in the company losing some outstanding talent."}, {"review_title": "Good people.

From what I understand, the air is clearer and better when you fly in the upper echelon.\r\n\r\nTo advance in IBM means to leave the group you are in. In the three organizations I have worked in, I can only think of two instances (out of a total of over 150 people) where people were promoted to manager level from within.

Difficult to move horizontally between business units especially in the more senior positions.   There are a lot of year-end administrative processes to complete.  First line managers are responsible in giving you a yearly assessment score, but often times they do not even work on the same project so they rely on the project assessments that the employee is supposed to complete at minimum every 6 months.  First line managers should make an active effort to talk with the leadership team from the projects you work on, but they just go off of project assessments to determine how you performed for the year.

I bought in and sold a solution to a large health insurance company in Phoenix, assuring them (because this is what I was told) that \"IBM is in the NAS business for the long-haul.\"  Within a very few months IBM dropped this product line and aligned themselves with NetApp.  While not necessarily a bad thing to be aligned with NetApp (and not necessarily a good thing, either), how many companies come out with new products and push them hard for 6 months, then give up, deferring to a superior product from a competitor?\r\n- when I was laid off my manager did not have accurate revenue numbers for me.  He ignored a $400,000 sale then, when I told him about a $1.5 million deal that was going to close the next month, he didn't seem interested in knowing about it.  Why?

The Global Services culture revolves only around meeting a ridiculous utilization target rather than delivering innovative work. The employee utilization target ignores vacation days and company holidays (YES, your earned time off counts against you), so everyone is required to carry additional projects throughout the year to meet their target. Any admin employees are forced to perform (completing the hours of regular mandatory training, attending all hands meetings, navigating the bureaucracy, etc.) won't count toward their utilization target, so employees must add more work time to their 60+ hour work week. Many won't take all their earned vacation because they fear not meeting those targets. There isn't enough bench or bandwidth to address business development, so late nights/weekends are spent crafting responses. Managers aren't given raises when they are promoted or even given a break in their utilization targets. Promotions to management positions are presented simply as \"opportunity\", which meant a 30% increase in work and no additional compensation for my promotion. The real \"opportunity\" is to gain as much experience as possible and move on to a company that respects their employees. Even if employees meet or exceed their utilization target, raises and bonuses are still minimal at best. I was always a top or higher performer (\"1\" or \"2+\" ratings) and typically received only a 1% or 2% annual raise while being told to be \"thankful you have a job\". Many coworkers would significantly exceed utilization targets and still not receive an annual raise. Employees are ranked as \"low performers\" so IBM can justify layoffs. The US staff count continues to be reduced while a large amount of work has moved to (cheaper) inexperienced global resources with inferior skills. There isn't any career path for most employees anymore. The management style is often one of instilling fear of a low performance rating and a layoff. The purse strings were so tight that new employees were instructed to download trial software to perform their jobs because we couldn't get licenses for them. Meanwhile, the approval to purchase a software license was a 10-step process of justifying the purchase to people who either would ignore the request or immediately decline. It takes months to get anything done because of the bureaucracy. Toward the end of Q4, it is common to receive an email encouraging employees to sacrifice vacation or work as many hours as possible. Sometimes, the incentive for those sacrifices would be to enter the employees into a contest to win a DVD player or MP3 player (not making this up). Typically, no incentive was offered at all. Last year, we received an email from the organization lead strongly encouraging everyone to work an additional weekend as \"an opportunity to catch up on your projects\", which was a thinly veiled way of saying \"we need to bill more hours so we can exceed our quarterly projections\".

Now I doubt it's more than 3. You get out of school and do your bit and leave as fast as you can. Or, if you work for one of the many many acquisitions you do your bit and again, head for the doors. Either you will be forced out or you will be so disappointed you'll leave on your own. \r\n\r\nThe 'change' from PBC to this new system is pretty bizarre. They have spoken much about it but people are already supposed to have submitted their interim goals. So word to the wise, make up your goals out only those things you know you can do and put a shine on it. \r\n\r\nAs far as money is concerned don't look for much or for much improvement over time. There is none. Get the best deal starting with them as you can because it's highly likely that will be as much as you ever earn.  \r\n\r\nMovement in the company is nonexistent. Don't even bother. Every silo is so overloaded and pressed to deliver that no one will ever let you move and no one is ever allowed to take on anyone new. Your department would have to be circling the drain from overwork for management to ok even a single new person.  First and second even third line managers who leave the company are not replaced. Which in and of itself isn't terrible since there's an astonishing number of management levels but it does tend to create a lot of churn. \r\n\r\nThey're going to this 'agile' model which is highly highly process and metrics driven. Essentially bringing a Common Core mindset to the company. There is one way to do everything .Period. One form one check box and one process. The process and the paperwork are really the only things that matter. That's your job. So if you're a wiz with paper work, extreme detail and micro management you will thrive here. It's important to understand that that truly is your job. Documenting and data gathering. Not technology. What ever you thought your job was it's really being a clerical assistant slash paralegal. Process process process process. I really can not stress this enough. IBM believes that they can solve all their problems by dumbing eveything down to process and using the data gathered by that process to dumb it down even more. \r\n\r\nOne bright spot is the legal field. IBM probably has more attorneys per capita than the White House. Everything you do will be bounded and gated by an attorney. They for most part get first and last approval over everything. If you're a lawyer this is not a 'con', if you're not you will have to make your own decision whether essentially working for a lawyer is for you. \r\n\r\nWhich raises my last point. Most of the middle and senior people are not technologists or technical people. Few have any knowledge of the technology you work on and have arrived at their jobs by finagling the organization and shining when it comes to process. You will often be confronted with fairly senior people who have no earthly clue what you're talking about and they're not shy to tell you. It's like a badge of honor to say \"I'm not technical'.

Keep in mind, IBM is a massive company with over 400k employees so there will naturally be a mix of those in any big firm.  \r\n\r\nIBM is undergoing a major transformation right now, and it is an awesome time to be an IBMer. From Watson AI to cutting edge digital transformation project partnerships with Apple, IBM is involved with a lot of cool opportunities. I joined straight from undergrad and can confidently say that I have learned immensely as a consultant and even now senior consultant. Overall, I am extremely happy with my decision to start my career as a consultant at IBM. \r\n\r\n- IBM = High Prestige and Brand Name... Great exposure to different industries, especially early on in your career. (been here for almost 3 years and I have worked in Pharmaceuticals, CPG, Electronics and Foods)\r\n\r\n- Incredible support and colleagues, some really smart people work here and the educational resources/training  can be used to further your skills greatly\r\n\r\n- As for work-life balance, it has its ups and down (way more ups for me). I've had a lot of opportunity to work remote, but also times where I'm working through the weekend on 12 hour shifts... (client dependent)\r\n\r\n- High percentage increase in pay when promoting ( got around 38% when I went from consultant to senior)\r\n\r\n- Flexibility in living location (anywhere as long as you have weekly access to an airport)\r\n\r\n- Option to alt travel to another city if it is less than or equal to the cost of flying you back home (huge plus for me)\r\n\r\n- Opportunity to earn status and free miles/points on airline/hotel chain and car rentals (I've funded numerous international trips via points I've earned from client travel-  for me huge plus)", "cons": "- Make it your own culture. Sometimes you have to be a go-getter and network to get the next project. Don't expect to get handed new opportunities, other than your first year in (unless you have a proven track record). \r\n\r\n- Consultants here tend to get lumped into a specialized area. For example, I am in SAP and everyone in my group works in SAP. Once you are identified as a skilled and experienced user, there's a high chance of getting pigeonholed into one specific area of consulting making it hard to change down the line. \r\n\r\n- High travel requirements. In the client's office by Monday, home by Thursday night on normal weeks (work remote Friday). Every once in awhile expect weekend work that can be very long (although periods of remote work make up for this in my opinion)\r\n\r\n- High utilization targets for new/newer inexperienced consultants. Being on the bench is all dependent on what you make of your first opportunities when you start. Sometimes these factors are out of your favor when you start, especially during seasons of minimal client demand. Once you gather the appropriate skills to become client facing, tons of opportunities arise and I have barely been on the bench throughout my 3 years here.\r\n\r\n- Small raises and/or bonuses. However, big pay jump when you promote \r\n\r\n- Less face to face management  (I have never met my IBM manager in person)"}, {"review_title": "Managing Conslutant", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 May 2019", "job_title": "Manging Consultant in Providence, RI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company, considerate helpful management, very ethical business standards, excellent benefits - except no \"company pension As an employee you can be very proud of the many technical advances of IBM such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence, hybrid cloud.", "cons": "Not enough business in my particular fields.

You tend to work on small teams and get to know people in your cadre.  Those people are usually pretty good.  They have also figured out how to recruit from colleges and hire a lot of very bright college grads and still train them.  Most of the time, you are working with good people.  There is also lots of on-line training available.  On your own time, you can learn just about anything you want related to technology.  They have amazing resources available to all employees, if you can find them.\r\nSenior management seems to be embracing actual change toward more modern business practices.

You will more than likely not know and not often interact with your manager. This is no fault of theirs-- they have full time jobs, are most often not on the same project or client as you, and are not based in your city. I have not met any of the (many) managers I've had through re-orgs, and infrequently interacted with them. Managers are not rewarded for working with their managees and not motivated to do so.\r\n\r\nThe culture is fast-paced and demanding.

There is limited flexibility in moving beyond the CIC and I see this as a huge talent drain for IBM. If I ever leave the CIC I probably won't return to IBM ever again.
