Pay 2. Management. 3. Projects \n\n1. The pay at the Baton Rouge CIC is low comparatively and relatively. I personally worked there for ~3 years, and was still earning under $50k annually as a developer. \n\n 2. Management is out of touch with the developers. When things don\u2019t go as planned, management fails to take ownership over developers. Overall, management doesn\u2019t care about developers. They only seem to care about developers charging hours to a project so they meet their numbers. These, among other, managerial issues are deeply rooted in the CIC. I have seen similar issues brought up to upper management, and sadly, little or nothing is done to address the issue's root cause. Instead management\u2019s usual solution is to throw the CIC a pizza party or send you cookies to show you that they \u201ccare\u201d.\n\n3. I worked on 6 different projects while at the CIC, and only 2 of the 6 were quality. One of the \u201cprojects\u201d I was assigned was for RI Dept of Health working as a call center operator scheduling covid tests for kids and teachers.

The teams were assigned project managers, who were great and engaged, but the size of the program meant that it was really hard to get and exposure.\n\nConnecting with higher-level IBMers (or IBMers in other areas of marketing) was also challenging at times because it doesn't occur naturally through the work you do, which means that it often depends on whether or not they have time to meet with you whenever you reach out.\n\n[NOTE: My internship was during a time when everything was still entirely virtual, so it's possible that these cons are a result of that.
