Surprisingly sketchy practices on some core products. A lot of the 10+ yoe engineers here have been at no other company and know little of the outside world or technology progress.\r\n- This company is super frugal - to the point of being just plain cheap. This is a far shot from the reputation it has of having extraordinary perks and a fun environment to work at. Offices are very average for today's standards even compared to much smaller companies. Management dumps corpspeak on Googlers every other week and feels old school corporatey. Open memegen (the company's internal 9gag) any day of the week to see popular posts endlessly complaining about compensation, corpspeak from leadership, lack of transparency and overall self-mocking messages. It's pretty depressing and nothing ever changes.\r\n- Systematic racism + extreme in-your-face diversity consciousness advertising makes this a painfully hypocritical company to work for.\r\n- As an engineer who myself enjoys the guilty pleasure of an occasional praise, being surrounded by Googlers' continuous self praising and elitism is repulsive. Stick around employees a bit after a few drinks and you'll open up a secret world made up of an openly dirty racist bunch of humans lusting for more money and status (or might just be the London office).\r\n- Shady HR and recruitment divisions are with aggressive under the belt tactics for hiring and retention."}, {"review_title": "Posititive", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Switzerland, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good environment, colleagues helpful.
