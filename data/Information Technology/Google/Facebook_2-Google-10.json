One of the luring tactics they'll use to get you to enter gTech is to say moving internally is a real possibility -- except that gTech hires engineers to sales support roles, and other orgs at Google don't give a gTech engineer any credit (because we have nothing to show for our work, which is not technical, not interesting, not relevant). I was naive enough to believe the job description, which sounded actually interesting, just to start in a role that led me to depression and undermined my coding skills, because my main task (when I wasn't in useless meetings) was archiving emails.\r\nDon't do that to yourself. If you want to be a Software Engineer at Google, postpone your application and study for an actual SWE role. Don't join gTech thinking it opens doors, because it actually closed them.\r\n\r\nNow, for those who care about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: Google doesn't. Of course, the image we get is that everything is a shining rainbow of happiness, inclusivity and cooperation, but if you speak up about things that actually matter, they will make you shut up. The louder you are, the bigger the consequences. Google is mostly made of privileged demographics that couldn't care less about any event or initiative about DEI internally. What ends up happening is that the underrepresented people end up getting yet another expectation of DEI champion, and that will only slow down their progress, productivity and, ultimately, compensation and career progression.\r\n\r\nOverall: the food is great, but it's not worth the trouble \ud83d\udc4d"}, {"review_title": "Dream company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation":

Everything is in formulas, and just doing a great job is not enough. You need to shop yourself and shout about your achievements as loud as you can in order to get promoted. Also, the commute from the city sucks. Oh, and the company's product strategy is a laughing stock. Google jumps on every shiny object. It's one thing to reinvent an industry, but to launch clones is just low. Google+ is shoved down everyone's throat. Google Offers was a Groupon clone.

I knew of at least one peer with a Masters who had to start as a level I - $16/hr.

I cant really blame her, knowing now how some companies manage promotions and $$ when It comes down to It, but that was just insulting..for the both of us. not unusual for educators, especially in preschool, but Google sets their own standard high and when a company is always preaching how \"employee first\" they are you kind of get to hold them accountable to it in practice."}, {"review_title": "nohting", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Marketing", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Overall Google is a great company with lots of benefits such as free food, gym, paid internet, cell phone, lots of vacation and free transportation.", "cons": "The organization is very flat with lots of Type A personalities meaning that its pretty cut throat to move up."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Good", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good As it and great to work", "cons": "It has not timing section and havig to be grat"}, {"review_title": "n/a", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Senior Financial Analyst in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great people, benefits, learning, projects", "cons": "busy, difficult to be promoted"}, {"review_title": "Senior", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Money was good morning and", "cons": "Long working hours lot night"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best Work life balance at Google", "cons": "There is nothing as that"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice work, free food, growth", "cons": "nothing that I can think of"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Account Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay and great benefits.", "cons": "None that I can think of."}, {"review_title": "Job Review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Validation Engineer in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits at Google are amazing.
