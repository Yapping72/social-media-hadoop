Depends a lot on the country / office you are in, though. A lot of smart people, computational resources and great (even if proprietary) tools for everything. The company carries the whole burden of your relocation. You have the ability to somewhat easily find a different project when you want and to move to that different team if you have spent 1-1.5 years on your current one. A lot of various projects to choose from.\r\n\r\nIf you are not a white heterosexual male, you get special attention from recruiters, also numerous internal support and career mentoring resources are at your disposal, so the company might be a good choice in that case.", "cons": "Depending on the project and the team you might feel inefficient of even irrelevant due to projects being huge, old and slow. Despite all the talks about fighting biases etc, your future to a high degree depends on your manager, who is often a great engineer, but with the upsetting probability might be useless or even detrimental as a manager. Your future also depends more on your ability to demonstrate your work than to actually do something useful, which makes sense, but the company does not do a nearly good enough job teaching you how to perform such demonstration the way it is expected of you. Sometimes you have to choose between doing something useful for your team or something good for your \"career\". Having to stick to all those internal proprietary tools (that are otherwise great to have) makes it hard for you to do much if you leave the company and those tools behind.\r\n\r\nYou might end up in a team that won't be nearly a good match or might get a wrong role due to the recruiters making mistakes and then neither recruiters nor managers caring about fixing them.\r\n\r\nHRs pretend to be your friends, but make no mistake - they are not. They only seem to care whether you are a potential issue to the company. If an issue might go away as a result of them bullying you - they might do that, as actually figuring out how to fix internal culture is harder than putting pressure on people.\r\n\r\nThe company keeps changing internal performance evaluation requirements, disrupting rythm of work on regular basis probably so someone up high might add \"revamped evaluation process\" etc to own resume at the cost of all the damage to the rest of the company. The CEO, Sundar Pichai, is great at photo ops, but otherwise uninspiring. The company's top management pushes American politics onto the rest of the company even if you are outside of the US. If you do not share radical left-wing American perceptions - either learn to stay silent or start searching for another job.\r\n\r\nIn 2019 there was a big situation where a bunch of black employees and their \"allies\" were harassing a white employee for that employee being unfortunate outside of work to call the police after noticing a black man who acted as a trespasser and who refused to leave. The top management of the company in a company-wide meeting \"addressed\" the situation by pledging their support to the black employees and said nothing at all that would prevent similar harassments in the future."}, {"review_title": "excellent", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "20 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Business Owner in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "everything al the works great", "cons": "none nothing didly squaT NADDER"}, {"review_title": "Data", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Data Scientist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good nice very good excellent", "cons": "Data science data scientist analysis"}, {"review_title": "No work balance", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Limited time in the company", "cons": "No hikes on time for annual"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Manager in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing, Mindblowing, Fantastic, Superb, Awesome", "cons": "None, None, None, None, None"}, {"review_title": "excellent", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Senior Developer in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "excellent place to work in uk", "cons": "hard working and long hours"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Team Lead in Chennai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work experience and good team", "cons": "Hierarchy and many approvals required for everything"}, {"review_title": "Google", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can change teams internally if you want", "cons": "Slow pace, people works for performance review"}, {"review_title": "Good experience in interview", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits wfh relocation hikes work life balance", "cons": "No cons no cons no cons"}], [{"review_title": "Stable and slow", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Customer Solutions Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Offers you a stable and medium-well pay job", "cons": "All works slow, so dont expect big changes"}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Systems Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stable Company, One of the best trainings", "cons": "No hike in salary, no growth as an individual or as an employee"}, {"review_title": "Great Place to Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in New Delhi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay Work Life balance kjdfkdfjdfs", "cons": "There are no cons of working at google"}, {"review_title": "nothing", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pros. is that is a good company", "cons": "Cons. is work pressure and you need to do your tasks right."}, {"review_title": "Loved the place enjoyed", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "30 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Anaheim, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work loved every body", "cons": "not enough money and the were cheap"}, {"review_title": "best company to join", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "lots of perks and stable work life balance", "cons": "you must be skilled enough to pass the interview exam"}, {"review_title": "Not Perfect, But Great Place to Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "28 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunity to do things you love", "cons": "Like most companies, some groups are better than others"}, {"review_title": "great!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "26 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Receptionist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "work-life balance is great.

On a given day, there are options ranging from pasta to fresh sushi rolls, sandwiches, salads, and other kinds of Asian cuisine. There are even cafes at Google that allow employees to get a free coffee pick-me-up from a local third-wave cafe, on campus.\r\nGoogle offers on-site physicians, nurses, medical services, and health care coverage to keep its employees happy and healthy. Googlers can travel without worries; employees are covered with travel insurance and emergency assistance on both personal and work-related vacations.\r\nGoogle offers its employees one of the most innovative work environment cultures. Google cares so much about innovation, that one of its principles encourages Google employees to spend 20% of their time pursuing innovative ideas about which they are passionate. Products and applications, such as Google News, Google Alerts, and Google Maps Street View, have been born from this principle.\r\nGoogle offers shuttle services to employees who work out of its Googleplex so they can avoid long wait times in traffic and even the stress of driving to work. Every morning, big black buses equipped with WiFi pick up employees to get to the office.\r\nGoogle also offers some of the best paid parental leave for new parents. Its employees have paid leave up to 18 weeks if the father is the primary caregiver, or seven weeks otherwise. Mothers are still entitled to 22 weeks of maternity leave. Google cares so much about new parents that it offers parents one-on-one consultations to figure out their scheduling for daycare options, money to spend on baby bonding time, as well as four child care centers on one of its campuses.\r\nGoogle also offers a Global Education Leave program, which enables employees to take a leave of absence to pursue further education. All of this education is covered by Google.\r\nSince Google is one of the most well-known technology companies in the world, it offers employees better job prospects should they decide to leave the Googleplex. It also offers growth within the company, whether it be for middle management or higher-level management opportunities.\r\nWorking at Google provides employees with a sense of contributing to the worldwide population. Google employees positively impact society with the applications and technology on which they are working. These technologies would surely benefit the human race; for example, self-driving cars could enable its passengers to catch up on sleep during their commutes. Its accident rate is uncanny, with just a handful of accidents in the more than 20 million miles driven since January 2020, many of which were determined to be caused by human error.\r\nGoogle only looks for the best and brightest minds, and employees are always exposed to other amazing employees and intelligent thinkers. Being around other intelligent thinkers allows for a creative work environment, collaboration, and disruptive innovation.\r\nTo help with morale, employees are free to bring their pets to work. Some Googlers describe that being able to bring their pets to work keeps their energy levels up, as well as bringing joy to other employees.\r\nAlthough there are highly intelligent employees at Google, there is no rocket science that goes into Google offering one of the best work environments. Google simply treats people with respect and supports its employees' creative and innovative endeavors.", "cons": "The competition is brutal.\r\nLet\u2019s face it: When you work for one of the biggest organisations in the world, your employer can easily afford to select the best \u2013 which makes for a highly competitive environment. When you work alongside some great talent, competition will be pretty much inevitable.\r\n\r\nLearning is self-driven.\r\nThere is an expectation that you will actively continue to educate yourself and expand your knowledge as a Google employee. You are encouraged to commit to self-improvement as well as expanding your skills. Some might see this as an imposition on their time, but it is simply part of life in today\u2019s ever-changing work environment \u2013 especially in technology \u2013 and many businesses have adopted a similar culture.\r\n\r\nLaunches drive advancement.\r\nGoogle is known to promote staff as a result of product launches rather than as a reward for incremental improvements. Of course, in reality, most software developers will be involved in code improvement and bug fixing, yet the incentive scheme is not generally geared towards taking that into account.\r\n\r\nWork-life balance \u2013 not always balanced.\r\nMany modern American companies have developed a contrived culture of lingering at work. Ambitious, new or young talent may end up hanging out at the office outside of work hours, often working or learning. This can develop into peer pressure to spend a lot of time at the office.
