VP-level leadership doesn\u2019t appear to understand the simple fact that processes have a cost, and it boggles the mind. Every new VP introduces more random process without ever worrying about the cost to time and morale, and then erects a wall of program managers and forms to insulate from any criticism or pressure to simplify.\n\nWorse, most VP-mandated process is introduced because the VPs don\u2019t trust middle management to do its job. Criticism and comments are discarded without response, and managers and directors I have spoken to are completely resigned.\n\nThe beatings continue until morale improves."}, {"review_title": "Great company to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Engineering Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Chance to work with young, energetic and smart people", "cons": "working pressure could be high sometimes"}, {"review_title": "-", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Senior Java Developer in Chennai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Good Good Good Good", "cons": "Doesnt have anything to say as negative"}], [{"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Account Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Challenging and interesting\r\nLots of perks \r\nGreat people", "cons": "Work life balance\r\nToo much food"}, {"review_title": "Great Team", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Data Analyst in Sunnyvale, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Great team\n- Great culture\n- Awesome learning opportunity", "cons": "- High workload\n- Ambiguity in projects\n- Difficult to align with teams"}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for", "cons": "Not really a lot of cons here"}, {"review_title": "tech analyst google review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "30 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Tech Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture and work environment", "cons": "Nothing really to note here"}, {"review_title": "Good WLB, Kind Teammates", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-WLB\n-Kind Teammates\n-Decent compensation\n-Lots of scalability", "cons": "Slow promo\nNot as competitive as other top paying companies"}, {"review_title": "Good perks and solid work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fun work with excellent perks.
