You often don't get special recognition for doing your job, and there's no guarantee that you'll end up at a job with Google full time - it's all based on business need. This isn't Google's fault.

The culture has descended into one where employees are pitted against each other by a rating system that forces managers to choose their best team members, no matter what. Got a team of all-stars? Too bad, some of them are still going to get bad reviews. Want everyone on your team to work together for a common goal? Sorry, everyone feels like they need to keep their best ideas protected because it\u2019s survival of the fittest. As a result, I have seen great employees forced out, moral destroyed, and careers ruined as the system chews employees up and spits them out. It has taken me a long time to get to this place, as I forced myself for years to see the Google I once loved and not the Google that now exists.

This was probably the best side hustle I've ever had especially because I already had a job on top of this one. A couple months ago the ENTIRE PAY MODEL CHANGED! I went from making about $600-$800 every pay period to about $350. When you calculate that I realized I wasn't making anymore than around $5 per hour. Completely ridiculous! They also implemented these \"tiers\" which make no sense imo. I was sending clients great suggestions and developing relationships with them and my pay reflected that  yet I was put in one of the lowest tiers, so I completely stopped working. It became a waste of time even if you have nothing to do - it's still a waste of time because if you're not spending 15 min on one client due to all of the tech issues then you're waiting hours at a time for someone to pop in your queue and hopefully you snag them before the other hundreds of stylist waiting do. \r\n\r\nI honestly think they realized how much money they were dishing out to all of us and  couldn't keep up.
