Ques were full and you could make a decent income. As time went on, it's just gotten worse. \r\n\r\nThe final nail in the coffin is their new pay model that now pushes commissions and sale incentives. We are no longer stylists. We are now expected to be online sales people! \r\n\r\nThere is no rhyme or reason to the new pay model. One minute you are in the Platinum tier making good money and the next you are in a lower tier making a fraction of what you were making before. There is no explanation as to why you are promoted or demoted. It's like you are being punished when you move down a tier because you are no longer meeting their expectations and you will now make less money and have no idea when you may move up again. It's cruel. You are messing with peoples income. It's not right. \r\n\r\nI now work harder and longer hours to make less money despite following the laundry list of their new requirements and examples. We have to send the highest standard messages, send at least 35 items per message and stay with in the users profile requirements. It now takes me at least 10 minutes to send 1 message and that's not only because of their new expectations but also because of all the technical issues. We still get a daily \"Bad Request\" pop up message when trying to send messages and it interrupts your flow of work. Also, if the user doesn't put in all of their sizes, it limits results and we have to then manually do it which takes even more time. Not to mention Google Shopping is still not working. You have to manually click on each item to get the \"+\". This all takes more time and becomes so cumbersome. It's ridiculous! You put in so much time and effort for what? To make less $$ now than you did before despite elevating the quality of your work. You feel like a fool. \r\n\r\nAlso, they keep on tooting sales and commissions as a good thing. I have yet to see it! It's hard enough to get someone to buy something and if they do, it has to be at least $30, not returned within 2 weeks and you only get a small percentage of the sale. It comes with all these caveats. They are trying to convince us of all the financial gains but that hasn't been the case. \r\n\r\nLastly, I agree with the review below.

I was honest with the Google recruiters and told them I had an offer on the table. They told me Google would offer me the job b/c my interviews had gone well (I did all of the hangouts, went onsite, etc.). They even asked me what the offer was and assured me that Google would beat it. We discussed exact figures. Things were going great. We communicated multiple times, both on the phone and through email. Each time, they said an offer was coming & repeatedly told me not to sign with anyone, but I'd have to wait a few more days or \"next week\". Eventually, the other company pulled their offer. I informed the recruiters of this and they said they'd have a verbal offer for me in the coming days. By this time, we are about 2 months into the process. I've heard that it can take up to 3 months to get into Google, so I was complying with everything they said. Another week went by. Late on a Friday afternoon, I get a voicemail (not a phone call) from one of the recruiters. She says there is no offer and she cannot tell me why, but I can call her if I have questions. Of course I do, so I call. She will not pick up. I left her a voicemail, asking for her to get back to me. To this day, she is yet to return my call. Here I am, without a Google offer and I burned a bridge with a great company that actually did want me. Definitely not the experience I was expecting from a leader in our industry.
