I found out after I started that some employees had spent years researching the hiring system to game it. My coworkers were all significantly less qualified than my peers at prior jobs. My recruiter did not understand anything on my resume and pointed out that it was very different than all the resumes that she saw from entry level men. She assumed that meant that I was less qualified than them and never considered that I was far more qualified. She kept saying things that were horrifically sexist. She attempted to route me towards a non-technical position even after I had passed the interview and gotten approval from the hiring committee. The hiring processes are set up such that the recruiters determine someone's level and the interviewers and hiring committee cannot fix a mistake no matter how glaring. This results in some employees being underleveled. Most experienced women are underleveled by at least one level, but some are underleveled by multiple levels. Other employees are overleveled. This results in an entirely toxic culture. The underleveled employees are wondering what's wrong with them that their entire careers suddenly evaporated. The overleveled employees are extremely insecure and resort to bullying the underleveled employees (mostly women and people of color) because they know that they're less qualified than the underleveled employees. Even the managers who recognize what's happening are unable to fix the problems because HR is more concerned with covering up the problem. As a result, underleveled employees are being given work far below their competence level (because HR won't allow them to get higher level work) and told that they have to prove themselves again.su"}, {"review_title": "TPM @ Google", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Staff Technical Program Manager in Sunnyvale, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Intelligent, Committed co-workers\r\nReasonable Work/Life Balance", "cons": "Analysis Paralysis\r\nManagers are hit/miss (not unique to Google of course)\r\nHit/miss execution on projects"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good GOOD good good good", "cons": "None, I dont have anything to say."}], [{"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Programmer Analyst in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice to work with them.", "cons": "Stressful at times so it was."}, {"review_title": "good job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Marketing Coordinator", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible schedule, great benefits, career growth", "cons": "limited opportunities, strict with ethics"}, {"review_title": "No", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Information Systems Administrator in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pretty good for me I\u2019d say", "cons": "Not bad overall in my opinion"}, {"review_title": "werew", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice office, good perks, smart coworkers", "cons": "Nothing to add at the moment"}, {"review_title": "Good job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Technical Writer in San Antonio, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "the benefits are really good.", "cons": "the work hours can be long."}, {"review_title": "Great job!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Mechanical Engineer in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing facilities and overall personnel!", "cons": "Work can get stressful most of the time."}, {"review_title": "Great company, great benefits and perks", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Product Manager in Z\u00fcrich", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "International opportunities\r\nFlexible work time\r\nSmart people and fun colleagues\r\nGreat perks", "cons": "Becoming more corporate\r\nOriginal founders out"}, {"review_title": "Generally a great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Mechanical Engineer in Mountain View, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits\r\nSalary\r\nGreat culture\r\nWorking with great people", "cons": "Commuting to MTV from SF"}, {"review_title": "Quality analyst at Google", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Quality Analyst in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everything is good at google.", "cons": "I dont have any cons to mention."}, {"review_title": "Great perks and great people", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Software Engineering Manager in Sunnyvale, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working with smart, thoughtful people.

This attitude also was exhibited toward employees who came to Google via acquisitions.  Google likes to stress the point of working on personal initiatives and projects.  This unknowingly resulted in the duplication of efforts between locations.  If it was discovered that a person in another location was working on a similar project, there was usually a meeting to compare initiatives.  If the projects were similar and your peers had seniority over you, you were forced to stop your work even after having invested months on it.  At other times co-workers actively stole project plans and claimed as their own.  On another occasion, one of my personal projects was \"taken over\" by a manager who thought my project would benefit their current initiative.  I was forced to stop work on my project as it had been transitioned to the manager's team.  That said, many of the people are actually quite wonderful.

Google talks a good talk and employees believe management.  However, over the years employee's expectations have become so high, that when an individual is in a poor job situation, they feel like Google owes them something better.  So you have people who sit in a role/team/dept thinking the situation will get better or that management has a good plan, and they'll be fine once they give it a few months.  In reality, that person is either overqualified for the role or a bad fit, but are too complacent to change.  Many employees can't even fathom leaving Google, so they sit there and hope it works out and will figure it out once the new dream role opens up.

Not sure this is worse than manager centric review structures where one person controls your destiny, but there are definitely room for improvements.\r\n\r\nOther big complaint: this place is starting to really limit risk.

Google is no longer the place for experimentation, that happens in other parts of alphabet.\r\n\r\nBeing in the Apps PA, there is a laundry list of B2B features that all apps are being asked to implement.
