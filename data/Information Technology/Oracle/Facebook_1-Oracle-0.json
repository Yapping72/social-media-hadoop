There were even more that did the same that I had connected with on LinkedIn or that I heard about from other coworkers. I wish that, during interviews/training/onboarding, there was more emphasis put on the necessity to network with Project Managers, Delivery Leads, etc, and office politics in general in order to get put on projects to maintain utilization performance levels and the importance of utilization. Without connections to PMs, you are very unlikely to get put on projects and get the experience that PMs and DLs are looking for in staffing larger projects for career growth; so, you have to job-hunt within the job to maintain performance levels and ensure you're in a position to get promoted. I also wish there was more transparency regarding the process of completing a horizontal shift into a role in another department instead of the emphasis that they put on vertical shifts in the same role or department. They also appear to be making moves to bring their employees back to the office, specifically in Sales roles.
