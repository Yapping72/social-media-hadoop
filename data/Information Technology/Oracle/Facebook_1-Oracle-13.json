Leader) will be getting paid less than a IIT fresher(App Engineer).\r\n- There is no hike cycle literally so employees just keep guessing all the time and even managers have no idea about anything.\r\n- No hikes after promotion\r\n- Hikes in general are also low (<10%) that too once in 2 years if you are lucky.\r\n- No Bonus\r\n- No stock for atleast 5 years and the situation can be
