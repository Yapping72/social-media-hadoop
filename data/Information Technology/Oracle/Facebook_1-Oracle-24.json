This team works like a bania shop. It was a 30 members team until two year back which is now reduced to 15. Oracle is about to layoff 15,000 people in India. I am afraid they might close down this team too as management does not see value in the work team is delivering.\r\n- No professional development or training\r\n- None of the policy is employee friendly\r\n- No annual appraisal or performance review as there is no increment since past 7 years\r\n- Recently they drastically decreased their variable salary (which is 20% of the total package) by 90% without any prior notice or discussion\r\n- When you approach management to discuss this issue they show you the door and say that it\u2019s an efficient market and you are free to look out for the better opportunity\r\n- There is no HR policy/Connect: you only meet HR once i.e. at the time of induction\r\n- If you still want to join this profile then start searching for a better opportunity as soon as you join the company and take everything they promise in writing because they will go back on their commitment that they make at the time of salary negotiation.\r\nA guide for salary negotiation: When I joined the company they used to offer packages around 10 lakhs but now they have significantly increased that.  There is no cap on % of hike that you can get over your current CTC (people have even negotiated even 100% hike) as they include 20% of the CTC as variable pay  and you only get 10% of this, as company is not performing well. They negotiate hard and even make false promises but if you negotiate well you can pull off a very good salary package. Below is the guide as per designation offered: \r\nSenior Associate: 15-16 lakhs + CAB + internet reimbursement upto 1500\r\nConsultant: 20-22 Lakhs +CAB + internet reimbursement upto 1500\r\nSenior Consultant: 25-27 Lakhs + CAB + internet reimbursement upto 1500\r\nJoin at your own risk!"}, {"review_title": "Review is for OFSS (Oracle Financial Services Software)", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The only pro this place has is You get to say you work for Oracle.

Not sure about product team\n-Zero Hike, 2 years no hike at all after people start to leave they decide to give some hike in June ( usual it January). That to so little which felt like a joke.\n- Only 40-50 of your veritable will be paid even after working for 9-10   hours everyday.\n- Now about the project BNPP, If you are going to join that project, let me tell you run as fast you can .. and if you are joining as Tester your personal life will be ruined. Mangers will call you you anytime and ask you to work. And always threat you about KPI(which doesn't matter at the end, cause they are not going to give any hike)\n-Mangment don't have sense of personal space. They just can do anything to get the work done ( that too pathetic work)\n- Even though you find any other project BNPP will never release you untill you put down papers. They will always cry about budget.\n- No team activity, no team lunch.
