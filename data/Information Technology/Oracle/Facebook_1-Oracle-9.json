Shame on you Oracle.", "cons": "Firstly, let me say \u2013 The HR folks at Oracle have no control of their duties and the VP (My manager) considers himself above all company policies, compliance acts, rules, and regulations. The HR folks are mere puppets who tolerate the whims and fancies of the VP. HR keeps a blind eye as they have no control at all. The VP intervenes in tasks that do not concern his duties and HR allows the VP to do whatever the VP wants. (The VP referred here is my manager) \r\n\r\nCorona Virus pandemic hit us unexpectedly and my wife delivered our first baby when the virus was spreading rapidly. So, we were even more cautious and didn\u2019t step out of the house unless and until it was an emergency ensuring the safety of our newborn child, avoided all travel, and didn\u2019t allow anyone to enter our house in Bangalore. \r\n\r\nI accepted another job offer during the pandemic and I put down my papers by informing my manager who sits at a VP level as mentioned earlier. After I put down my papers, I was told by my manager to coordinate with Mr. X to do the company asset (Laptop and accessories) handover formalities on my last day. I did the same and the company asset handover was finalized with Mr. X to be done at the nearest Oracle premises near my house. I was happy that I had confirmed and finalized the asset submission at the Oracle office which was close to my residence considering the coronavirus situation that was creating havoc in Bangalore and is still creating havoc.\r\n\r\nOn my second last day at Oracle, my manager informs me that I must submit the company assets to the Oracle office which is very far from my residence, and the reason he states is that he prefers to have all assets in one place. This is even after I had confirmed the asset submission to the Oracle office that was close to my residence and even after I had requested to allow me to submit the company assets to the Oracle office close to my residence due to the corona situation in Bangalore. See the sadist behavior of my manager \u2013 He first informs me when I put down my papers to coordinate with X and do the asset handover formalities and on the second last day he intervenes and says to submit to the Oracle office that is far from my residence. The HR folks were just mere spectators, but they didn\u2019t even bother to intervene. \r\n\r\nEvery company across the globe is putting its best foot forward to ensure the safety of its employees as its core priority. But Oracle ensured that I am harassed and tortured mentally during the pandemic time. I wonder how such companies and managers can put someone\u2019s life at a risk. Not only that, but my manager also wanted me to go out and exchange my laptop charger with another team member and wanted me to submit my team member's broken charger on my last working day to Oracle. I refused to exchange as I wanted to avoid meeting anyone during the pandemic and, I didn\u2019t want to do any fraudulent activity by submitting a broken company asset back to the company. \r\n\r\nI was mentally harassed and tortured by this incident and I raised the harassment complaint to the top officials including the CEO. I hope the reality of the Corona Virus situation sinks into them and hopefully they realize how difficult it is to face such harassment from sadist managers and incompetent HR folks. \r\n\r\nThe HR person who contacted me didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to apologize for what happened and was arrogant when talking to me on such a serious sensitive issue. Instead of focusing on the harassment issue that I raised, they were interested in knowing whether I have a \u201cPROBLEM\u201d with my manager. See how sad their mentality is and how they are handling the harassment issue that I raised. \r\n\r\nI am glad that I resigned from this toxic company which put me and my family at a health risk during this corona virus pandemic.
