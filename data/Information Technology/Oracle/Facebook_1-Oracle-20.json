After the training program, I was placed in the ASR position which was a great because it allowed me to skip spending time in a business development role, which most other companies require. That being said, half of the people who went through training with me were demoted to a business development role after accepting their offers being specifically told they would be put into a closing role. What\u2019s more, they were demoted not because of any indication of skill or dedication, but because of where their last name was in the alphabet. \r\nThe benefits of going through the Class Of program and spending any amount of time at Oracle is simply that it makes you a desirable candidate for other companies. Job security is also very good, but that is more of a benefit for someone with a family to support. It doesn't seem to be a winning benefit for the new hires who are just starting their careers and are more focused on career development than paying for the college funds of children they probably won't have for another 10 years.", "cons": "The downsides of working at Oracle are many, and their extremely high turnover rates reflect this. While upper level management seems to be aware that they have a serious problem maintaining a stable workforce, their inability to react quickly or effectively has resulted in little improvement to combat this issue. These issues may differ across departments, but I can speak to the problems of Oracle Direct, their inside sales organization. \r\n-Career development is extremely limited and structured, with the expectation that those in OD will either go into OD management or the Field. There are requirements on how long you need to stay in a specific role, regardless of achievement or potential, and they are longer for Class Ofs. Additionally, raises associated with promotions are severely limited, particularly if you joined Oracle through the Class Of program (most promotions are capped at $3000 for Class Ofs, and Class Ofs will be paid significantly less than their coworkers who came from outside the company no matter what role they move into). Limits on salary potential ultimately make staying at Oracle detrimental to your long term earnings, and will set you back compared to your colleagues who leave the company. If Oracle thinks the experience employees gain at the company is beneficial and important, the company needs to start paying loyal employees in a way that reflects the value of that experience.  \r\n-OD Management is not an appealing next step for most employees, as it pays poorly and is more administrative than an opportunity to manage or motivate. It seems like those who continue to rise through the ranks of OD management are there not due to their ability, but because there was no one else. All the capable and talented managers I met took the position to bide their time until a specific Field position opened up or to leverage it to move into a management role at another company. \r\n-Uneven territory distribution further contributes to this problem, as reps with more field reps and better territories will do well regardless of effort or talent. This leads to reps getting promoted to management positions, even though they have never actually ran deal. It also heavily favors reps with heavy install territories- those who are mostly versed in up-sell and additional license opportunities, but who have little to no experience or understanding of how to work and compete in a net new territory. Oracle needs to promote more reps who might not have the strongest numbers, but have more experience actually running their own deals and working in a net new territory. Current management has little credibility and does a poor job motivating reps in the territories where Oracle stands to grow its business the most. \r\n-Ongoing training in OD is sparse and often not very helpful. There is a heavy emphasis on sales skills and methods (which all seem to revolve around cold calling, even as it proves to be ineffective and everyone else in the industry is moving away from it), while failing to provide adequate product training. I brought this up to management on multiple occasions, and received this exact response at least 3 times, \"You don't need to know how the product works to sell it.\" This may have been true when OD was just meant to be up-selling modules and additional licenses into Oracle's install bases. It is not effective now that the company is moving into new market segments with their Cloud solution and is facing serious competition from other vendors. Reps should be able to have a real conversation about the benefits of Oracle's solution, as they lose credibility when they can only have high-level, 'fluff' conversation with prospects. \r\n-Finally, company culture is dismal. There is persistent frustration among employees stemming from the feeling that they are not valued by their employer. There is a serious lack of team building and management consistently uses a 'one size fits all' approach to handling their employees. Real dialogue about the issues that are causing Oracle's high turnover rate are rare if they happen at all."}, {"review_title": "Not that good", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Aug 2016", "job_title": "Senior Consultant in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexibility\r\nWorking from home\r\nEasy life, not much hassle\r\nGood to have on your CV\r\nGood if you plan to retire soon", "cons": "Low salary compared to the market\r\nNo salary raises or very low ones\r\nHard to get a promotion, no real career opportunity, too political\r\nNot good for internal transfers\r\nBad management - don't really care about employees and have a self-service attitude\r\nNot suited for young, energetic people (if you want a dynamic, open-minded environment where you get a good paycheck, Oracle is not the best option)"}, {"review_title": "Sales Executive", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Dec 2017", "job_title": "Senior Account Executive in Ciudad de Mexico", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is an important Company in the industry with the credentials to let you get good depth in your assigned territory accounts.

So the company car deal is the best I ever heard (this is what the car dealer told me as well), private pension package in top of the mandatory state pension, home office (with the payment for basic needs like Internet and phone) and the possibility to use shared offices when you need, fidelity bonus after 1 year (very small... but the idea is nice)...\r\n\r\nTrainings and knowledge sharing are exceptional. In the first 3 months after joining Oracle I took trainings with the market value of 25.000 Euro. Now, you can imagine that you will not learn the ABC in Oracle University, if you have no idea about your area (or if you are a freshman), but my case was only to get familiar with the applications as I already had senior knowledge about the CRM/ERP architecture in general. The KT depends of team communication and of manager, but if you have both then you have a very good DWH of knowledge that you have access at. Additionally I got a MBA sponsorship from Oracle.\r\n\r\nTeam and direct manager again exceptional, either if I am not so happy with the next levels of management. However if you have a good direct manager that act as a buffer between the team and the rest I think that you will not feel it so bad. I mention again that this is my lucky case that I got such a good team and manager, because I have a friend with same position like me in French team and she left Oracle especially because she was very unhappy with her work environment and with her manager which was a nightmare.\r\n\r\nRespect and appreciation: very high purely from \"respect\" point of view, but financially you should never expect anything (see the CONS)", "cons": "CONS:\r\n\r\nFirst of all the balance personal life/work is 0 (because 0 divided by anything is 0 :).

However the weekends and 4 weeks of vacation were mine (I never worked 1 weekend in 4 years). This can be OK if you don't have a family, but if you have one and you don't want to divorce, sooner or later you will end up by searching something else. I can mention that the 75% of my colleagues are singles (without a serious very long-term relationship).\r\n\r\nNever expect a promotion or a salary growth. If however you succeed to be promoted after years your manager will explain you how appreciated you are in the company, but that the situation is bad (either if the shares are going up on market) and that the promotion will not be noticeable in salary. But this is what it's happening in other big companies as well, so the new strategy I see is: stay 3-5 years with a company, then get a \"promotion\" in other company for 3-4 years and then come back again to Oracle to be \"promoted\" to a job that you would not reach inside in 20 years.\r\n\r\nNever expect a financial recognition for your exceptional work.\r\n\r\nBetter get used that you don't get the end of year bonus (if this is related somehow with the performances of the company and not a commission of your work... so I don't speak here about a sales bonus for example).

This can be seen by amount of people we have had leave the organization just within 2019 alone. \r\n\r\nOracle as a whole seems to invest alot of their money into certain sectors of the company, such as sales; but at my center, which hosts Business Ops, Deal Management, and Finance for both NAMER and LAD, what I and others notice is that work is monotonous, pay is stagnant, and the ever-so cherished FOCAL is far and very few in between. Very few people receive FOCAL and this is at the sheer discretion of management and upper management (make of that what you will) - it is expected on an annual basis but after two years of being here at Oracle I have only witnessed it come and go once, so it is rare as I stated.\r\n\r\nExpect to have a very slow start. Oracle notoriously pays below market average if you research certain job roles which can be found at my center. Furthermore, like most major companies they hire based on \"market inflation\" meaning regardless of your prior experience, your wave could all have a starting salary of 45K and then the next wave could have a starting salary of 50K despite having no comparable or comparable experience to you, and despite both of you completing the same amount of work, or perhaps you completing more work due to your being at Oracle longer. Oracle does not do anything to leverage the starting salaries of comparable employees hired at different waves due to \"market inflation\". This tidbit of info is the most discouraging aspect of being an Oracle employee; you may find yourself working just as hard or twice as hard as other coworkers while experiencing less pay than them, across the board. As I said, many major corporations do this. I am not excusing Oracle, but I am pointing out that is a huge issue with most major corporations, and a disservice to the employees they say they are attempting to maintain.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to apply to another organization, the standard is to have completed 12 months at a role before moving within Oracle. However HR plays the wonderful game of subjectivity by adding a sidebar to that clause which states, \"however, this is at the discretion of each manager\". Laughable. This means that even though I had completed 12 months at my Contracts Specialist role, it was possible for my manager and her senior manager to choose to hold me back from entering a different team with no real concrete reasoning behind the hold. Unfair. Holds employees back. Demoralizing and demotivating.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, mine and my colleague's experiences with hiring managers and recruiters has been bleak. I want to have hope and say there are excellent recruiters out there, however our experience was that recruiters rarely reached back out to us, albeit taking the steps per Oracle's tools to find a recruitment mentor. More often, we had to do the leg work of reaching out to hiring managers and recruiters to little or no avail only to find out last minute after no communication on their end that \"there is a hiring freeze\" or \"this job has been moved to Q2\" - things that should be of importance for an employee to know. Unprofessional and, again, highly demotivating.\r\n\r\nIf you are a young employee looking to start a career, I recommend going into Oracle with a plan in mind, and a full understanding of the injustices that can entail."}, {"review_title": "Great Experience and Great Money", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "23 Apr 2020", "job_title": "Applications Sales Manager in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Sales Compensation Plans\r\nExcellent Training\r\nSkilled Management and Employees\r\nStrong Brand\r\nTons of Resources\r\nLots of opportunities to move around Oracle. \r\nGreat to have Oracle on your resume", "cons": "Internal systems are a big challenge.

I counted 35 different systems and 'resources' you will use throughout the process (and each system works on different browsers):  \r\n\r\n1. There is no CRM in use and we have to work off spreadsheets that we develop ourselves.  When you start, you get a spreadsheet with a company name and city - that's it. Don't let them tell you there is a CRM - there is something there but it has to be 10 years old and extremely clunky.  No one uses it because they can't get the correct reps on the account.\r\n\r\n2. You will be told to work accounts and once you sell them, you may or may not get paid - chances are slim and you have to get numerous approvals. You will only get paid if you are listed on the account and I can't seem to get on any of mine.\r\n\r\n3. If you do get paid on a deal, it will take up to 3 months after it bills to get paid.  They are in no rush whatsoever.\r\n\r\n4. Training is a joke.  You will get out of training and will have to rely on your manager or you will drown.  If you have a bad manager (extremely common), you will not survive.  Oh, and it is completely self service and you will have to save about 100 links in your favorites.  But, the links will change constantly.\r\n\r\n5. You will have to type the same information on numerous spreadsheets, over and over and over.  And, you are responsible for manually submitting territory changes (with info you have to dig up in multiple places) as many as 8-9 times in a 9 month period.  Each process takes almost a full week for most people.  You will spend 6 months figuring out which accounts are really yours because they will be listed to multiple people. And, you will need to spend $100 a month on upgraded Linked In so you can start making a contact list in an excel spreadsheet.  Good luck finding email addresses.\r\n\r\n6. All travel has to be approved before you book it - even a hotel room.  They will not let you stay at the hotel you want to - cheapest, period. \r\n\r\n7. New hires get the worst accounts possible until someone leaves.  \r\n\r\n8.  There are 40 people calling into the same account and no one is sharing any of this info.  and, they have no interest in helping you - makes sense, there is no incentive to work together.\r\n\r\n9.  Your 'customers' hate dealing with Oracle and will not meet with you.  They will constantly complain that they are getting 5-10 calls a day from Oracle reps.  They will ask to be put on a do not call list and this is an agonizing process.\r\n\r\n10. Reps will tell the customer that they are the one point of contact, so only they can sell their product.  \r\n\r\n11. There is no marketing info you can use except white papers.  There is a marketing team and their only job is to put on events.  You might get a list for some of the events and you might have an account on there, but you won't get the contact info to follow up with them.\r\n\r\n12. When you do get into an account and are ready to propose pricing, all deals require and executive summary that you have to write to get anything approved - this will take you 8-40+ hours.  Let's not even get into negotiating contracts with the customer's lawyers.  Oracle's will not call them - you have to negotiate this, with zero training or help.\r\n\r\n13.  You will be told that you have an inside sales rep assigned to you to sell small deals and set appointments.  There is an inside sales rep, but I have no idea what they do.  I have not seen a sale or appointment yet.  But, I have to spend an hour with them each week discussing the territory.\r\n\r\n14. Oh, the expense system - hope you saved your fax machine.  It is right out of the 80s.  You have to send in receipts for everything over $25 - don't lose a receipt for something on your card or all hell breaks loose.\r\n\r\n15.  Your computer will lock up constantly and Oracle's internal sites will only work on occasion.  You will typically have to try a site 2-3 times and catch it when it happens to be up.\r\n\r\n16. You will do these Quarterly business reviews - Everyone talks about the same deals and just blow smoke.  Very few people are selling anything or are over plan.  The older folks are making their number off of add ons or renewals.  They think it is strange to prospect and you do not have the tools to do so.  Most people are living off of their install base calling in or sending an RFI.  With all the processes and systems you have to deal with, there is very little time to prospect anyway - 90% administrative and 10% selling for sure.\r\n\r\nThis is only the beginning..."}, {"review_title": "Flexibility in working hours", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Mar 2014", "job_title": "Software Developer II in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Good flexible working hours and work from home facility.\r\n-Can utilize one's free time in learning something.\r\n-Great range of products one can work if one wants by switching internally.", "cons": "-Work is of avg. standard.

Oracle is a very big place, and your experience will very much depend on your direct line manager and their manager. Luckily enough my direct manager is excellent, and his manager (responsible for Europe) is also a superstar. There's a lot of passion for what we do, the developers are great (and really helpful if you need a bit of custom work doing to prep for a demonstration). Investment is being ploughed into the product and further acquisitions are being integrated at a massive rate of knots. A huge amount of training is available to you, including cross-product training if you can charm your manager into agreeing it! \r\n\r\nWork/life balance - I work from home or on site most of the time but I speak to my manager nearly every day by phone. I go into the office about once a week, and feel just as welcomed as the desk jockeys! The restaurant is great - food is delicious, but it's not particularly cheap. Lots of people bring lunch in anyway so it's up to you. \r\n\r\nTeamwork: Oracle is very big on teamwork. And that generally means working with people who you may have only just met (or not even met yet via phone/web), often on big deals, and often internationally. I'm regularly amazed and grateful for how helpful people are. Recently a colleague needed help on a very short notice, high-value deal. Our whole team dropped everything else and for 48 hours we all worked on it. So, a real sense of teamwork. It is absolutely vital to build your own personal network of friends and allies across different areas of the business as it makes finding your way around/getting extra resources loads easier. \r\n\r\nCareer opportunities: Honestly, it's too soon for me to tell, really as I haven't had my first appraisal yet. But I will say there are stacks of training courses for all sorts of things (not just products but business skills etc) so on that basis I'm going to say pretty good so far. \r\n\r\nBenefits: Super flexible. You are allocated a certain number of points, and you can basically spend the points on whatever is best for you. Extra holidays (up to 43 days!), health insurance, dental cover, childcare, critical illness insurance, a fancy car, there are lots of options. Pension scheme is generous. Reasonably good car leasing scheme - or you can just go and purchase your own car and any unspent benefit points are paid out as cash instead so it sort of functions as a car allowance.  \r\nAlso, Oracle pays for a concierge service, lots and lots of corporate discounts for all sorts of goods/services, and you can drop your dry cleaning off in any of the main buildings in Reading and a company will clean and return it. Not free, but very reasonably priced. If I was office based I'd probably use it. \r\n\r\nTransport: Free bus service running between Thames Valley Park and Reading town centre which is very handy, especially for the train station. Loads of car parking at the main Oracle campus. \r\n\r\nExpenses: If you submit a claim on Monday (assuming your manager approves it quickly) you could well have the cash in your bank account by Thursday. This is the fastest of any company I've ever worked for, and I appreciate it a lot - working in the field for Oracle means running up a substantial expense bill, and they pay each claim individually rather than making you wait for it to appear in payroll, so you can claim every week if you want. Very cool.", "cons": "It's a very, very big company. It's mainly up to you to find your own niche, and the self service automated admin, HR and IT processes can really grind you down. It's my single big moan - got a problem with your payroll calculation, the team is in Dublin/Romania etc. Onboarding is painful because of this (although of course you have great colleagues to help you out), there is sooo much admin to get done at first. Once you're through this stage though, it just becomes one of those things you have to deal with occasionally. \r\n\r\nHeavy responsibility - you need to be self-driven here. Oracle trusts you to get on and be awesome, which is great because they don't breathe down your neck, but on the other hand it can be a bit daunting. However the culture here is that you just ask for help if you need it, and people will absolutely get involved and add their strength to yours. Oracle often has big teams on deals which could be up to 10 or more people across different areas of the organisation and internationally, regularly a deal team is 4-6 people. You just have to get over it - mostly the people here *are* awesome and they don't let geographical and/or business division separation stand in the way too much. You will spend a lot of your life on conference calls, unfortunately. If you speak any extra languages I imagine that could win you a LOT of friends :)\r\n\r\nCommunication - there is so much of it in the form of corporate emails, newsletters, Town Hall meetings, 'event days' etc., that eventually you begin to tune it out, which is a shame. But there's a point where you learn what you can and can't ignore, mostly. Apparently we even have a TV studio lurking somewhere on the premises but I have no idea where or what it's for...! \r\n\r\nOverall, though, these are not massive issues. They're probably not avoidable in such a large organisation, and are very much surmountable. \r\n\r\nIf you like to operate as a lone wolf, if you like tons of flexibility and don't like adhering to a job description, you probably won't enjoy it here. People are very much cogs in the machine, but quite honestly it's a lot of fun being a cog in this machine."}, {"review_title": "Good Comp, Decent Advancement Opportunity, Intense At Times", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "21 May 2013", "job_title": "Practice Manager in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Comp plan for consultants is strong and medical plan options are good.

Am I winning for Oracle shareholders or is it simply a matter of personal vanity? I'll admit to it. Mea culpa. An awful lot of it is personal vanity.\"  \r\n>Lots of fire drills driven by a top exec or middle management. \r\nLots of Self-Serve Process to get anything done and sometimes these feel like a black hole of no return.\r\n>Because of automated processes, sometimes things take longer to get done that needed. \r\n>It takes around 3-4 yrs to figure your way around.

Depending on your product group, bonuses are typically non-existent, but Larry still needs another island or toy and the senior execs all seem to get their $$MM bonuses so the disparity in pay is ever-present and annoying. \r\n>There is a huge bureaucracy to getting some stuff done.

Yes, you heard that right, 0.0% Hike in the last 4-5 years. \r\n\r\nThere are people sitting in the pre-sales team (One Horizon center, Gurgaon location) who have not received any appraisal since the last 5-6 years and are sitting on the same package at which they joined Oracle, which is a joke of sorts since new joinees, who have far less experience, get higher packages than these experienced professionals (who are mostly married women). There is only dry-promotion (promotion without any salary increase), which also will be done randomly in 2-3 years, which is also done at management's discretion (so you might become a Director someday with the package of an analyst). Worth mentioning here is that this is not he fault of the Managers, but is the fault of the top management sitting in the HQ at US. But what the fault of the managers is that even when they know that people are not getting any hikes & are actually working for charity, they don't help in making your life easier while at work. They would keep nagging about leaves & would see you with utter shock every time you would ask for 'work-from-home', as if you have asked for their part of the bonus.\r\n\r\nI don't what is the motivation for any sane person to stay in an environment like this, but one explanation is that around 12-14 out the total team of 24 people are married women (some with babies), who prefer work-life balance over professional & monetary growth, but because of that, the management sitting in the US is now used to not giving any appraisals to people working in this team, but getting more & more work done. So if you are someone who wants to grow professionally, then my advice is to not join this team, & even if you want to join, then think of staying here for 1-2 years only, as after that period, if will get hard to explain to the next company that why you did not get any appraisal for last 2 years (and also you package will get be below your peers).\r\n\r\nWhen you do not get any hike, there is no motivation to work for such a company & you are only working for the heck of it. Loyalty towards such a company is zero & I would have never-ever joined had I know that there is no hike. When you will ask this in the interview, you would either get a white-lie response that yes there are hikes, or if you are lucky, you will get an indirect & hazy reply.\r\n\r\nIn short: Not at all an employee centrist company since Oracle does not care about the professional growth of its employees and is just focused on increasing its earnings only. \r\n\r\nPS: People in the team consider me really lucky that I was able to get out of the firm in 2-years as they are stuck there now because the the difference in their work-ex & pay-package (very serious issue). Someone with 10-years of work-ex is getting only 8-10lpa, so even if they get a call from some other company, it gets very hard for them to justify this dis-balance and the other company cannot hire them by giving a 200% hike, so they reject them."}, {"review_title": "Storage is Dead", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "20 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Principal in Santa Clara, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Was great that I was picked up and acquired twice.

You need to stick with the people who care, and avoid the people who try to get you to do their work for them, then you will enjoy it.\r\n\r\nYour manager can only do so much for you. Oracle has extremely rigid rules. e.g.\r\n- You can't receive a raise for the same job title\r\n- You can only be promoted or switch positions after an exact amount of time (i.e. 1 year) from a previous transition\r\n- If you go above and beyond, your manager can only give you a few % points above 100% for your bonus, and they have to take it from the rest of the team\r\n- Promotions are done in bulk, you can't be promoted one-off from the rest of a group.\r\n\r\nThey have set raises for internal promotions.

The managers are nice even if they feel incompetent. Working with people your age is very nice in the COE", "cons": "The company doesn't know what to do with out-of-college grads, which unfortunately they are hiring for the new \"Center of Excellence\" model workplace. From what I saw, there is little to no focus on personal development or growth, rather an emphasis on work-life balance. This model works well for older employees who have family's to go home to, but not for college grads who hope to build skills and move on. After two years of working here, I learned few broadly applicable skills. College grads be warned.\r\n\r\nTraining when I started was simply PowerPoint after Powerpoint. After this, they expect you to do months of \"self study.\" This loose method of training doesn't work well for everyone. Many people complained, since Oracle is a company that owns Oracle University, but refuses to use its own resources on its own employees. I found that a theme my entire two years here; Oracle will not train you, help you, or move you, despite its gargantuan size and ample resources. If you work for the COE, do not listen to your managers who tell you that \"after a time\" you can move here or there, to this department or this city, because  while your manager might be sincere, they don't actually have any power to make that happen for you. Oracle is very limited in this way, despite its size.\r\n\r\nThere is little change in this role. I performed the same duties 4 months in as i did 2 years in. Thus, I saw no salary increase or formal title change. Suddenly you look up, two years have passed, and while your peers at other companies have moved up a ladder, you sit on the same job title, the same duties, the same pay, and the same day to day tasks as you had 4 months into the job. I asked repeatedly for greater responsibility but with a company this big, there is little room for creativity in your role. \r\n\r\nUnless....of course.... you are a \"manager favorite.\" As in every company. \r\n\r\nOne pro which I mentioned is work life balance. You will be pleased to know that few people actually work 40 hours here. This is great at first; you can go home and watch all the tv you want. You might even consider getting a pet. And then a few months in you realize that this gets pretty old. Because the reason you can leave is that no one will notice. The work is not important enough to keep you at work. You will rarely work overtime...because overtime isn't often allowed because they *dont want to pay you for it.* Managers simply cannot show on paper that your extra hours added any benefit to whatever project you were working on. \"Let the real consultants do the work.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking once more of personal development and growth- recently the COE came up with a growth model. Unfortunately, It took a year and a half for executives to even take the time to make a career path for the COE employees. And while it's touted and celebrated by the managers, its just corporate nonsense. From my experience, it's actually just a tool for managers to use to tell you while exactly you have not been promoted yet. For instance- \"manager, why have I not been promoted? I seem to remember a promise.\" \"Well, if you look at the 10 career boxes here, you have strengths in every area except this one- you simply have not given enough presentations!\" There is no metric used to measure your progress other than your managers own eyes, and honestly they might not be watching you. I know at least three people that in two years never got a raise or promotion. These are people that Managers swear they want to keep, they might even be the best in their product area. But they didn't jump through the right hoop at the right time. \r\n\r\nThe different product areas are NOT the same. If you want attention at this company and decent training, you need to be either on the tools team or in procurement. The other areas have very very weak training materials. You will be expected to learn a product directly from a person who barely knows it, using materials created by people who didn't know it.

Also, some people get bonuses, while others aren't even aware that people sitting across the floor received bonuses while they're left with nothing. \r\n\r\nOffice culture at the Bala Cynwyd location - specifically, on the development team - is a little strange. For instance, when HAVE TO collaborate with people, you find that they are friendly enough and they know their one area of specialty quite well, but the next day, the same people will put their heads down and scurry by you in the hallway, not even greeting you.  The general impression I get is that people are desperate to get their work done with ridiculous haste so that they can RUN out of the place as early as possible. People voluntarily come in at the crack of dawn, and by 4:30, the place is a ghost town. Maybe only 20% of the employees are still there at 5:15, which sounds great, until you learn that office norms mean you'll raise eyebrows if you come in later than 7:30 a.m.\r\n\r\nA few other things:\r\n-There seems to be a boys' club at the top of the Bala org., and it is abundantly clear who's favored. \r\n-Sometimes, when you reach out for help from another team, said team will be completely unresponsive, leaving you on your own to solve a problem that requires their input. \r\n-Other Oracle locations/BUs allow for flexible work arrangements, meaning people can work from home for part of the week. For some reason, development management seems to think that people can't possibly collaborate if they're not in the office, so working from home is used on an as-needed basis here.

Oh, and the sales tools are god-awful and communication within the account team isn't great for the team and is irritating for customers.\r\n\r\nSuccess in sales orgs is variable and largely depends on how well you can network, your territory, product pillar (database is king, everything else is secondary), and how well you or your sales manager gets along with your outside sales team. Happiness on your team largely depends on how your manager treats you. You will meet managers (mostly), sales reps, and sales consultants with ego who obsessively micromanage and treat their peers with disrespect. Sales consultants can sometimes go unappreciated, and hard work in the sales consulting org is not rewarded appropriately.\r\n\r\nThe initial pay is decent, but don't expect a salary bump as you get promoted. There was also a lack of transparency regarding the bonus structure for Sales Consultants that were part of the Class Of program. The proposed total compensation is not close to what you will make, as every SC new to an organization is put on a bonus ramp-up plan.

Rumor is that a 10% raise is VERY good. % increase is not dependent on your performance.\r\n* Manager will ignore employees concerns when they are being verbally harassed at work because there is no written proof. Even in situations where your colleague tells you not to each lunch on certain days and prevents you from doing so, HR and management will not do anything unless you can prove this (if you have proof go to HR first because managers don't care).

If you don't, the hiring manager will take advantage of the situation. When I verbally agreed to interview for a completely different role within the organization and did not apply via Taleo, the hiring manager changed the \"internal transfer\" to a \"promotion\". My guess is that this was to save money. Promotion will allow the manager to use the focal budget. I had 4 interviews in total: hiring manager and 3 people under him. Then, I was verbally told that the was the best candidate and and to verbally agree to the new role (not knowing the new salary or start date) in order to move forward. Then for the next 1-2months, the hiring manager and his team tried to pressure me into doing my current job and start taking over the new role simultaneously (during this time, the new salary was not disclosed and this was a different/higher role). Then after approximately 2months, the hiring manager tells me that my \"promotion\" will be submitted (during the approximately 2months of being pressured and forced to work two jobs, the hiring manager had not officially started paper work to transition me into the new role). I asked about the new salary  which he assured would come with a raise. Hiring manager tells me the new salary (under market value). I negotiate 2k more. He pulls back the offer saying that he can't work with someone who \"demands\" market value (asking for 2k more still put me under market value). He also said to me, \"Look, I came from nothing.\" Don't know why the hiring manager's background and upbringing has anything to do with my salary, but it does at Oracle. When I asked for the reason for taking away my offer after the salary negotiation, the hiring manager said I had no humility. So I went from being the unanimously voted best candidate for the job to a person with no humility after one salary conversation. This hiring manager refused to give me the new salary in writing during the 2 months but according to Oracle HR there is no such thing as a verbal offer. If the hiring manager doesn't start the paperwork for your internal transfer/promotion, it's best that you start looking for an external role.   \r\n* HR will not speak with you unless they think that the events you occurred might open themselves up for possible lawsuits or if things are clearly against the policies in the employee handbook.  \r\n* Management will pressure you into agreeing to the annual appraisal scores they gave you even if you do not agree. You can have multiple conversations, but your manager will email you asking you to accept the appraisal score until you accept it. \r\n* Oracle has and will promote about the education expense reimbursement but this also depends on your relationship with the manager. Management decides whether the course/training is relevant to work at their discretion.

At this stage , the entire frustated team went to director for complaining. The director listened everything but he didnt take any action. He just informed all our names to the manager because they are all a family. From that day, new torture started, taking everyone to room and scaring them that they will get fired because they complained. He used to scare everyone that he can fire whom ever he wants.

Oracle is constantly taking money away from employees by cheapening the commission plan (but of course raising your quota), taking away PTO in favor of \"Unlimited Vacation\" (yea, right, unlimited vacation - that's code for when you leave we don't have to pay you ANY vacation time), they took away the car allowance, they stopped paying for your Internet connection (even though I and every other teammate worked in a home office), etc. Oracle continues to figure out ways to take things away from employees.\r\n\r\nI have been hired by Oracle four different times in my career, so I was around in the \"old days\" as well as modern day. In the earlier days, as an Oracle field Employee, Oracle did things to make you feel like you were a part of the company and took a real interest in career development. In the current day, Oracle has basically gotten to a model of every sales rep is on their own. There are a lot of intangibles by bringing field employees together for quarterly meetings, annual meetings, etc. They have all gone away. Now, you have to get on the internet (that you're paying for out of your pocket) and sit in front of a screen for hours on end \"training\" on products."}, {"review_title": "Oracle SCC - excellent concept, with random results in execution", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Feb 2018", "job_title": "SCC Sales Consultant in M\u00e1laga", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Context: Malaga SCC pre-sales has been set up as a cost cutting organisation and a talent pool for the field pre-sales teams of Western Europe.

You are encouraged to call at the top, but so is everyone else.  If you end up building the deal, as you're supposed to, you then have to work with many other pillar Oracle reps, all of whom are vying for the same dollars you are.  Many of the other reps I've seen are un-ethical and will not share real information in the interest of growing their deal while diminishing yours. \r\n-Internal systems are a disaster.  Reps use a homegrown CRM system called Fusion that is a huge joke.  So much so that my group uses that as well as another internal portal to track deals. \r\n-Software reps are also required to sell Oracle's Engineered Systems (HW & SW).  You now have a HW \"Gate\" that you must hit in order to even qualify for accelerators.  So, you could sell 100+% of your quota but not hit accelerators if the Engineered Systems Gate isn't met. \r\n-Between quarter end and engineered systems gates, it makes software reps do unnatural things such as deep discounting at end of quarters, trying to cram engineered systems in where they don't fit. \r\n-Too many cooks in the kitchen, and rumor is, more reps are to be hired.  Mark Hurd keeps throwing reps at the marketplace and encouraging the sales teams to fight over company budget dollars like sharks in a tank. \r\n-Culture of Fear.  Everyone I know at Oracle, from managers on down, are constantly covering their behinds as they are afraid of getting canned.  Fear is the management tactic. \r\n-Organization is HUGE.  Finding correct people to help on deals is daunting.  Plus, because everyone is covering their backside all the time, they don't want to volunteer to help on a deal until it's 90% complete.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, I would not recommend Oracle as a sales rep.

Long Sales Cycles - I've sold to companies of all sizes but this by far has to be the longest sales cycle for two reasons. First, for customers to make huge IT investments and change the status quo, it takes time to move through this. No quick decisions by any means. Second, Oracle's internal processes are so ridiculous that its been Oracle's own fault why we can't get contracts out to customers. Then the end of the quarter comes and its a mad scramble so management doesn't look bad but we look like idiots & nasty sales people to the customer. \r\n\r\n2. Convoluted and Outdated Processes - Oracle loves to brag about all the companies we've acquired. I believe the number is upwards of 100 in the past 10 years. We have one co-CEO practically dedicated to just acquisitions! With that said, just to integrate 100 companies into Oracle with no real strategy other than to exploit their customer base, is just a mess. Its really a travesty that Oracle's internal systems, the ones we sell everyday to customers, are not used to improve ourselves. To get anything done quickly is a joke. Quick by Oracle standards is getting a contract for a customer who is ready to buy now in a about 2-4 weeks. I'm amazed Oracle has lasted 40 years but we don't have a proper CRM that can tell us which of the 60 Oracle Reps contacted the Director of IT last in an account.\r\n\r\n3. One of Many - If you can't work well with people or like to act like a lone wolf, you will die here. Not a quick death either, a slow, drawn out death because you die on the vine from not making money till you resign. Most ASRs are paired up with a Field Rep (ASM) or in my case multiple people like an ASM, Key Account Director (KAD) and Global Advisor (GA). Since Oracle Direct is a revolving door, most ASMs, KADs and GAs pay very little attention to ASRs and kinda see them as a nuisance. Because Oracle is reliant on so many teams, groups, partners, if you can't get along with these people, life at Oracle will be hard and frustrating. If you resign, someone else naive as you were when you started will pick up where you left off. You're just another cog in the machine. No surprise but I didn't think it would be so noticeable this soon.\r\n\r\n4. Class Of Program - To further this vicious cycle of Oracle Direct being a revolving door, Oracle is relying on the \"Class Of\" program to build its workforce, recruiting freshly graduated college grads to work in Oracle Direct. One of my colleagues was in the first ever recruiting class and of the 500 or so that started in 2013, about 6 are still with Oracle in 2015. Some of the class ofs get lucky, like one of my 22 year old colleagues. They were lucky enough to run some deals in Q2 and made 1000+% of their number and was honored as our team's MVP while being acknowledged at many different management levels. Way to go colleague! Did I mention they never even spoke to a customer and I get to hear them tell other people on the sales floor that they're the #1 sales rep on our team?"}, {"review_title": "Business Development Representative", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A lot of smart and helpful people that want to see you succeed, good pay, great benefits, good working hours and flexibility.

Good people to work with.", "cons": "Extremely inflexible organization that expects the sales team to produce without giving them the tools needed to be competitive in the marketplace.  Oracle operates this business unit much like their typical IT sales organizations which is way more rigid than industry standard for telecommunications network equipment.  \r\n\r\nThe support for the products is poor requiring the sales consultants to provide an additional level of support in order to maintain customer satisfaction to the level where customers are still willing to conduct new business with Oracle.  \r\n\r\nThe sales process is arduous requiring ridiculous processes for approvals before you are even able to produce a formal quote!  We often had problems negotiating the sales process even when customers were ready and willing to give us a PO.  One time we received a PO in early December and couldn't close the internal processes before the end of calendar year which caused the customer's budget to be lost.\r\n\r\nIn an industry where much business is done by equipment evaluations, getting loaner equipment to a customer is extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nIn an industry moving to NFV, you would think that Oracle would have a great strength.  Unfortunately the support rate for software only and virtual sales is 22% which pretty much kills any large deal once it comes to light.  Despite the sales force continually complaining about this, all attempts to change this policy have been shot down.\r\n\r\nAll of these issues have been highlighted for several years and despite management insisting that things were going to get better, very little change to improve the known issues has happened.  The talented individuals who work in the CGBU are very much disgruntled and I would expect much more attrition.\r\n\r\nManagement can be very petty when leaving to pursue other opportunities.  I left to go to a startup in a different technology field that does not compete with Oracle.  I provided my notice and worked very hard over my last two weeks to ensure that all of the projects I was involved with were handed off and that as much of the customer knowledge I had as possible was given to those who would take over for me.  I had worked fully to the end of the quarter before providing notice with a sales rep who was over quota but management decided not to pay out my quarterly incentive bonus.\r\n\r\nSpecific to my position as Sales Consultant, it was clear that the new management team wants to change the way this position functions to be less hands on with the technology and more of someone who only presents slide decks at customer meetings.  This was not the type of position that I wanted to hold.\r\n\r\nWhile the pay was very good, I never once received any raise in my time with Oracle.  If you are considering a position within the CGBU, ensure that you negotiate a salary that you will be happy with for several years.  The overtime is great, but they do have a budget pool for this that often depletes late into the fiscal year and you will be asked not to work any overtime without prior approvals.  Lately, also, Oracle has been closing the offices for the time between Christmas and New Year's and forcing employees to use their vacation on these days.  Not only is this obnoxious as an employee, but when you are trying to close a sale before the customer's budget disappears (as noted above) and the right people are not in the office to complete the order it impacts you in multiple ways."}, {"review_title": "Really Need to Think Twice Before Joining", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Presales Consultant in Reston, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Did Presales SC work at Oracle for four years.

It's the luck of the draw.  The huge mistake I made was still accepting the job after Oracle did, in several ways, the old \"bait & switch\" on me.  First, I was told I'd be reporting to someone else, whom I never even interviewed with, several days after accepting the job.  At that point, I had no alternative but to move forward and hope for the best.  I was also told it was a hybrid position (50% travel), which only held true during the 1st quarter of my tenure.  A month after being assigned to a conference room with a group of other new hires who were also wondering whether they made the right decision to join Oracle,  I finally was assigned to a cubicle.  Not long after, we all received our territory/account assignments.  At the time, we were told that half of each sales team  were assigned \"Greenfield\" (Net New) accounts and the other Oracle \"Install/Dormant accounts\".  We soon found out this was yet another lie of what would become an endless succession of lies.  You see,  in the majority of cases Oracle cleverly assigned the younger sales people (under 40) not only the \"Greenfield\" accounts, but they were also given \"Install & Dormant\" accounts. Oracle Mgt tried to keep this a secret from the older  sales people who, in most cases, were assigned just \"Install & Dormant\" accounts, only to find out later that most of their accounts only wanted to do business via an Oracle Partner, or worse, were no longer using Oracle at all. It soon became evident that Oracle was setting up the younger employees to succeed.  I could go on for pages sharing the unethical practices I witnessed, and sometimes was at the receiving end of, in my almost 2 years with Oracle Core Technology, but I'll simply sum it up this way....Unless you're willing to drink the Oracle Kool-Aid by screwing over not only your customers, but your fellow employees as well, you'll not last long.  Before I conclude I have to mention the other unknowing victims at Oracle. I'm referring to the younger employees that have been given every chance to succeed that are being trained, if at all, by Managers who have limited sales experience, under 5 years, and are only interested in how & when they can get their next promotion.  These younger employees are being given a false sense of their sales skills/abilities.  They won't realize their short comings until they leave Oracle and land at another company that will have high expectations them."}, {"review_title": "Oracle Textura - Terrible Leadership", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Deerfield, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This review is for Oracle's Construction & Engineering Business Unit (f.k.a.

So here I will try to summarize the characteristics that are most common in all of them. Hope this be useful.\r\n+ From my experience, this is one of the best software development companies to which you can work for in Mexico. If you studied Computer Science and if you entered to the right team, this is where you will really enhance your abilities. Especially if you are a new grad.\r\n+ Good benefits. I would say really above average: \r\n> Adjustable minor/major health insurance [You can decide to include more or fewer benefits depending on the credits you have, like a dental/vision plan].\r\n> Free food, coffee, and snacks if you arrive early at the office.\r\n> Good offices and equipment. Some floors even have pool/mini-soccer tables.\r\n> Good amount of vacation and illness days.\r\n> Sometimes there are special events and trips for team building, like pizza day or donuts day.\r\n+ As a global company, it has international standards, so you will gain good exposure to the best practices in software development. You will gain experience in QA processes, as you will have to write a lot of test cases for your own code, and many senior developers will review your code, from which you can learn a lot.\r\n+ Home office option. However, this will depend totally on your manager and your team. I have met folks who are allowed to permanently work from home, and on the other side peers who are obligated to be in the office always during working hours.  \r\n+ Time flexibility. In general, you are allowed to take time to perform your personal/daily activities when required, and arrive late or leave early when needed. Ex. When you need to pick up your children from school, or when you have a medical appointment.\r\nOf course, this is under the assumption that you will have to respond when there is urgent work that needs to be taken care of, like when some urgent bug arrives or when there is an urgent deadline, even if it is 3 am. \r\nSo more than a defined work schedule from 9 to 6, instead you need to include and mix your daily activities with your work. It\u2019s a flexible schema, but maybe not good for everyone.\r\n+ I would say that the work environment within the members of the teams is a big plus. Almost everyone is very cooperative, and it feels like if you were working with your friends from college.", "cons": "-A big amount of developers and managers are based in India. This means that as a CT time developer, more than often you will find yourself waiting at midnight to have a meeting, or waiting to talk to someone who needs to approve/review you something. This sometimes gives you the feeling that you\u2019re always working. \r\nAlso, this sometimes creates a slow communication, as sometimes you need to wait a full day to get the response for a simple question.\r\nHowever, on the positive side, if your team has an on-call rotation, this comes in handy as urgent issues can be worked at night, without the need that you don\u2019t sleep.\r\n\r\n- Very few teams in Mexico are the ones actually building new stuff, as most of the core development is done in USA and India. Chances are that you will probably maintain and enhance legacy code for most of your time.\r\n\r\n-Experience and pressure vary a lot from team to team. There is no standard. I know guys who work 14 hours per day, including weekends, and on the contrary, there are other teams who barely have work.\r\n-Expect no documentation or training. However, this is not particular to this firm.\r\nYou should expect to be dropped right away on hot and priority issues without any mentoring or previous training, which tends to be very stressful.\r\n-Salary raises and promotions are hard to obtain. There is not a politic about obligatory annual increases. The bar is very high and you need a very great visibility to get a promotion, which is often difficult if you work in a team that develops internal tools. Positions that impact customers are the most likely ones to help you to get a promotion, but they will also be the stressful ones.\r\n\r\n- It\u2019s difficult to change from the development path to the Manager path. Usually, the only way you could get promoted to a Manager position is that your previous Manager leaves the firm and you be chosen to be the replacement.\r\n \r\nIn summary:\r\nThis is a very great company to start your career or if you want a very stable environment with good benefits and flexible schedules, where you can learn a lot if you want to.\r\nIt\u2019s not so good if you expect to increase your salary income within a few years or change to the Manager path."}, {"review_title": "UX heading in the wrong direction", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "27 Aug 2018", "job_title": "User Experience Designer in Redwood Shores, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "In general, the people you will work with in development and PM are nice.", "cons": "The new UX leadership has a visual design background and have put all their focus on a bespoke font and a design system.

Coming from an Oracle 'competitor' in the enterprise software space, I was shocked at just how poor coding standards, code review practices and development at Oracle was overall. You get to work on marquee products which solve challenging technological problems, but it feels like stuff is held together with duct tape. Features are released without real QA, QA teams are understaffed and under skilled (the 'automation' QA teams write would be laughed at in other companies), and customer deployments act as default QA. Middle managers play the blame game quite well, getting enough of the blame shifted elsewhere.\r\n- Compensation increases are poor. Hikes/bonuses are low or non-existent, so negotiating well while joining is a good strategy. India is seen as a 'low-cost' development centre, and cost cutting in terms of budgets is visible quite often. The contrast to competitors for both business and engineers (Microsoft, NetApp, VMWare) wrt these things is glaring. \r\n- Decision making including approvals for exceptional expenses (e.g. new devices for mobile testing) can take months, if not a year or more since everything goes up to at least a VP in the US.\r\n- I did not attempt to change teams in my time there, but was also heavily advised against it, with at least one veteran saying \"It's career suicide\"."}, {"review_title": "Software Developer", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice facilities.

I worked for a company that was humming along quite nicely until it was bought out. Within a year of the merger completion, well over half of the key employees who helped shape the company or were rock stars within the company had quit to form their own companies or join other companies. (Some quit right at a year. I'm guessing they were offered large bonuses if they stuck around for a year.) The only people left were, in general, those who couldn't be bothered to move on.

I had three weeks paid vacation and unlimited sick time, and was about to go up to four weeks paid vacation when Oracle took it all away.
