There's a cafeteria too (food provided by Sodexo). It's not free but at least you don't have to go offsite if you forgot to bring your own lunch in or skipped breakfast at home.", "cons": "WHERE DO I START?! Oracle is, by far, the worst company I've ever worked for. The topics that I will be covering in my review are as follows: 1) Compensation/Deception; 2) Poor Management and Leadership; 3) The Corporate Culture; 4) Dishonor to Customers and Employees.\r\n\r\n1.\tCompensation/Deception: During the interview process, you\u2019re likely to be sold on the fact that Oracle is a large company and there will be a never-ending line of support from various resources and you\u2019re not going to be setup to fail. These are all FALSE. First, as a Presales Engineer, you\u2019re not going to be paid based on your aligned territory\u2019s success but rather how Oracle\u2019s North America sales org does. My manager implied that I would be in a good position because, \u201cjust look at Oracle\u2019s stock! Check out their quarterly numbers!\u201d Well, quarterly and yearly numbers posted publicly are based on Oracle as a WHOLE. North America didn\u2019t even hit 50% of their number in my first Q4 with the company. Well, Q4 also happened to be my first full quarter with the company. Something that was not made fully clear was that you will be on a program called \u201cramp\u201d which, unlike other sales companies, is the opposite of what you might think. First quarter with Oracle, you will qualify for only 25% of your bonus, second quarter you\u2019ll qualify for 50%, third 75%, and 4th full quarter with Oracle you\u2019ll finally get 100% of your bonus. 4th quarter is supposed to be the biggest quarter for any sales company, my assumption is that I would be getting an acceptable payout. Well, I actually only got 25% of 50% of the bonus I should have gotten. So, let\u2019s say, for example, my quarterly bonus should have been $1,000.00. Oracle\u2019s NA sales hit 50%, that takes my bonus to $500.00. Then I REALLY only get 25% of that, which turns into $125.00. That\u2019s what happened in my first quarter. Second quarter, my bonus was actually worse than the first. Then in my third quarter, our compensation plan was adjusted so that we would not be recognized for any on-premises sales until we hit a certain threshold of cloud sales. Oracle Cloud is not popular, think about it. I immediately confronted my management about it and the response was something along the lines of, \u201cwe had this conversation. You knew about this.\u201d Rewinding back to the interview, I\u2019d explicitly asked, \u201chistorically, how well have people on our team received 100% or more of their bonus?\u201d The short response was, \u201cSince I\u2019ve been their manager, every member has received 100%.\u201d Ok, well that sounds fair. Fast forward back to the current discussion where I was confronting management, I objected to what my manager was saying to me about this conversation we had. Their response was along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s based on metrics. You received 100% of the 25% of 50%.\u201d In that moment, I\u2019d realized that we got, as one of my teammates who onboarded with me stated, \u201cbamboozled\u201d. I spoke with the other presales engineers who started with me and they had asked similar questions during the interview with similar responses. Our manager knew what we were asking and chose to respond in literal terms rather than give us the answer we were looking for. I suspect that their fear was that we would not have accepted the job offer had we known the truth. Expect a 65/35 split (65% base, 35% non-existent bonus).\r\n\r\n2. Poor Management & Leadership: Unfortunately, I did not meet one inspiring leader at Oracle. My manager was an extreme hypocrite, took full credit for any initiative that direct reports took upon themselves, beyond egotistical, and micromanaged to an intrusive degree. The expectation was that we all come into the office every day. Our manager showed up to the office maybe once or twice a week (maybe) and we never saw them when they did show up. The excuse was that \u201ctraffic was too much\u201d from where they lived. One of my peers lives 90 minutes away in another state and they made it into the office every day. I don\u2019t see why a 10-mile drive trumps a commute from another state. How can you micromanage from afar? By forcing us to review every single thing we do with management. We were expected to enable our sales team to sell products that they did not get paid for. Every time we were expected to deliver a presentation or training, we had to go through a series of content reviews and deliveries with management where they would be critiqued to an unreasonable degree. Mind you, much of our team had strong experience and background with presenting and coaching people. We weren\u2019t new to technology. When we did challenge management on certain practices, the response would be along the lines of \u201ctoo bad, I\u2019m the boss and this is how I run MY team.\u201d Eventually, we started to realize that the things we were being forced to do were not to benefit our sales team or us, but rather to make our manager look like a superstar to their management. What our boss didn\u2019t realize is that the things we were tasked to do were pushing our boundaries too far. Being paid as an hourly worker (strange for any presales position), we were only allowed to log 40 hours per week when we were doing 50-60 hours\u2019 worth of work to meet expectations. I\u2019ve only ever worked for sales companies where the customer comes first before all else. I\u2019d be reprimanded if I put a customer meeting that we\u2019d scheduled a week in advance before irrelevant Oracle training scheduled 18 hours in prior. Another thing that needs to be said is that my manager did not come from a technical background and did not understand anything about technology. How can you run a technical team if you don\u2019t understand anything they sell?\r\n\r\n3. The Corporate Culture: Depressing. I did not meet anybody happy to work at Oracle or passionate about the products we had to sell. I came into the office every day and everyone was miserable. Oracle has a college hire program where they recruit from top schools around the country. Some of the people I met at Oracle certainly deserved to be put in such a miserable position right out of college. But then there were others who did want to do well in sales but were put in a position to fail. There were few openings for promotion so they were expected to put in a lot of work for very little pay. I feel bad for them to not understand what it feels like to win a big deal or add value to their territory. Even over lunch, our offsite lunches were us going back and forth about how bad of a decision it was to accept Oracle\u2019s offer for employment. Almost every member of my former team has left Oracle since I\u2019d started (I worked at Oracle for less than a year, average tenure is around 6 months; you\u2019re a veteran if you\u2019ve been with Oracle for more than 24 months).\r\n\r\n4. Dishonor to Customers and Employees: When you set your employees up for failure, they will surely fail. The metrics to achieve success are unattainable unless you cover some accounts that are seriously dependent upon Oracle with guaranteed spend. After I\u2019d given my two-weeks\u2019 notice, I was walked out the same day even though I was not leaving for a competitor and was told that I would be receiving pay for two weeks (pretty common practice). I spent nearly two months calling Oracle about the pay I\u2019d been promised but not received and was ultimately told that Oracle would not honor that commitment to me. We were always told that overtime would not be approved which is why we had to only put in 40 hours in our time cards but it was impossible to accomplish any of our work without going over the 40 hours. We often had to work on undocumented hours so Oracle would save the cost of overtime. \r\nMany of my customers were looking to get off Oracle to migrate to MS SQL. The only thing I could do was try to sell them tools to make that possible. Why are so many customers leaving? Because Oracle, by default, has all of their (licensed) application options enabled by default. If you\u2019re new to Oracle, you wouldn\u2019t know better. Once their auditing team comes in and sees that you\u2019ve been \u201cusing\u201d options that you haven\u2019t paid for they will force you to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars if you want to have Oracle continue support on your investment. I cannot see how Oracle will continue to grow in the future.\r\n\r\nOne final note, if you work in Applications sales then you are set up for more success than any other pillar. There\u2019s fewer design considerations and the products are things that can be demo\u2019d to customers. Expect a lot of struggle if you cover any other pillar.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve met a handful of former Oracle employees since I\u2019ve departed and it seems as though the negative experiences I\u2019ve had are not specific to my team. I do not normally write reviews like this but I wish that as critical as mine existed when I\u2019d first started to consider to work at Oracle. I was once asked if I could reach out to my professional network to see if anyone would want to be considered to work on our team\u2026 I\u2019d said that I would not want to ever ruin a good friendship in that way. The worst career decision I\u2019ve made is joining Oracle. If you\u2019re in sales, don\u2019t make the same mistake we did. Look elsewhere. Reach out to somebody you know who works at Oracle if you\u2019ve read this and are not convinced with anything I\u2019ve said here."}, {"review_title": "Not recommended for anything except brand name", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Applications Developer in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Brand Name, Job security, Access to online library, lots of parties, Company does not enforce any attendance or min working hours or even the time/place you chose to work on, so as long as you are doing your job, nothing else matters", "cons": "Products use old technologies which are no longer relevant or up to date with current technologies, Manager is God so whatever he decides is the truth, lot of pressure, might need to work on weekends very frequently, lot of pressure, little learning"}, {"review_title": "Consultant", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fun, good people, good social life\r\nSalary and benefits\r\nOpportunity\r\nLearning\r\nMany technologies and clients\r\nwell organised", "cons": "Very large, confusing array of products and pricing\r\nunnecessary changes to people, positions and plans\r\nbureaucratic - although I moved here from Anaplan (much smaller) and strangely everything here is much faster and better organised"}, {"review_title": "Those were the days!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "7 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Consulting Member of Technical Staff in Sunnyvale, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I was with Oracle for a very long time.

Even then, you are not guaranteed anything which is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nAlso, as an analyst you get no bonus and have only 13 days of PTO vs unlimited for the regular consultants. Not a huge deal and is probably fair for your first year or so but after that you are expect to do literally the same work so it is bit ridiculous. It took over 6 months after being promised a promotion to actually get it for me and I had met every req they laid out in front of me.\r\n\r\nManagement is also completely out of touch with anything. I just went through my 3rd reorg of the year and my new boss (also 3rd of the year) has hundreds direct reports. This sends a clear signal that they really just don't care about individuals. \r\n\r\nMorale overall is just low right now. There are definitely worse jobs but everyone I talk to is either angry or miserable. A lot of this comes from the 0 accountability culture here coming from sales and management.

Oracle Banking Platform, a self proclaimed next generation banking platform is a failed product. \r\n\r\nIt was supposed to be a banking platform suite for tier 1 banks, but it looks like an epic failure. The product is under development for over 6 years now. No bank bought it ! :) A social networking platform like Facebook with over billions of users was developed way faster than this! \r\n\r\nThe reason for mentioning Facebook is coz the dev staff, particularly the higher management think of it as no less than Facebook <laughs>. Cheers ! \r\n\r\nVery arrogant management. Even the HR doesn't help once you get into this product development. (Ive heard a story where an employee complained and when the HR spoke to the manager, manager replied to HR .. \"Fine, you get the product developed then\". Managers abuse and talk. The will not hesitate to use fowl language (\"F\" words in particular\") as prelude to your name. \r\n\r\nDeadlines and work timings: This part is completely messed up. You are supposed to be in office by 9:00 AM. People will expect you to be on your desk at 10:30 PM. Managers say and I quote \"there is no such thing as work life balance\". The supervisors won't hesitate to send you back home if you are late for work. Every 5 day work is expected in 1 day, regarding the deadlines. \r\n\r\nAppraisals: Need I say something. A culture like this will give rise to low appraisals. No growth. Only growth for people who are willing to dedicate their lives to a failed product. (That too 10% hikes, you really want that ? :) ) \r\n\r\nAbove all, I felt that the self respect and dignity of an employee is brutally stamped on. They will do everything to snap your confidence and make you feel like a bonded labour. \r\n\r\nNot to mention, every saturday is a working saturday. So they will ensure that you don't go for any interviews or drives. Its a place where the time you spend at your desk matters more than the work and deliverables. \r\n\r\nTechnically, the product has so many design and technical flaws that it will take ages to repair that. Any engineer working at this is treated to a humungous codebase which is like the worst code in the world. All the coding standards are thrown out of the window. They rely on powerful servers and oracle architecture to ensure high performance of a badly written code. (Exadata and Exalogic in particular). The product is an outcome of a bad SDLC, bad design etc. In the words of a friend, the SDLC here is like testing, then coding and then functional and then design :). Its going to be an epic failure as you can see. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I feel that Oracle Banking Platform, prod dev is a team is going no where and will be scrapped in sometime.

When speaking to HR (not all HR but mine and another specifically for a team member) they are sided with the managers. Even pointing out evidence of how the treatment is shown. (Creates a sense of helplessness). \r\n3.) Managers leave early and majority of the time not in their office, taking 2-3 hour lunch breaks, coming to work late and leaving early. The employees who they manage don't say anything since their job/territory/success within the company becomes jeopardized or work environment becomes a living hell.\r\n4.)

Hands down the best work/life balance in the industry if you're okay with living on a base salary.

Just attain at least 30% of your quota.\r\n6.  Benefits are great.\r\n7.  Great place to network and look for your next role.", "cons": "Look, Oracle's senior leadership is focused on shareholder value. That's their job and they're doing that. That strategy seems to be paying off for now and they know more about how to do that then I ever will. This post is simply to inform GOOD sales reps of the current situation in field sales at Oracle. If you're just starting a career in sales or have struggled in sales, this post is not for you. Oracle might be a good place to develop early in your career (see pros above) and as I said, it's a GREAT place for those who want to lay low and spend time with their families and have great work life balance.    \r\n\r\nMy Review:\r\n\r\nI've been at Oracle for five years now in field sales. Like me, good sales reps come to Oracle to make money because that's the Oracle reputation. Oracle is still relying on that reputation to pull good people over. Let me be clear - there are very few people making any money in field sales at Oracle and you will not get one of those roles. Due to this, the turnover in field sales is tremendously high for good people, moral is as low as it could be, and the culture is awful. Anyone here a year has moved to a new team, has left, or is looking. Mid-level managers (RM's up to GVP's) have no ability to get creative to retain good people. They're making an investment by getting the title so they can move on too.\r\n\r\nMangers up to the GVP level are seen as tactical by senior leadership. They have absolutely no ability to affect change or be strategic in their roles. Their hands are tied with quota assignment, accounts, territories, and the size of their team. They're basically highly paid babysitters.       \r\n\r\nMy Advice if you are seeking a role at Oracle:\r\n\r\n1.  Force Oracle to give you a non-recoverable draw like others in the industry or don't come here. That minimizes your risk a little and gives you some time to see if what they told you is real and see for yourself.  \r\n2.  Get a much higher base salary than you think you're worth since that's what you'll live on for your career indefinitely. \r\n3.  Set your expectations to learning and networking since making money is not an option.\r\n4.  Once here, be nice to everyone since you'll be looking for a job soon and they'll be your peers or entry into new job opportunities (external and internal) later in your career when you've realized your mistake."}, {"review_title": "Challenging but fiscally rewarding", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "23 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Area Manager in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunity to make good money.

During the relocation they don't keep you in the loop about any charges but eventually you will figure out that signing up for a PPS number cost you about 600 euros and opening a bank account cost you an additional 600 euro.

If you want to get into sales, Oracle is a fantastic place to start... \r\n\r\nBenefits are fantastic as well. Insurance and other benefits a like are top notch.", "cons": "Where to start, there are a lot of them:\r\n\r\n- First of all Oracle is a HUGE micromanager: From team syncs every morning, to call & e-mail tracking, and forced daily call blitz's they leave no stone unturned. Oracle is the only organization that I've ever worked at where it is standard practice for managers to ask you open your Outlook and check your sent e-mails.\r\n- Your calendar isn't yours: This goes along with the micromanagement aspects of Oracle. In any given week, you can count on a \"minimum\" of five hours of mandatory training.\r\n- Horrible Account Management Practices: In Oracle's Enterprise practice, there could be more than 80+ different reps (some selling the same products as you) calling into the same account. This creates in-fighting between teams for revenue dollars and account attention. Creating massive customer service issues, lost deals, and constantly fighting internal teams.\r\n- Horrible Commission Practice: First, They make you sign a 80+ page T&C's document, that basically says that they can do whatever they want with your commission and there is nothing you can do about it. Then they play games with commissions and commission amounts. Googling \"Oracle Commissions Lawsuit\" will pull up numerous examples.\r\n- Commission is either really good or really bad, there is no middle ground: Typically two or three reps on any given team are knocking the cover off the ball and the rest are barely making ends meet. Oracle unlike any place I've ever worked, talent does not equal success. Accounts are bunched up into \"Patches\". some of these Patches are great accounts with solid purchase histories; others are full of accounts that been audited several times, tired of the 80+ reps spamming them, or do not standardize on Oracle at all. If you are part of the Cloud team, you can count on almost no commission. In Oracle's Enterprise team alone, there has been a 60 - 70% rep and management turn-over in fiscal 2017 because of this.\r\n- Needlessly Complex Systems: Oracle has a ridiculous amount of systems that are needed to do your \"daily\" job. Twenty different applications is an understatement here. Furthermore, the process to actually receive deal approvals, drafted contracts, and bookings deals; is similar to getting a law passed by today's congress. Reps can spend days on end working with deal management for approvals. It recently took me three weeks to get an approval on one item.\r\n- Your just a number: Regardless of what they say, you are just a number. The \"Class Of\" program was designed to replace reps as they leave so that there is no lack of a \"butt\" in a seat. Furthermore, Oracle also has adopted an +1 position; where the sole role of that person is to sit and wait to replace someone on their team the minute they leave. And yes the turn over is that high, again this year alone in 10 months my division has lost somewhere around 70 - 80% of the staff.  \r\n- Lack of stability: In my just over a year with Oracle, I've had four different managers, two different teams. two different account sets, two different product sets, and three different commission plans due to constant restructuring and turn over.\r\n- Moving around departments is not as easy as they say: You pick a role, you're pretty much stuck at that role for 18 months at a minimum most likely longer.\r\n- Swim-Lanes: Oracle has a cap on commissions called \"Swim-Lanes\" for Inside sales (OD), this cap could be anywhere from $100,000 - $200,000 on bookings (not commission)... Meaning if you find a deal that grows beyond that Swim-Lane number, you receive little to no commission beyond it. This also create an issue with the field, because if they \"find\" a deal before you that grows beyond that \"Swim-Lane\" number they receive credit for the entire deal and you get \"nothing\".\r\n- Field vs Inside (OD): This also creates another issue, Field over rules OD almost every time. So, regardless if you really \"find\" a deal first, they can and will steal it and you will have little to no retaliation to keep that deal. Even if you do all the proper things \"management\" tells you to do, they are typically too new or bogged down with other work to really help fight for that revenue.\r\n- New Year Shake Up: Every Fiscal New Year (June), you are almost 100% guaranteed to receive completely new set of accounts, losing all the progress you've made with your \"Enterprise\" accounts throughout the year. This also means, you lose any deals that might push into the new year as well. So, if you've worked 10 months on a six figure deal and it pushes into the new year, it was all for nothing. Sure, they have approvals to \"hold\" these deals but its never guaranteed, its a very complex process, and good luck getting commission.\r\n\r\nNow there is a caveat to what I've written above. My experience was limited to Oracle's Enterprise Team and some bullets relate only to that department but a lot falls true to Oracle as a whole...  Quite honestly, Oracle was the worst overall experience I've ever had in my professional career and I wouldn't recommend to anyone!  Except if you are new to sales; with all their training and micromanagement, they will give you a great base of knowledge to start your career."}, {"review_title": "Sales in Amsterdam", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Applications Sales Representative in Amsterdam", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary\nGood bonus system\nGood conditions\nGood facilities\nNice people\nYoung team\nEnough training\nFun events\n\nGood company to work for, you learn a lot and you are given space to improve yourself.", "cons": "No flexible working/not enough freedom\nInternal politics\nLong internal processes which is common at such a large organization\nTargets are quite high"}, {"review_title": "Great company!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Enterprise Technology Consultant in Redwood Shores, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I get to work with some of the best and brightest minds in the development of machine learning and cloud computing.

Not any of the reasons above. \r\n3) The few attempts at BDC's trying to establish a culture will be eradicated by management immediately through some thoroughly schizophrenic behavior. Example: \"Decorate your desks to show team spirit and individualism.\" (one week later a corporate bigwig shows up) \"tear down these hideous decorations and clean your desks\"\r\n4) don't ever question your target, training or anything put in front of you. Accept, nod and perform. \r\n5) You will constantly be pushed into trainings, meetings, huddles, 1on1's and other completely useless assembly. This is to battle your 'downtime' (time not spent on the phone). They do not grasp the concept of work that doesn't include the use of a telephone. \r\n6) They go to a level of analysis to check your activity levels that borderlines on invasive. Yet, should you question your targets, you will be told that such 'granular' analysis isn't being done for targets. \r\n7) You have mandatory vacation days, which will be approved, but will also be reviewed and potentially revoked, should you not perform. So you book holidays in advance, take your HR demanded minimum days off, and should you not be on target, they might tell you you can't go. \r\n\r\nBy now you should see that it's probably better to get work as a North Korean farmer. It's not a joke how big of a joke this company is.

Let's start off with how Oracle likes to do business. Oracle likes to believe that at the expense of customer satisfaction and customer retention, bombarding customers with cold calls/emails from every possible angle is the best sales strategy to implement. There is no sense of strategic prospecting or serious high-level customer engagement. Business Development and Account Managers are expected to make 40-50 dials a day - how exactly do you think customers feel about receiving 5-6 calls a day from different Oracle folks trying to hit this metric? That's not even mentioning the fact that when multi-product deals are on the table, the amount of bickering and backstabbing that occurs between salesmen of different product pillars. To give you a personal anecdote - I have personally brought forward a sales opportunity before regarding one product, only to have the other product pillar come in, engage the customer about something completely unrelated, and completely ruin the opportunity for everybody already involved. How is that for collaboration, something that Oracle strives to \"cultivate\"?\r\n\r\n-It is a very top-down culture. There seems to be a prevailing notion that there are nine degrees of separation between employees and upper management and the way things are run around here, that is definitely the case, the most recent example being the Q4 bonus. Although bonuses are always contingent upon performances of the entire org, the cut in bonuses was addressed with no accountability by upper management, leaving people who have put in their hard work and effort for that bonus confused, disappointed, and ultimately bitter. When a company's upper management can't deliver or take accountability for measures that impact people's satisfaction here, chaos develops internally. I wonder how that chaos portrays to customers outside of Oracle. Would you be willing to invest in a company that doesn't have its internal operations organized?\r\n\r\n-Speaking of operations, let's talk briefly about people get promoted internally. When salespeople hit their quotas, it seems upper management sees fit to promote them based on their success in sales, DESPITE their lack of history in developing managerial skills. The result? Too many managers who have no idea how to manage people. With so many people who have no idea how to manage a team, people get discouraged and want to leave the company. The worst part is that for the sake of hitting quotas and making more money, some of these managers tell their employees to do whatever it takes, cultivating a culture stressing to only seek to help yourself and destroying any sense of integrity within the sales organization. There is no shortage of cheating and lying and people who don't deserve promotions get promoted while the honest, hard-working folks get thrown under the rug for doing the right thing.\r\n\r\n-Class Ofs are not respected here. In fact, some of the more senior folks look at them with disdain and wonder why they were even hired in the first place.

I have been with Oracle for over 10 years. I write this to give potential candidates a real look into the company. Someone who has been with the company 6-24 months may not have a very wide view since you are required to stay in a position for a year and people rarely leave their area. I have worked in several different areas across my time at the company. I came on board via an acquisition. Good Luck!\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining & Development \u2013 In my 10 years here, I have never witnessed any dedicated employee development. I have watched employees ask for training and development over and over and have been denied. The management strategy in the consulting groups that juggle several products is horrible. A lot of the management doesn\u2019t really understand how software products are learned, configured and deployed, so they have no idea about training people to be proficient in them. In the past 24 months I have watched people go to customers with no training on technologies they have sold to customers. This has caused a lot of customer contempt and just embarrassment from the consulting side. With the launch of the cloud there was no strategy and no strategy for deploying applications on the cloud. The company actually gave zero education on the \u201ccloud\u201d. If you get into one area and you want to learn about another, forget it. In my 10 years with Oracle I have watched less than 5 people move from the area they were originally in to another area. If you do get training it will be haphazard, videos, slides, and mostly useless. On the contrary, they will actually make employees pay for the most recent training and customer training is good and expensive.\r\n\r\nManagement \u2013 there are many thick and useless layers of management. Many of them with very little technology and or real IT experience. There is also a practice of moving managers who have had their hands slapped from HR for harassing their employees. The managers are not there to develop their employees and will do whatever they have to do to pay them very little and not make a big deal regarding recognition that may result in a raise. Many managers will throw their employees under the bus because they believe their employees can\u2019t move on or out of the group. In some of the smaller units or acquisitions, many of the managers are friends of someone who is above them and this creates a really big problem because most of the people are not qualified to work in any field in IT. It has driven moral to an all-time low for the people who are actually interested in learning different areas of tech and even for the people who actually know how to do their job and can talk \u201cshop\u201d because their manager is usually someone who never did the job or got the job via a friend or acquisition.\r\n\r\nSalaries & Raises \u2013 as many have mentioned here, the lowest in the industry. Actually kind of laughable at this point. What is making things really worse is that companies that are being acquired are able to create positions that get by legal and have salaries attached and these people get the salaries when they come to Oracle. Case in point is an administrative assistance becoming an implementation consultant after acquisition with no experience. This happens all the time and then the person is in the role and comes in contact with people who have real expectations of the role and they try to talk their way out of it and end up looking foolish. I have watched people apply for a level 4 position, get offered the position and then they are told the level 4 position is no longer available, but they have to take the job because they were offered the job and their old job is not available. HR is helpless and really is not on the side of any employee. I have also witnessed situations where an employee was promoted, but actually made less money.\r\n\r\nWork-Life Balance \u2013 I have heard this verbatim as being the most common reason people stay. I recently heard working from home as being the reason someone didn\u2019t take a recent job offer. I\u2019m sorry, but working from home shouldn\u2019t be the reason you stay at a company, but I get it. That\u2019s where the company does one thing right. People are able to work from home and really not have to put in a full week and for some, not even a full day. It has become very clear that very few at the management level are putting in anywhere close to 30 hours a week. People are just collecting a check and responding to emails here and there. For someone with drive, initiative or a willingness to just work hard, this type of life will really cramp your style. For the people who use the company as their part-time job, it\u2019s probably the greatest thing in the world. For people who don\u2019t care at all, it\u2019s also probably great.\r\n\r\nThe Cloud \u2013 applications on the cloud were deployed with very little strategy or education to the employees. They will never catch Amazon. They might not even catch Microsoft. They are trying to bring programmers from both companies over by suggesting a \u201cclean slate\u201d cloud to develop on, but if any of them is stupid enough to leave those top tier companies, then they deserve to be here."}, {"review_title": "Complicated dynamics", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Exposure and experience to wide range of communication technologies", "cons": "Many times their business units are formed by piecing together former smaller companies, so people tend to \"work for\" their smaller groups, many situations will arise out of that.

Oracle's latest \u201cemployee development\u201d program literally has employees filling out word docs about their goals and such. Basically what people did in 1999. As for actual training, for the courses someone might need to improve in their jobs or become more skills, Oracle will charge you thousands of dollars to take them.

These are setup as videos for the most part, so you're just watching powerpoint slides go by and once you're done, there's no real reinforcement. In my time here I have not watched one person be developed from a hire to employee to management. Usually in a decade you would have one or two examples of progression.\r\n\r\nManagement \u2013 There are many thick and useless layers of management. Many of them with very little technology and or real IT experience. When Oracle acquires smaller companies, if they are under the GBU framework, the company can basically say, a janitor is now a Senior Director and no questions are asked. I have watched scores of people come in that way and just leapfrog over people who have been in the unit for decades. It's even more embarrassing when the people who have been there basically know 10 times more about everything and the new member of management just sits around being social and not really contributing. I've also never seen the same members of management sit in the same exact positions for decades. These managers stay in office longer than presidents. Their attitudes are smug and many are downright hated by their team members. The thing is, you work in a tech company and you should know the buzz words or at least know what they mean. I have been in meetings where a director actually said to someone two levels below them that, \u201cthat's not their job to know how to do this or that...that's on you to know...\u201d At Oracle, as opposed to many other companies I have worked at, to be in management, you do not need to have been good at any one particular job or the jobs of your team. It is truly amazing. My thought is they stay because no companies really want them.\r\n\r\nSalaries & Raises \u2013 as many have mentioned here, the lowest in the industry. I have watched people get lied to about money, I have watched colleagues be sold one job and think they were getting their \u201clevel\u201d raise only for the manager to remove the job and create another job that was a lateral move. You are around some really scummy low down people.  This is not like the big and successful tech companies. This is basically the lowest end of tech. With that being said, you need to do something remarkable to get any type of raise. You need to really beat everyone on your team and basically be perfect for 12 months. And even then, quite the stretch. Management that are friends with other managers will also have an impact on those things. I have gotten raises in my time here, but with salaries being so low, it's not a lot. As mentioned before, if you get in via an acquisition, you could get a nice bump from what you were making, but that's up for negotiation between Oracle and the old company. \r\n\r\nWork-Life Balance \u2013 The single reason I have heard anyone stays here is because they can work from home and get their work done in 4-5 hours a day. That's really the biggest benefit of the company and don't think anyone would argue. \r\n\r\nThe Cloud \u2013 applications on the cloud were deployed with very little strategy or education to the employees. They will never catch Amazon. They will never catch Microsoft. Management wants to tout the cloud as being a success, but it's basically because customers are basically strong-armed into going to it and they are flat out lied to when speaking about the overall performance of the cloud. There is also a mentality among management and long time employees that Oracle is better than Amazon. Anyone who knows the tech sector right now, knows that's laughable. At Oracle, they can't even speak about their competition because they're getting beaten so bad. What's worse is that there are smaller companies that are now coming up that have better products, better platforms, cheaper price and less problems."}], [{"review_title": "Great starting job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Mar 2018", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Redwood City, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have a very good manager, which means the world at Oracle - cause managers at large determines if you have a nice team", "cons": "Lack of perks and care for employees comparing to other companies.

It is truly amazing. My thought is they stay because no companies really want them.\r\n\r\nSalaries & Raises \u2013 as many have mentioned here, the lowest in the industry. I have watched people get lied to about money, I have watched colleagues be sold one job and think they were getting their \u201clevel\u201d raise only for the manager to remove the job and create another job that was a lateral move. You are around some really scummy low down people.  This is not like the big and successful tech companies. This is basically the lowest end of tech. With that being said, you need to do something remarkable to get any type of raise. You need to really beat everyone on your team and basically be perfect for 12 months. And even then, quite the stretch. Management that are friends with other managers will also have an impact on those things. I have gotten raises in my time here, but with salaries being so low, it's not a lot. As mentioned before, if you get in via an acquisition, you could get a nice bump from what you were making, but that's up for negotiation between Oracle and the old company. \r\n\r\nWork-Life Balance \u2013 The single reason I have heard anyone stays here is because they can work from home and get their work done in 4-5 hours a day. That's really the biggest benefit of the company and don't think anyone would argue. \r\n\r\nThe Cloud \u2013 applications on the cloud were deployed with very little strategy or education to the employees. They will never catch Amazon. They will never catch Microsoft. Management wants to tout the cloud as being a success, but it's basically because customers are basically strong-armed into going to it and they are flat out lied to when speaking about the overall performance of the cloud. There is also a mentality among management and long time employees that Oracle is better than Amazon. Anyone who knows the tech sector right now, knows that's laughable. At Oracle, they can't even speak about their competition because they're getting beaten so bad. What's worse is that there are smaller companies that are now coming up that have better products, better platforms, cheaper price and less problems."}, {"review_title": "Self service", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "27 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great technology and innovation,   great career development and training, opportunity to move around organisation, great career advancement if you put the work into networking.

Negative reinforcement is not a good management technique and drives away intelligent employees. \n\nThe sales reps I worked with were mostly clueless with a few exceptions. Sales managers simply barked at those reps, causing the reps who needed coaching to flail and then fail. I cannot tell you how many sales forecast calls I was on where the managers just berated their sales reps. No help just a beat down. Most sales reps have no idea what their products do, nor do they understand how to sell them. \n\nI spent eight years at Oracle, never got a pay raise despite service above and beyond the call of duty. A friend who was a manager said that is normal. You are expected to move jobs annually to make more money. \n\nYou must keep track of what you do in fifteen minute intervals in multiple tools. The administrative overhead is really bad. \n\nTraining is a joke, you only get the marketing slide decks, never get a chance to really use the technology you sell. \n\nYour customers will hate you because the rep before you may have done an audit to them and raped them so they can get a big pay check on the way out the door. \n\nLots of arrogant colleagues that care nothing about their customers or coworkers makes this a very challenging place to work. Very cut throat unhealthy workplace. \n\nThe work - life balance at Oracle is a joke. Burnout is rampant. I had two colleagues leave and rather than hire replacements, I was asked to take up the slack, for a year and a half. All major account executives (CADs) are divorced, in the process of getting a divorce, or are terminally single due to their personalities. \n\nI know I have just written a lot of negative things about Oracle, but I tried very hard to make it work.

At that point everyone had the impression it best not to ask questions out of concern of appearing to challenge the most recent change.\r\n\r\nMy sense was training was not coherent. Yes, there were centralized authorities for those in contract management, but not everyone - especially some senior staff - followed them. Additionally, policies were often posted in multiple places which were not all updated at the same time. Some who had been at Oracle for a long time were comfortable with this, but I often observed divergence in how senior staff would handle the same type of engagement. Outside of authorities to do the job, all training was online. The company did not value in-person training or associated training outside of work. One colleague sought to take some contracting courses at a local college and was told a very quick no.\r\n\r\nIn my view this is not a good company to work for.

I am having to rely on coworkers who are already stretched too thin, and documentation that is sparse and threadbare, if I can find it. Often it is not searchable or understandable to a noob like me. It is missing steps, and often is ten years old, written way before many iterations of the software. There are many things that the documentation refers to but does not explain. For example, it may say that a field exists and can't be changed, but no attempt is made to explain what changes will do. \r\n\r\nThe training videos dump me into very advanced content. It's like throwing a kindergartener into a chemical engineering class. It's not that the kindergartener is stupid, it's just that they have no basis for what is being taught. \r\n\r\nThe software itself is embarrassing, missing functionality that existed in the desktop version, and I'm amazed at how nonintuitive it is - i.e. don't put the iteration number in the field that says iteration number or the system will reject, and do you see the tiny icon that is greyed out? Yes, that's what you should click on. Counterintuitive is the new intuitive, I guess. What used to be able to be done on one screen is now done in many different places throughout the software, with each screen taking a long time to load. So now users can do some of the same functions, only with more steps. Even things that look like they should work, as in all the pieces are there, don't.\r\n\r\nMy coworkers, who aren't given raises and are now not allowed overtime, are expected to train me in between working their own SRs and dealing with  customers who are understandably impatient. Many of them are impatient, and would rather spend time telling me that I should know something or figure it out, than to teach me and help me understand. I have never worked so hard to learn so little, and when someone is kind enough to really help me, I find myself wondering if I should send them an enormous gift basket. I have spent an inordinate amount of time trying to test the software only to find out later that I was going in a terribly wrong direction - I would say misguided, but often I am left to my own devices.\r\n\r\nI'm embarrassed when I talk to customers and with a few minutes it's very apparent to them that I don't know what I'm doing. I'm embarrassed that it takes so long to give them an action plan.\r\n\r\nWhen I talk to friends about Oracle, they often say that their software tends to combine new technology in some places with old clunky programming in others, and this is certainly the case. Drag and drop doesn't exist yet and what sounds like a simple task can take hours and sometimes days. As one developer friend of mine put it, \"Oracle doesn't hire programmers, they hire attorneys\".\r\n\r\nManagers are typical of most companies, loyal to the bureaucracy. It seems everyone there has a story of how they've been treated terribly by one of the managers, and I can't say I'm an exception. One manager even glares at me as I walk around the building - I don't even know her!\r\n\r\nMy computer came in a box along with all the peripherals, and when I didn't know how to set it up I was once again at the mercy of coworkers who already had lots to do. I constantly feel like I'm stealing time from others in order to get my work done and I hate that. \r\n\r\nIt is company policy that work must be done in the office. I'd love to live someplace cheaper - I'm not getting paid that much and can't anticipate a raise. Often when on calls, one can hear people in the background, sometimes so loud that they seem to be part of the call, and we start trying to respond to them or ask them to clarify, and the person we need to be listening can't be heard.  \r\n\r\nThe building is often an uncomfortable temperature. Some rooms are too hot, some are too cold, space heaters aren't allowed.\r\n\r\nAs far as the new approachable Oracle goes, many of the managers and people who really know the software are very unapproachable.

No or trivial increases and bonuses for anyone I know for the past 5 years.

No one cares that the dev environments or tools needed to do the job are unavailable.  Demands are to close bugs not to fix the root causes.  Dev environments are so unstable that efficiency is minimal.  PMs can be responsible for aps for which they don't even have working environments to use.  Acronyms are rampant and no one knows what half of them mean.  There is no onboarding training of new people and no way to find out half of what you need to do your job.  People with 10 yrs of tenure still don't know basic things about how related processes work.  There are no internal resources for finding out who to talk to about a particular product or tool or internal business process that is critical to your job.  Instead lots of people just use do an email blitz (ie. 'spam') asking questions which results in only the most fragmentary knowledge transfer.\r\n\r\nMany teams are dominated by legacy folks that view the status quo, 80s style enterprise software as the ideal and resist any innovation.  Much of the software designs are patterned on 30 yo approaches.  Many PM, Strategy and DEV personnel seem oblivious to the innovations happening right down the road from them.

Turnover is extremely high - 7 of 10 reps on my team have left the company in the past 15 months, only 2 of the 10 hit quota (in each of the last 3 fiscal years). There is no \"team\" i.e. working together or collaborating, sharing institutional insights.  The inside sales team has their own quota and is not structured to work with the field reps.  When I climbed on board I asked my inside sales guy for a list of our accounts and he sent the names of the accounts.  When asked about contact info I was told - you're on your own (I did get the info but it took a week of internal bickering). Other account managers who represent other solutions such as security, database, middleware, webcenter... are your competitors as much as other vendors are - absolutely amazing!!  They work against you in an account to get the customer money off the table for their solution before you can close your deal.  The CRM tool contains no customer information, no history, no nothing.  And it took almost 3 months for me to gain access to what information there was because access has to be approved by the President's office (Mark Hurd\u2019s office - no kidding!!!) Getting things accomplished is complexity to the extreme - the tools used for pricing and other essentials are absolutely not intuitive, there are several different tools needed to accomplish a single pricing request/approval and other sales folks won't easily help (because it doesn\u2019t  benefit them financially).  Which goes back to the beginning - there is no onboarding beyond the compliance stuff online so, integrating and succeeding is more difficult.  Solution training does not exist.  One more thought which absolutely blew me out of my socks - customers don't like us.  They buy because the solutions integrate easily and it makes their lives a bit less painful then having multiple vendors but Oracle leverages that with arrogance. I have followed reps who have left into their former accounts and in first meetings I have been given an earful.  It is hard to earn customer trust because other reps are operating with an agenda that is in their best interest - not necessarily the customer's.  I was with one rep (shortly before he left) who gave the customer a quote for $500K and they went nuts \u2013 he had not bothered to discuss the solution and help them understand it's value to their environment and the ROI.

Incredible brainwashing machine that reminded me of a Ford factory... many online training where people need real management and coaching  ...\r\nSelf service : first day I started the manager was late to welcome me, he threw a PC at my face and didn't say anything, left me by my own in there until end of day, you have to ask people and order everything yourself (phone, keyboard, mouse) Imagine you are man versus Oracle processes, partners, approvals and above all that you have to sell... sometimes you spend more time internally to convince people than to sell ...\r\n- Management : I've never seen a line of managers that inspire such a little amount of motivation and dedication to work, when you work for Oracle in apps, you work mostly for your basic salary and because you are assimilated to a state employee in a government company, Ministery of IT. Change is very slow for anything. Managers are there to give instructions never to inspire to action, they give disproportionate targets compared with what can really be achieved. Else, with a normal company you define a real strategy to follow after few successes to make successes more regular and automatic, with Oracle nope, you swim your way all the time. \r\n- HR: they protect company interests only \r\n- Pricing : pricing \u00e0 are incredibly high for SMB market, up to 90% discounts rates can be asked and approved. Seriously ??? Is this a pricing  strategy guys ? \r\n- Partners : they can refuse at delivery points and screw the work you led during months and months, because They are in a stronger position (I don't know what partner managers are really doing ??) they are not too many and can be not well trained for implementations, so not that great to be successful and get the first references and testimonies (early adopters) \r\n- Admin hassle : i think you can reach a burn out if you spend 3 months in admin hassle with Oracle, I don't wish that for an enemy, worst approval system ever, very suitable for big companies deals and long processes but not to be reactive and competitive in SMB market...\r\n- Product : products are well designed and engineered together very good but they look ugly and from another planet, it can't be competitive with niche players, very often beaten, so the plateform speech works mostly with big players not SMB, see guys ??! Start small will a beautifully designed small product and expand - people buy with emotions not with logic, especially small companies.\r\n- Meritocracy : almost absent lol. Some people can sign because they have the good accounts/ receives opportunities, some people succeed because their partners do everything for them, some people succeed because their managers do everything for them. And above that you have the privilege to see their names and pictures in end of quarters presentation as successful people! \r\n-Salaries : huge disparities between people, some are IC1 / 2/3 and we don't even know why ?? Especially new hires.\r\n- Gratitude : I didn't see it that much, Oracle has a financial logic in a Sales department, we are figures and numbers mostly, it's like football you are punished if you don't score, but they never tell their part of responsibility in the equation, it reminds me of a dictature.

Oracle's business model is to acquire companies -> figure out how much of the engineering can be off-shored to India, and then just keep 5-10 engineers in the US because anything else is expensive.

Then we were bought by oracle. We received 0 pay increases for anyone despite being profitable before we were bought out. Instead there was a systematic stripping of benefits. We used to have free lunches, snacks, regular company outings, parties, runs etc. Not the biggest deal right? but oracle attributes a dollar amount to it and that's all you ever are too. \r\n\r\nI was promoted to Senior Eng. No pay increases. There were several people that left my team because priorities became mismanaged by Oracle. That means more work for the rest of us.  Still no increase. Instead of hiring qualified local candidates we were immediately pushed to outsource. There are now significantly more India devs on my team than U.S. ones. I am also a person of color and I know that there are other people in my position being paid a lot more than I am. \r\n\r\nWork wise, our product was doing very well before we were bought. We thought oracle would mean an influx of money leading to better management and coding practices. Instead we were pushed from day 1 to, instead of focusing on customer needs, use oracle products. Convert all of our applications to use the horribly thought-out OracleDB, instead of PostGres. The database is not user friendly at all and really requires you to be a professional oracle db admin to get off the ground. So now I have to learn this on top of my other work, still no qualified team members, still no pay increases.

Being lowest in the hierarchy makes you take lot of heat. Consulting is the worst performing division of Oracle apparently. The field consultants are the ones who feel the heat of the bad products. \r\nThe only part of consulting that makes money is the consulting sales people. They get commissions based on the engagements with various projects. They are no better than used-car sales people - and can go to any extent to play with consultants. They place one consultant against the other with the customers, and humiliate the consultants. Their only motto is to make the commission on the engagements. This can be noticeably seen with sales people helping small and medium businesses. The large customers usually are referred to the partners or independent contractors. The project managers mint money on these large scale projects.\r\nOn the whole, the consultants suffer with enormous travel, bad working conditions at the customer locations, and hence most of the good consultants leave after spending a few years. Those who cannot risk to venture out stay back. On the whole the Oracle consulting's success rate on the projects is even less than 50%.\r\nThere is no job security in consulting, no career advancement opportunities as the cost center managers do not encourage in-class trainings owing to save money. All you can get to learn is from some online learnings if you are really interested and motivated.

Have been working within several Fortune 100 companies before coming to Oracle. But have not seen the amount of Micromanaging that I've experienced from my manager. Me and my team members receive Pidgin instant messages 3 times within the day (morning/afternoon/evening) \"___, are you there?\". \r\nIf we are within a meeting and can't respond we receive a call and voicemail. When calling them back on the urgency there isen't any, they just wanted to see how we are doing....?!?\r\n\r\nAnother issue is our manager not understanding the needs of the team in supporting us better to help us succeed and make our sales team succeed. This is transparent from our teams one on one conversations with them, discussing what we need from them to be successful. When stating it to them we get the political response of, \"I like that idea, but....\". Although the items we present make logical sense, it does not align with our managers thought process so it gets swiped underneath the rug. When asking our manager on why there is no justification and a simple response of, \"I don't need you to think about that\". \r\n\r\nI've spoke to all my team members and it seems this has been going on for more than 2 years. Alot of the team members are afraid to speak up to upper management since they think our manager and them are buddies, and to speak up with HR you will need solid issues (although many of the things that our manager does makes us question our job everyday). \r\n\r\nBelieve there needs to be a separate person not tied to our manager or any other managers to discuss individually one on one. This will not only provide a clear sense of communication without bias and worry of reprimand, but help provide team members better support from our manager to help grow the Oracle business. \r\n\r\n2.) Although there's online training, would like to see more on-site training workshops given. My manager limits me from participating within any/all trainings other than online ones. This hinders the ability to learn within the growing phases of joining oracle and continuing of a persons knowledge base. \r\n\r\n3.) 401k matching sucks.

In one case there was a code copying issue that was discovered where an entire team was engaged in copying code from another team.  In simple terms, they disabled the other team's code from being released to users and enabled their own version to be released to users all in secret.  When the engineer that discovered this reported it to management several levels high instead of taking action against the code copiers the engineer was retaliated against by placing him under the manager engaged in the code copying.  When the engineer complained about the retaliation he was moved back to the previous manager and then given no work to do and essentially frozen.  HR and management did nothing to make the situation better.\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems that while other groups are hard-working, the CAD org has way too many people sitting around doing nothing except justifying why they need lots of people to make fancy internal CAD tools instead of buying them from external vendors.  I've noticed that a lot of the people in CAD work very short hours and have nothing to do.  If you join Oracle, definitely join design instead of CAD.

There are many positions that are enjoyed by employees and many that are not. My experience stems from the NOT enjoyable perspective which would be anyone in sales or sale management. \nWith that said, I have worked for very large companies (larger than Oracle) and start ups. Oracle is by far the most broken and dysfunctional company I have ever experienced. All of the psychotic dysfunction is masked by the fact that Larry Ellison cornered the Relational Database Market 30+ years ago so the company has a legal license to print money. The consistent revenue stream hides the broken and dysfunctional environment Mark Hurd has put in place for the Sales Organization. He has never done anything to me and this is not personal. My comment is simply based on the insane nature of the policies that he has implemented. Even though I am very successful with Oracle and again they will do everything possible to retain me nothing is worth the mental anguish and pure torture I am experiencing. I don't believe it is possible that there is a more broken and dysfunctional company that exists today or has ever existed in history. It would simply take too much typing to start giving specifics but if you are currently an oracle employee and you are starting to believe there is something wrong with you because  what you are experiencing, hearing, and seeing cannot be possible, don't worry you are not crazy it is actually really happening. Most of the upper  management within the sales organization that I work with were former failed managers that are debt ridden and desperate to retain their large salaries. They simply disregard the dysfunction and beat on everyone to deliver even though they are fully aware of the dysfunction that is impacting your ability to continue to successfully produce. It might be possible but no matter what anyone says, I will NEVER believe that a more toxic, psychotic and dysfunctional environment exists than Oracle Sales. I personally know hundreds of employees in Sales at Oracle and 99% of them are desperate to get out.

Therefore, you're stuck researching for a question that may take a minute to answer but it may take 2-3 days.\r\n- Work hours: Some employees are eligible for OT. However, OT doesn't mean anything. Management enforces this policy heavily and if you have to work 40+ hours a week, you have to tell management and since they don't want to pay you, they will lay out your days and weeks for you, ensuring you won't work over 40 hours. This results in extreme micro managing or working 40+ hours without anyone knowing (which is against policy).\r\n- Management doesn't care about their employees at all.

Deadlines : Complete the work quickly to get more work. Also every five day work expected in one day.\r\n8. Appraisal : Its a biggest joke. Hard working resources will get the highest hike percentage. Which is 10%. Management will delay announcing the hikes year by year and you will end up getting 5-6% hike a year on average only if you are very hard working in nature.
