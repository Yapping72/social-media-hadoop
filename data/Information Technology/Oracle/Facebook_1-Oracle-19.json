This gives you a ton of flexibility in your personal life.\r\n\r\nYou can entertain yourself with the occasional pet project that you find interesting, but you should treat it as more building your portfolio rather than expect it to take off inside the company (there's a lot of red tape and consensus building required  to push any creative or new thinking up the management chain so most creative or inventive projects often die on the vine)\r\n\r\nBeing able to say you work for Oracle\r\n\r\nMostly  intelligent and hard-working colleagues - everyone is generally a B+ (not bad for so huge a place)\r\n\r\nYou can learn about technologies and aspects of the IT footprint you have little knowledge of through osmosis\r\n\r\nLots of options for benefits, and pretty good employee discount programs (Audi, Apple, etc)\r\n\r\nGood place to take shelter in during a recession provided you can prove you're adding value\r\n\r\nGood place to re-charge your batteries if you're burned out from previous jobs and need time to re-group.\r\n\r\nThis is also likely a really good place for new Mom's or Dad's  to hang out that need to be at home while waiting for their kids to start school full time.  Your career trajectory will still look good (because of the Oracle brand) but you won't be so consumed by work that you can't do what you need to do at home (plus you'll be working from home if you prefer).  Then when you and the kids are ready, you can leave for something more challenging  to get back on your career path (it's true and, not being cynical! Many people at Oracle do exactly this!).", "cons": "Title and Salary Don't Move: \r\nThere's a reason why Oracle has some of the best profit margins in the Fortune 500 and that's because they keep the organizational structure VERY flat (there won't be many people between you and Ellison or Hurd, which is really funny to see) and there are very few people in the company that are empowered to promote people or give them a raise.  Chances are your manager has no authority to promote you or give you a raise - regardless of how much they value you.  This keeps things nice and flat for Oracle while maintaining payroll costs,but you can be pretty sure that the salary and title you come in with will be the salary and title you'll leave with.  Also, cost of living adjustments are almost non-existent so you effectively will experience earnings power degradation if you stay 4-5+ years.  Now, there is an exception to this.  If you come in and you end up on a sales comp plan, you can make a lot of money here, but if you're not on a sales plan, your should plan for a flat salary/title trajectory during your tenure.  \r\n\r\nNo Career Development Programs:  \r\nWhat has always been shocking is that there is no \"High Potential Employee\" program at Oracle like most other Fortune 500 companies.  This should tell you quite a lot about Oracle's attitude towards career development.  Also, there is no program for helping you move around inside the company (only an internal job board). So if you think that once you get here you can move around into other business units you'll be disappointed.  If you're looking to switch jobs internally you need to know someone who wants you and has authority to move you (keep in mind: Networking outside your immediate team or business unit is very difficult here because chances are you'll be working remotely).  Otherwise, if you see a position elsewhere in the company that you'd like to try, you might as well be coming in as someone who currently doesn't work for Oracle.  The fact that the company doesn't have any formal employee development or job rotation program (pre-recorded webinars and an internal job board do not count) is really quite crazy since it's a lot cheaper than giving raises or dealing with attrition because it does help people feel like they're being recognized or being rewarded in some way for their efforts.\r\n\r\nDuplicate effort, too much socialization required to get anything done, internal teams competing with each other, ill defined roles and responsibilities: \r\n It's not like this is a secret since Oracle is well known for having multiple sales people calling on the same account with none of them knowing this about the other, but this problem is much more toxic inside the company.  It's not like every large company doesn't suffer from these dynamics, but because of the way the organization is structured, if you are someone that gets a lot of satisfaction from owning and delivering a project from start to finish, you're going to spend a fair amount of time being frustrated and held up by other employees that think they have a right/responsibility to weigh in.  Decision rights can be pretty unclear, but the WORST aspect of this is that you spend a A LOT of time selling things internally and making everyone feel heard versus actually executing on a project. A lot of times, you'll start out with a deliverable that in the ends up looking nothing like what you started off with, and it's not a better deliverable, it's a deliverable with a lot of compromises.  I guess it's almost like getting a Bill through Congress in that regard.  Also, because of this dynamic, many projects simply fizzle or disappear (this is pretty demoralizing after a few years).\r\n\r\nMarketing at Oracle means \"Marketing Communications\" and not the \"Marketing\" that a Product Marketing professional practices\r\nWith everything else above to consider, if you have a product marketing background and are looking to practice this at Oracle, you're going to be pretty disappointed (although see the Pro's about working here since everything is a tradeoff)  The heads of Marketing at Oracle are great event planners, and know how to make a big splash with the brand, but that's really the only thing they are focused on.  The CMO is really not a CMO, but really the Chief Event Planning and Marketing Communications Officer (and she does a great job at it!).  This is in no way a sleight, but positioning, messaging, and market analysis are really orphans within Oracle.  I think this is because the most exectives running the business units and the Sr. Execs don'tt feel like they need to worry about these aspects of marketing given Oracle 's size and market dominance.

This can be an 8-5 job but it is not very strict. Leaving a bit early or coming in a bit late is okay. \r\n\r\n- Though turnover may be high (it's sales), management has been trying to invest in activities for its reps, like covering lunch for the team once a month when the team goes out to eat/drink. \r\n\r\n- Not an \"old school\" sales culture (no heavy dials, though you will have to do it sporadically). I've worked in other sales organizations and Oracle's prospecting efforts in inside sales is very relaxed. This may be good or bad, but overall people like that they can find other ways to reach out to customers instead of pounding 50+ calls a day. \r\n\r\n- Generally, people here are very nice and you will make lots of friends; though some may say Oracle sales is \"fratty\" (it is), people are not mean and you can get along with pretty much anyone. \r\n\r\n- $50K base for a Tier 1 rep is decent and liveable in most places in Austin. You can request an increase after a full year of being at your quota (Tier 2 pay is $65K). \r\n\r\n- Great health benefits and investment plans (401K match and stock options, as well as financial advisory if you want). There is also education reimbursement and a bunch of other stuff. Vacation is 14 days for your first three years (accrued at 0.8 hrs per paycheck; more after three years). Management PTO is unlimited. \r\n\r\n- You can make a lot of money if you work hard, get lucky, have good accounts, a knowledgable manager, and a great field rep who knows what he's doing and is willing to include you in sales cycles. More into this in the cons. \r\n\r\n- Beautiful office in front of Lady Bird Lake that makes you proud of working here and makes it easier to come to work. The office building has a Starbucks, gym, is 30-seconds away from the lake trail, and has amazing views of downtown.", "cons": "- Your success is mostly out of your control and almost entirely dependent on your accounts/sales territory/manager: Reps who are working on deals and closing them \"found\" their deals because customers reached out to them saying they were interested in buying. Or because their field rep handed over the deal to them so the field doesn't have to do all the paperwork and approvals. Or because one or several of their accounts are adding a subsidiary and need to buy more licenses to stay compliant. Or because their territory has a lot of renewals and opportunities to do uplift or add more products to customers who just wanna buy more. Or because your manager has strong relationships at the field level and can get you included in deals and helps you with internal negotiations. You're effectively \"rolling the dice\" in this role every fiscal year. \r\n\r\n- Competition with field reps: if your field rep finds an opportunity in an account you share, he/she may leave you out of working that account altogether. The only way for you to work the account is if the field agrees to let you own the entire forecast of the deal, which likely they won't if a lot of money is on the line. If your deal is \"too big\", field management may take it away even if you found it. Why? Because they have the power of going onsite and leveraging the relationships they already have in those accounts (field reps don't get rotated every year as inside sales reps do). Most of the inside sales reps who do work with the field are simply pushing the paperwork for them. If you want to learn to actually sell, this role may not be for you. \r\n\r\n- Internal cannibalization: you may sell products that other reps at Oracle can also sell, which can get confusing/annoying for the customer. You may also sell a product that another pillar at Oracle also sells in another marketed version, so you'll be competing internally to see who gets to sell it to the customer. You also have a lot of reps from different pillars calling your same customer about different products, which creates a big mess. Imagine having business development, inside sales, and field reps from multiple lines of business at Oracle calling the same IT department in a company. \r\n\r\n- No work from home flexibility and average PTO plan: we brought this upon ourselves for having a relaxed culture, but work from home is almost nonexistent. The work from homes that do exist are \"awarded\" to reps during sales contests and are seldom. I don't personally see this as a con because having reps on the floor can be very useful when you have a question, but if you are used to having this flexibility than this job is not for you. Moreover, PTO is 14 days, and it is frowned upon to take it all at once. You may have to book them well in advance and spread them. \r\n\r\n- Hard to break away from established procedures or bureaucracy: obvious one for a big company, but still need to discuss this. Oracle has a lot of rules and procedures in place for you to even get a discount approved, or anything you need to help you win a deal versus a competitor or just to get the deal across the line. A lot of internal negotiations will delay or derail your deal. You will spend most of your day writing approvals to get a discount or some other requirement approved instead of prospecting or talking to customers. Then there is a lot of waiting.
