Everything I was told about the job, career opportunities and salary increases was a HUGE lie.  Oracle Direct Pre-Sales Consulting management is the industries worst led by C Griffin & J Hickman.  These old geysers should have retired 10 years ago.  Neither is qualified to manage a lemonade stand.  Their just fall in line do what your told management practices are from the 80's.  They provide zero value or leadership to the SC organization and care nothing about their employees.  They have no clue how to inspire, motivate or manage the SC's other than by intimidation tactics and false promises.  They continue to ask more and more from the SC's while giving nothing in return.  Pay raises are non-existent and if you ask for one you are labeled a troublemaker and will be dinged on your next bonuses and eventually pushed to the bottom of the heap.  Recognition and bonuses are given based on favoritism and whomever sucks up to them the most.  There is no possibility of promotion whatsoever.  Promotions are just a carrot they use to get you to do more and more but SC's have learned that they are being fooled.  The two year process to be promoted to principal has been made into an impossible feat that deters most from attempting.  Griffin and Hickman will never stand up to upper management and fight for their employees for anything.  Instead they are the henchmen that carry out Hurd's goal of cutting costs in the SC org and driving any good talent away.  They both are the definition of the word \"cheap\".   They deny expenses for SC's whilst they fly around the country staying at the best hotels.  SC's bust their tails daily doing the majority of the work on deals while inept reps and their regional managers get all the credit and compensation.   As for recognition a single SC is chosen from each hub as SC of the Quarter based totally on how much revenue the logged engagement activity against in their clunky system which is usually fraudulent to go up and get a 5 cent piece of paper that the secretary printed off the color printer moments before.  What an insult after busting your hump to help bring in a couple million in revenue that quarter.  If you're even luckier you may get your name called out during the quarterly SC Community Call by Carl Griffin.  Whoopee!!!  While our peers are receiving pay raises and promotions at other companies this is how we technical people at Oracle are compensated.  \"Complain?  Fine you can leave and we can hire an indian at half price\" is the general threat.  Hickman's idea of rewarding an SC for good work is by not firing them.  Griffin and Hickman do get raises despite their claims to the contrary.  This is the worst organization and management I have ever worked for.  Everyone is out for themselves and the only thing that matters is the bottom line not the workers.  We are now being forced to push the crappy Oracle cloud products onto customers who are smart enough not to want it.  Also if customers get cloud credits as part of a deal and the SC's can't get them to burn the credits down so Oracle can charge them more money our bonuses will be affected.  This is the latest threat!  I've been asked by sales reps and their managers countless times to lie to customers about what products can do and how much they need to buy.  I am always being forced to up-sell customers products they don't need or won't work.  Any SC that refuses risk not being utilized which means you won't be around long.  I can't even count the number of customers I have listened to get raped over the phone by Oracle licensing and support.   Software audits is used as an intimidation tactic to get the customers to buy more or as a punishment for not buying at all.  Reps are trained to submit customers who wont buy to the license team for audits.  Many customers have finally had enough and have fled Oracle.  If you are a technical person don't ever join Oracle PreSales.  Your career will die hard here and you will never use any of your skills and will likely forget those you have.  You will realize that because of no pay raises it costs you money to stay at Oracle."}, {"review_title": "Oracle Direct - OD", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Oracle Direct Sales Account Manager in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Easy M-F 8-5 hrs and low stress.

If you are extremely self sufficient then congratulations, but unfortunately majority of the new hires struggles for months.\r\n- Too people dependent. If you are considering a job in Oracle please make sure you get feedbacks about your manager and his/her manager. Rule of thumb: it they have not had more than 3-4 years experience in Oracle, and better yet- can demonstrate their progression in Oracle, you may have a very tough time getting the help and guidance you need. \r\n- The longer you stay, the lower your pay. By that I mean compare to  market rate.  Oracle has a \u201cno pay rise\u201d policy, so don\u2019t expect annual adjustment in accordance to inflation. Small % will be given if your manager knows how to write a lengthy justification for you, and once you receive that there will be quite a few years before you will be considered again. So over time you will be below the market rate. Hence my earlier point: find a good manager to work for - someone who knows what they are doing.\r\n- Attrition.

They waited until you arrived there so that you could not change your mind about working for them.\r\n\r\n2-Then they lied to me with my contract offering a different salary package lowering the bonus payment.\r\n\r\n3- Management and coaches are mostly Irish so they won\u00b4t be able to help you in your calls.\r\n\r\n4- Management has no clue at all of how the job is performed. You won\u00b4t be able to look for support on them because almost none of them is ready for his/her position. As an example, my manager doesn\u00b4t know anything about sales, Business Development and less about managing people. All of them just like walking around doing nothing all day, smiling and organizing silly which nobody cares about activities to expend the company\u00b4s money.\r\n\r\n5- The recruitment process is horrible. The on-boarding experience is null, finding yourself completely lost and not knowing how to set your systems. If you are unlucky and your teammates don\u00b4t help you then you will get frustrated and you will start hating the company. Of course your manager will have no clue of how to help and will not care at all.\r\n\r\n6- The training is given by people who don\u00b4t have a clue of what they are saying, you will not find it useful at all. This is the type of company who loves saying that they expend millions on training... guess what, not even the Account Managers know what the product looks like. You will be by your own for the rest of your period in the company.\r\n\r\n7- The company is infected with the worst cultural disease I have ever experienced, and notice the next, I have worked in horrible places before... People just don\u00b4t care about the company at all. From management to maintenance you will see as everyone just wants their money (they don\u00b4t even deliver in this aspect) and don\u00b4t care about the employee or customer. Nobody makes calls and it is supposed to be a sales role (if you don\u00b4t believe me just check around when you go to the office for the interview) so just imagine how careless people are about their job. Toxicity and negativity are being implemented on a daily basis by bad management decisions and actions since not even the director is ready to take his own role. Everyone will seem to hate their job and that is translated into a disease culture.\r\n\r\n8- Wait until you have to deal with your country\u2019s Account managers and fields, especially if you are in the Spanish and Portuguese markets. The company\u00b4s strategy and organization is probably the worse one I have ever seen. The Business Development area is separated from the Sales area (it depends on marketing) so there is no teamwork or common plan between both. Management, especially at a director\u2019s level think that they are so important and relevant by their own that they don\u00b4t communicate with sales. This will affect you super wrongly with your career path and with the main purpose of your role. The people in sales will not understand what you do or respect it so it will be super hard to achieve your target. We lost tons of opportunities because the Account manager just did not even care about what you said, or about calling the customer or whatever. Your manager will not care at all, your forecast will be done by blowing at the wind and checking how far dust flies, they probably don\u00b4t even know how to do a forecast.\r\n\r\n9- As said, nobody cares about the company, the worst part is that this happens at a European level. This translates into poor results which will reduce your bonus (because your bonus will not depend on how good you are but on a compensation plan based on the company results.) since nobody in Apps is selling anything. The overall quality of the sales people is extremely low and they don\u00b4t care about customers. Your daily job will be about fighting them so that they call the customers instead of what you are supposed to do. Oracle is a huge dinosaur which is being eaten by the competence (Salesforce, Workday, Google, Amazon, SAP, etc.). Everyone is here just to jump to one of those big names after a year or so.\r\n\r\n10- The company is a joke. They expend hundreds of thousands of euros in activities for which nobody cares (like sending 40 people to play a football tournament to France) and then takes away money from everyone\u2019s bonus without caring at all. The director sent a video 2 weeks later showing very little emotional intelligence and saying \u201cdon\u00b4t worry, this could happen again\u201d\u2026 just another joke.\r\n\r\n10- After all this you could expect that if you talk about this with respect with your manager and Director this issues could be addressed\u2026 Good luck mate!!! Because if you open your mouth you are doomed. We talked with the director and managers and they just did not care at all, the director was even defensive and aggressive about it. If you says something they will call you emotional and negative.\r\n\r\n11- Career progression\u2026 As it is not connected to sales department and they have problems hiring people and, everyone in your country knows about this issues, you will have a very hard time moving to the next position. The Recruiter will promise you that after a year you can easily move but is a lie, managers will not answer your calls, your director will try to keep you here as long as he can, they will freeze your position and even eliminate it after you were told to move\u2026 just a huge joke of a company, they lose all their good employees even before the first year of contract. Good thing that they won\u00b4t be able to retain you in Dublin for more than 3 months if they want you in your country, because they will try to retain you as much as possible.\r\n\r\n12- Political situation: Everyone in this company knows that everything is about creating a network by flattering and cheating. If you like doing so and do it well you will have an easier time. Since your work has cero value and no purpose at all you will have an easier time progressing if you love flattering than if you are smashing your targets. Politics is number one priority here, performance not. This explain the overall poor results. Dress super good and be ready for nice words, then expect the unexpected.\r\n\r\n13- Coaching\u2026 if you want to know anything about coaches just check at their CV. I have more experience myself than all coaches together and the worst part is that you need to be careful with them since they can put you in trouble if you don\u00b4t follow their directives. They will not speak your language so expect investing lots of time translating your calls into a word document with no purpose. They have no clue of what they are doing, an example of this is that one year ago the main priority was social selling (they did not want you to be calling around) and they did not teach people how to cold call so when the strategy was proven to be wrong the coaches don\u00b4t even know how to cold call and people was not ready to do so\u2026 nobody is still calling and nobody cares. They changed the way they were going to coach and instead of coaching new joiners (which should be common sense) they are going to coach now top performers, another incentive not to perform.\r\n\r\n14- Salary is quite low and variable is not even a thing. As they try to introduce new responsibilities they should consider increasing it but it doesn\u00b4t look like they want to.\r\n\r\nThere are probably a lot of things that I left out but I think that this was a good resume of the main points."}, {"review_title": "Decent enough - good benefits, great people and technology", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "11 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Engineering Manager in Reading, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Depending on where you work - great people and technology.

You can work from home.", "cons": "Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I have been with Oracle for over a decade. I write this to give potential candidates a real look into the company. Someone who has been with the company 6-24 months may not have a very wide view since you are required to stay in a position for a year and people rarely leave their area. I have worked in several different areas in my time at the company. I came on as part of an acquisition. Good Luck! \r\n\r\nTraining Development \u2013 In my over 10 years here, I have never witnessed any dedicated employee development. Part of management's job is to develop their employees, but that is completely non-existent. In the Global Business Units (GBU's) it's even worse. Oracle's latest \u201cemployee development\u201d program literally has employees filling out word docs about their goals and such. Basically what people did in 1999. As for actual training, for the courses someone might need to improve in their jobs or become more skills, Oracle will charge you thousands of dollars to take them. In my years here, I had one training course that my unit paid for. With the advent of the cloud, you are able to get access to subscription learning. These are setup as videos for the most part, so you're just watching powerpoint slides go by and once you're done, there's no real reinforcement. In my time here I have not watched one person be developed from a hire to employee to management. Usually in a decade you would have one or two examples of progression. \r\n\r\nManagement \u2013 There are many thick and useless layers of management. Many of them with very little technology and or real IT experience. When Oracle acquires smaller companies, if they are under the GBU framework, the company can basically say, a janitor is now a Senior Director and no questions are asked. I have watched scores of people come in that way and just leapfrog over people who have been in the unit for decades. It's even more embarrassing when the people who have been there basically know 10 times more about everything and the new member of management just sits around being social and not really contributing. I've also never seen the same members of management sit in the same exact positions for decades. These managers stay in office longer than presidents. Their attitudes are smug and many are downright hated by their team members. The thing is, you work in a tech company and you should know the buzz words or at least know what they mean. I have been in meetings where a director actually said to someone two levels below them that, \u201cthat's not their job to know how to do this or that...that's on you to know...\u201d At Oracle, as opposed to many other companies I have worked at, to be in management, you do not need to have been good at any one particular job or the jobs of your team. It is truly amazing. My thought is they stay because no companies really want them. \r\n\r\nSalaries & Raises \u2013 as many have mentioned here, the lowest in the industry. I have watched people get lied to about money, I have watched colleagues be sold one job and think they were getting their \u201clevel\u201d raise only for the manager to remove the job and create another job that was a lateral move. You are around some really scummy low down people. This is not like the big and successful tech companies. This is basically the lowest end of tech. With that being said, you need to do something remarkable to get any type of raise. You need to really beat everyone on your team and basically be perfect for 12 months. And even then, quite the stretch. Management that are friends with other managers will also have an impact on those things. I have gotten raises in my time here, but with salaries being so low, it's not a lot. As mentioned before, if you get in via an acquisition, you could get a nice bump from what you were making, but that's up for negotiation between Oracle and the old company. \r\n\r\nWork-Life Balance \u2013 The single reason I have heard anyone stays here is because they can work from home and get their work done in 4-5 hours a day. That's really the biggest benefit of the company and don't think anyone would argue. \r\n\r\nThe Cloud \u2013 applications on the cloud were deployed with very little strategy or education to the employees. They will never catch the other tech companies that are staffed with better talent and management. Management wants to tout the cloud as being a success, but it's basically because customers are basically strong-armed into going to it and they are flat out lied to when speaking about the overall performance of the cloud. There is also a mentality among management and long time employees that Oracle is better than Amazon. Anyone who knows the tech sector right now, knows that's laughable. At Oracle, they can't even speak about their competition because they're getting beaten so bad. What's worse is that there are smaller companies that are now coming up that have better products, better platforms, cheaper price and less problems."}, {"review_title": "Current Employee 10 years", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent benefits.

You can work from home.", "cons": "Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I have been with Oracle for over a decade. I write this to give potential candidates a real look into the company. Someone who has been with the company 6-24 months may not have a very wide view since you are required to stay in a position for a year and people rarely leave their area. I have worked in several different areas in my time at the company. I came on as part of an acquisition. Good Luck! \r\n\r\nTraining Development \u2013 In my over 10 years here, I have never witnessed any dedicated employee development. Part of management's job is to develop their employees, but that is completely non-existent. In the Global Business Units (GBU's) it's even worse. Oracle's latest \u201cemployee development\u201d program literally has employees filling out word docs about their goals and such. Basically what people did in 1999. As for actual training, for the courses someone might need to improve in their jobs or become more skills, Oracle will charge you thousands of dollars to take them. In my years here, I had one training course that my unit paid for. With the advent of the cloud, you are able to get access to subscription learning. These are setup as videos for the most part, so you're just watching powerpoint slides go by and once you're done, there's no real reinforcement. In my time here I have not watched one person be developed from a hire to employee to management. Usually in a decade you would have one or two examples of progression. \r\n\r\nManagement \u2013 There are many thick and useless layers of management. Many of them with very little technology and or real IT experience. When Oracle acquires smaller companies, if they are under the GBU framework, the company can basically say, a janitor is now a Senior Director and no questions are asked. I have watched scores of people come in that way and just leapfrog over people who have been in the unit for decades. It's even more embarrassing when the people who have been there basically know 10 times more about everything and the new member of management just sits around being social and not really contributing. I've also never seen the same members of management sit in the same exact positions for decades. These managers stay in office longer than presidents. Their attitudes are smug and many are downright hated by their team members. The thing is, you work in a tech company and you should know the buzz words or at least know what they mean. I have been in meetings where a director actually said to someone two levels below them that, \u201cthat's not their job to know how to do this or that...that's on you to know...\u201d At Oracle, as opposed to many other companies I have worked at, to be in management, you do not need to have been good at any one particular job or the jobs of your team. It is truly amazing. My thought is they stay because no companies really want them. \r\n\r\nSalaries & Raises \u2013 as many have mentioned here, the lowest in the industry. I have watched people get lied to about money, I have watched colleagues be sold one job and think they were getting their \u201clevel\u201d raise only for the manager to remove the job and create another job that was a lateral move. You are around some really scummy low down people. This is not like the big and successful tech companies. This is basically the lowest end of tech. With that being said, you need to do something remarkable to get any type of raise. You need to really beat everyone on your team and basically be perfect for 12 months. And even then, quite the stretch. Management that are friends with other managers will also have an impact on those things. I have gotten raises in my time here, but with salaries being so low, it's not a lot. As mentioned before, if you get in via an acquisition, you could get a nice bump from what you were making, but that's up for negotiation between Oracle and the old company. \r\n\r\nWork-Life Balance \u2013 The single reason I have heard anyone stays here is because they can work from home and get their work done in 4-5 hours a day. That's really the biggest benefit of the company and don't think anyone would argue. \r\n\r\nThe Cloud \u2013 applications on the cloud were deployed with very little strategy or education to the employees. They will never catch the other tech companies that are staffed with better talent and management. Management wants to tout the cloud as being a success, but it's basically because customers are basically strong-armed into going to it and they are flat out lied to when speaking about the overall performance of the cloud. There is also a mentality among management and long time employees that Oracle is better than Amazon. Anyone who knows the tech sector right now, knows that's laughable. At Oracle, they can't even speak about their competition because they're getting beaten so bad. What's worse is that there are smaller companies that are now coming up that have better products, better platforms, cheaper price and less problems."}, {"review_title": "Current Employee 10 years", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent benefits.

Most reps start at 50k base which is a joke. Directors and managers couldn't care less about the sales reps they oversee as far as professional development or providing any direction - there is no clear path to success or promotion. The KPI for success is to try to get a field rep or VP willing to share revenue on a deal they only achieved through the \"buddy wink wink, shake hands behind closed doors\" archaic sales model - who you know not what you do. When I started over a year and a half ago and was negotiating salary the manager responded with \"this is Oracle. Figure it out. We don't need to pay high salaries or invest in our employees. If you don't like it, go somewhere else. We'll find ten other reps willing to fill your shoes\". They don't even pay employees on time!!! I've been waiting over a year to receive a sales commission and still haven't received!!!! Not to mention in the middle of the fiscal year when I was about to close a deal, I received an email stating my comp plan is being adjusted and I have to sign it or I will not be employed or compensated (which is illegal and yes, they lowered the % of comp and on a side note, they are getting sued for this (amongst other matters) by hundreds of employees but have a full team of lawyers ready to delay delay delay the process in hopes people will just give up). Shocked how shady, slimy, devious and just shameless this company is as a whole. Last week they gave an award to an employee who was on leave for the entire quarter but on paper, they miraculously hit their number...that person wasn't even in the office or working! The manager pushed the customers orders through to help his/her own personal number, which shows how insignificant the sales reps role was - it was a \"sale\" but the customer had to buy because oracle forced the customers hand, riding the wave of Oracles previous stronghold on the database landscape. Good luck in the cloud!!! The Oracle name still carries weight though and has a good appearance to those on the outside. But what a fantastic facade they've pulled off. Kudos to their PR team and Oracle arena. Get candidates in there straight out of college, when they are young, naive, and have no basis for comparison. Work them to death so they leave on their own, don't pay them, then just hire more and more reps the next year to take their spots. They can't hire fast enough to keep up with their attrition! I obviously could write even more about the shady inner workings of this horrible excuse for a company but please just do your diligence - just ask current/former reps what their experience has been and I would bet my measly salary you will hear the same discontent. Nobody wants to share this though because if word really got out about the truth behind the flagship name, then it would threaten the one thing Oracle has going for it - the name/credibility on the resume when applying for jobs to get out."}, {"review_title": "storage engineer", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "4 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Support Engineer in Paris", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "reliable\r\nhappy to help\r\ndemonstrates empathy\r\nhappy to pickup new skills\r\nenthusiast\r\npositive attitude", "cons": "Some times I may be a little too perfectionist and so do some extra works.

If you're lucky, one of your few accounts may have a project and you may be able to compete for a win - I could confidently say that about 3/50 reps this happens to.\r\n(2) The actual BDG's in Oracle only really work the Field Sales team (as they sell to large org's and usually only large org's are interested in Oracle). So you don't have any leads coming in or any BDG's doing demgen on your accounts. This is your job as the Sales Rep/ Account Exec to get the leads and close deals - some love this. Many don't after they have exhausted all of their accounts and they have no more to create demgen on (so they need to wait for the next fiscal for new accounts or just keep trying the people that have said no).\r\n(3) As a Sales Rep in Oracle Dublin (UKIE market), your job is a glorified BDG - without the reward. You start with about 10 - 20 accounts, if you're lucky, your accounts might have buying authority in the UKIE, and you may be able to get a couple interested depending on how good your BD skills are. You will the spend the year working on that account, if you're lucky and are good at hard non-caring about the customer focused sales - you will close it in time, if not, the account will more than likely go to another Rep in the new financial year.\r\n(4) there is no team spirit, everyone has low moral, very negative, very gossipy (because everyone just gossip because they have nothing else to do in work).\r\n(5) the leaders and middle managers - from the likes of the VP's to the FLM's are completely incompetent. Most deals the managers get into, they ruin with their lack of knowledge, old-school sales tactics, and desperate measures to get just one sale.

No headcounts.\r\n- For an IT Company, it's very conservative.\r\n- For a global organization, it has American centrism with no understanding of how the world works or what is going on with other countries.\r\n- Also its very sales orientated & favors the sales teams in the company.\r\n- Oracle has grown too big for them to handle.\r\n- There is no work life balance in the company and has bad culture/values.\r\n- HR are the \u201csmiling assassins\u201d. They are only told what to do by management and will not listen or empathize with the employees.\r\n- No trust with high management or HR.\r\n- Huge Support layoffs around the world which will affect customer service in the future.\r\n- Knowledge of products have disappeared with employees leaving the company.\r\n- Unfortunately I would never recommend Oracle as it will suck the life out of you but if the above attracts you, I wish you luck with wanting to work for them. You will need it with plenty of patience."}, {"review_title": "It's all about cloud...", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "26 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Overall excellent technology.\r\n\r\nVery much a global company.\r\n\r\nSerious about the pivot to cloud, although starting from a position way behind others.", "cons": "The pivot to cloud is very disruptive to just about everything else internally.\r\n\r\nSales model shifting heavily to low cost inside sales and sales engineering, stretching sales engineering resources very thinly.\r\n\r\nCompensation increases are very difficult to obtain."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work for Technology enthusiast", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Project Leader in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Peers to learn from.
