Managers and senior level executives openly talk about career progression all the time. They want to help you succeed and learn new skills so you can grow. No other company I\u2019ve worked for has been like this. It\u2019s refreshing.

Everyone on the team contributes to our goals and has each other\u2019s backs. I\u2019ve never seen anyone ever get thrown under the bus. \r\n\r\nOracle is committed to diversity and inclusion, which I love. They also donate so much money to charity, their software helps with COVID-19 vaccine production, and they do so much for the world. They\u2019re not great about advertising it, so you may not be aware.\r\n\r\nOracle does genuinely value its employees. That spirit is infectious.

They don\u2019t read the question or statement in your email; they see a keyword and paste semi-relevant information into the body from an internal site.

It\u2019s extremely frustrating.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the timing of healthcare coverage is confusing when you join the company. Anyone you list on your insurance after you start has retroactive insurance beginning day one you started at Oracle. This means that there is no grace period to remove a spouse or child from another plan. You\u2019d need to cancel the other plan before you technically start at Oracle or the same day. At no point did anyone make this clear to me. As a result, I paid for insurance for the same person twice until the end of the year. It\u2019s important and worth mentioning to new hires.\r\n\r\nLastly, it can be difficult to initially get the tools you need to do your job. All new hires need to request their own access to all programs, sites, etc. The company is very do-it-yourself, which is fine. However, new hires need extra guidance. \u201cJust figure it out\u201d isn\u2019t very welcoming when you have no idea that there are instructions on a site called Confluence. I had to figure that out on my own.\r\n\r\nThe insurance provider\u2019s website is also misleading. It says things are 100% covered, but that can turn out not to be the case.
