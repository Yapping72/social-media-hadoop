This job is about how well you sell your work internally, not the results you achieve or impact you have on your audience. I've observed people do the bare minimum and spend 80% of their time on internal PR (this works!). Be prepared to work with 30+ cross functional partners on a project.\r\n- Culture: this varies greatly by team, but in my experience- many people have joined Meta for the comp and benefits, and are not aligned with the mission or direction leadership is taking the company. Many people are burned out and do the bare minimum to maintain their job security. The people who do raise their hands to take on extra work are not acknowledged or rewarded in review cycles. Instead they are seen as the go-to people for all the miscellaneous stuff. After a while, nobody volunteers to take on anything outside their job descriptions, because there is zero incentive to do so. \r\n- For a B2B marketing org, Meta is not very data-driven. Lack of SE/DE/analysts mean that it is very difficult to get internal dashboards built and maintained in a timely fashion. Everything has to be built from scratch at Meta, which results in very slow moving launches and launch results. Years away from being an agile marketing org.\r\n- Career growth: very slow and lots of ambiguity for how to get to the next level.

They will likely offer you everything you are looking for in terms of benefits and more. You will likely be taken care of in that way. \r\n\r\nNetworking\r\nThe layout and structure of the Meta buildings is set up in a way that you have the opportunity to run into just about anyone who works there. There are social events happening very often that give you the opportunity to meet people who you may not have ever worked with in your tenure and make meaningful connections.\r\n\r\nERGs/Clubs\r\nI strongly encourage getting involved with these internal organizations. Your success at this company will have a lot to do with who knows you and is therefore advocating for you during employee evaluations. These organizations will keep you sane and give you an outlet while providing some balance with your work.", "cons": "Not true autonomy\r\nI joined the company thinking that I was being hired to bring my unique talents to the table and it returns out that was not true. In my experience, the company wants more people like they already have that worked there. This bothered me a lot as I found it difficult to assimilate to the ways of thinking and reaching our organizational goals without trying something different which the organization was not willing to hear. \r\n\r\nLittle to NO work Life Balance\r\nThe company provides more amenities than any employee can use at any time. This is great if you have the time to use them. Most people eat, workout, play sports, play games, socialize, attend events, and network AT ALL WORK. And even when they are at home or on vacation they are still working to prove that they are dedicated to the company. There are many spoken rules to the access they have to you at this company, meaning that you will be at their disposal at any point they need you. If you are not, you will be punished. Not overtly, but certainly covertly. The company standards do not allow you to maintain healthy boundaries for yourself and I don\u2019t think it is their intent to do that either. \r\n\r\nDifficult Internal Mobility\r\nWhen I was hired, I was led to believe that internal mobility was easy. You can look up jobs available internally and talk to the folks hiring. Obviously, there is no guarantee that you will get the job that you want but you may have a slight advantage. Here, the company operates like many small companies within the same walls. There is no advantage. In fact, it may feel like you are under the microscope even more so coming from within the company. It is a weird and honestly icky feeling. I found this out when I wanted to do the same role in an adjacent department.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t Always Practice Values\r\nThe company\u2019s values have changed a bit to fit more of what the company wants from employees. Unfortunately, these values are weaponized from employee to employee. This makes the work environment hostile. If you say something to your manager, skip level manager, or coworker that they don\u2019t agree with or don\u2019t want to hear, the company\u2019s values may be used as a response to dismiss, demean, and invalidate your perspective in the conversation.
