Meta could do with A LOT less staff if they had any real leadership that required people to align and remove duplicative work.\n\nYour work is thrashed all the time because of lack of leadership and strategic thinking/planning. If you are lucky, half of what you do will make it to the finish line. This is a huge concern when going for your annual review because you are calibrated with others and depending on how your manager sells your work (or doesn\u2019t) will really affect your career and progression.\n\nMost executives still prioritize \u201cgiving people voice\u201d over addressing platform concerns and the negative impacts that the platforms can cause. They need to take issues more seriously.\n\nThere are A LOT of bad managers that can derail your career. Going to HR is useless because they are there to support the manager and limit risk to Meta. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I worked with that took paid mental health leave because of their bad manager. If you get a bad manager get out the team ASAP because it will take them at least 12 months to work them out once they have enough complaints and that is long enough for them to destroy your career.\n\nThere is no way for you to dispute your review. Some of my colleagues received a poor review from their manager but the review included inaccurate or false information (they had documentation to prove it), but there is no formal process to dispute your review. A bad review could cost you your career or make it difficult for you to switch teams.\n\nLeadership is leaving left and right which should raise some red flags. Metaverse is a big bet that will take years to pay off (if at all). How many people want to live in a virtual world? No thanks, I prefer to live in reality. Yes, there are benefits like training surgeons to do surgery before they touch a human but has anyone heard Mark mention using the metaverse that way?\n\nProduct managers are incentivized to get the products out the door, not to do the right thing."}, {"review_title": "It was great.
