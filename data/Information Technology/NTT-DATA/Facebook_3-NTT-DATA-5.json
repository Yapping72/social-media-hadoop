Digital Marketing team is a farce used to be led by someone who was very competent leader now it has been reduced down to operational work rather than any innovative initiatives coming out of the team. Spending so much of money and seeing the leads generated at the end of the month is laughable. NTT Corp Japan should wake up and make some changes, Indian-pure players are doing miracles with marketing teams smaller than this. \r\nWork form home is a benefit but the work hours go very late into the evenings. Late calls all the time and more over US team would schedule unnecessary calls just so that the Indian employees always attend the calls even though they contribute nothing in the calls. A true onsite driven company, offshore is just for the sake of doing menial jobs left over by the US team. Everything is top driven, would initially try and be innovative and try to change things, but no one ever cares they are more reactive and you will soon get used to that way of working. Not an innovative company at all, even when Dell Services was part of Dell, there is hardly any innovation. \r\nPeople who sit in the same office of the CMO and VPs of marketing are always preferred over the Indian colleagues. This is the first company I have seen with the worst NRI attitude, and also the first I have seen where an offshore role was taken onshore with CEO\u2019s approval. This kind of a thing is next to impossible in let\u2019s say Accenture, IBM or any of the Indian pure-player companies. Because of all this overhead cost the company grows at negligible rates year over year. If you value you career please stay away, very laid back culture it will cost your valuable career time and you will hardly would have done anything worth sharing."}, {"review_title": "Worst Employer in my 35 Years in Management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Jul 2020", "job_title": "Assistant Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supports Remote Work for Non-Salaried Employees", "cons": "In my experience: \r\n\r\nHires most non-professional staff as contractors to avoid paying benefits but does not provide a meaningful path to convert to NTTData employees.

Managers are given just the slightest amount of autonomy to award discretionary raises, promotions, and recognition to direct reports.

You can choose to become a part of the \"inner circle\" or clique of influential people that are empowered by the very top management of the organisation. Once you become a crony and be a part of the inner circle, then you can expect promotions every year despite the level of your (in)competence. Needless to say, when incompetence is promoted, competence moves away. Many of the old timers at this place appear to live in a make-believe bubble where they think they are part of a great team that is changing the business world or doing some brilliant, path-breaking work. The reality of it is something else(as described below). \r\nAnyone considering NTT DATA UK must evaluate this aspect as the favoritism at this place can have serious repercussions on your career path.\r\n\r\n2) Bodyshopping, not Consulting: NTT DATA UK tries to sell itself as a Consulting firm, however, almost all the projects here are IT Services or pure bodyshopping. This is evident by the fact that most of the lower grade \"consultants\" would be in IT project management. It was indeed strange to read that the CEO of this firm once spoke in an interview that he had never worked in IT, when the entire business is pure IT Services and body shopping. NTT DATA UK tries hard to leverage the NTT brand and its Japanese roots, along with the achievement of its sister companies, only to fall short in landing any worthwhile consulting projects. \r\n\r\nAnyone who wants to join this firm must be able to filter out the noise of consulting that will be sold to you, and be prepared to work on IT projects. \r\n\r\n3) Lack of competence in management: Owing to the fact that they tend to live in bubble and have only ever worked in IT projects, the middle and upper management possess a level of competence that does not match with the top tier consulting firms of the world. It was a shame to see some really talented youngsters being wasted away on body shopping projects. There is a serious lack of thought leadership because most of the published thought pieces are derivatives of the work from other consulting firms or sister concerns. There is a lack of opportunity to learn from senior management since they can only teach from the limited pool of knowledge or skill that they possess. Anyone considering to join NTT DATA UK must remember that you learn better when you are not the smartest person in the room. \r\n\r\n4) Sheer Toxicity: Although there are many social events to attend, there is a dearth of genuine and healthy camaraderie at NTT DATA UK. There is a persistent feeling of being under scrutiny all the time if you do not belong to the inner circle. The firm endeavors to present an exciting brand to the outer world by encouraging and coaxing employees to write glowing reviews on social media, especially Glassdoor and LinkedIn. As someone has written in an earlier review, I would strongly advise to read the positive reviews with a massive pinch of salt."}, {"review_title": "There are better consulting companies", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "15 Mar 2020", "job_title": "Senior Project/Program Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "None: Since NTT DATA purchased Dell Services, it's only a job and a paycheck", "cons": "- My last pay raise was two years ago\r\n- They use the Bell Curve to determine yearly bonuses.
