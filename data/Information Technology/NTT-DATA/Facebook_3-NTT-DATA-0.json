I left Big 4 because of the endless opportunities and engaging work I was promised here. I specifically said I did not want to do PM/PMO work because I felt my last firm siloed me into that and I was trying to get out of that and try new things. It was confirmed I would be able to do that here. Well within my first month of joining, I was told they had no projects in my vertical and was placed in a PMO Role on a client not even in my industry. During this time I continuously reached out and networked with people in my practice, engaged myself in various internal initiatives, and helped lead a pro bono volunteer project as well. The timing just did not match and so when a recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn, I had an initial phone call and things progressed from there. Keep in mind this entire time my practice still had no active engagements. \n\nMoving forward, I put in my notice and calculated my two weeks and put that date in my official letter of resignation. It was confirmed by my manager. Immediately after giving notice, the practice lead called me and was very accusatory and aggressive on the phone call. I was accused of not being engaged enough, being fed misinformation, and poked about where I was going next and who told me what (which felt like I was being asked to throw people under the bus). It was a very uncomfortable phone call and I was made to feel guilty for leaving. Fast forward 2 days and I receive a call from my manager indicating that since I am not staffed on a project they will be letting me go today with pay and benefits ending today as well. This leaves me over a week without pay and benefits which is highly inconvenient as well as just bad practice in my personal opinion. I had just paid my insurance premium on the last paycheck too and so thought I would have coverage until at least the end of the month...NOPE. And thanks for letting me know all this at 12 pm on my last day that I had ZERO say in. To preach that you care about your people and then turn around and do that after my last day of employment was previously agreed upon is pretty awful. I was completely blindsided and would've waited to put in my notice until later if I had known I would have a major lapse in coverage. It was extremely disappointing and upsetting to be treated this way and I did not want to burn any bridges but they have successfully done that themselves."}, {"review_title": "A good Company for
