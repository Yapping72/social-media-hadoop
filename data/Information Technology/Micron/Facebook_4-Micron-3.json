Unfortunately, these are rare at Micron.", "cons": "1. Micron is turning into Sandisk v. 2.0. There have been few internal promotions to executive levels since Sanjay took over, with most new blood coming from Sandisk and almost all are are non-American and have no clue about the culture in places like Idaho, Utah or Virginia; that culture is what made Micron a success and they're killing it.\r\n2. The executive team (the C-Suite execs in particular) are COMPLETELY disconnected from the operations of the company, seem unaware of the low morale they've created with the focus on their own wallets and power structures, and present a garbled, disjointed \"values\" system that is more marketing than a realistic plan to improve the soul of the company. For example, they espouse the value \"we care about our people\" while at the same time kicking team members out the back door.\r\n3. The new performance management scheme is a thinly veiled attempt to lay-off 10-15% of American workers every year for the next 5-7 years. While unspoken, it's become apparent that Sanjay and his team have no respect for American workers. Each year, 10-15% of workers will receive a failing performance grade, and while there's an alleged path to redemption, in actuality it's nearly impossible for those workers to meet the arbitrary and unrealistic expectations defined in their \"performance improvement plan\". And since everyone is graded on a bell curve, every year another group of workers will fall into the failing category and be fired. This rank-and-yank system has been shown over and over in studies dating back to the 1980's that it lowers morale, turns the job into a popularity contest, lowers efficiency, and just doesn't work. The fact that it's in use in 2019 shows a level of incompetence and ignorance from the executive team, and doesn't engender a lot of trust among the hard working team members who make them successful. I personally know of dozens of highly skilled workers who are no longer with the company because of this scheme. \r\n4. Continuing from #3, it's obvious that Micron is trying to get away with performing layoffs without having to report that material information to the SEC, shareholders, and other stakeholders. It's a legal requirement in the U.S. that all workforce reductions above a certain percentage must be reported.\r\n5. Expect to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including on vacations, holidays, while sick, etc. With all the terminations and resignations, and with no back-filling of those positions being allowed, each team is doing the same job with less and less labor. The inevitable result of this is going to be more failing performance evaluations and more firings. It's a vicious cycle that will see workers spending more and more hours on the job, never quite catching up to the work-load, being told they're failures, and morale will continue to decline. \r\n6. While you're expected to be on-call 24/7 and available by phone, remote connection or pager, the company doesn't provide equipment beyond a cheap 80's era pager with which to communicate (and even that's only 1 way communication). With 10+ billion in profit last year, the least the company could do is provide cheap smart phones for all team members who are expected to act 24/7 in the case of an emergency.\r\n7. The CEO is using the tax breaks provided in the new 2017 tax law to make $10B in stock buybacks. Even as market conditions deteriorate, the exec team is stubbornly sticking to the buyback plan. This goes completely against the alleged \"progressive\" values the company purports to support.\r\n8. Expect to have your \"priorities\" shifted on a regular basis, often while in the middle of a project that was top priority just 2 weeks ago. The company's strategic planning is non-existent, and often happens after the action period has already started. For example, it's March 2019, 6 months into the fiscal year, and upper management is still deciding how to execute on the (non-existent) strategic plan for the year. Also, everything is a top priority, which means nothing is really a priority, and this contributes to low morale and indecisiveness by team members and their departments.\r\n9. Departments often have objectives that conflict with other departments, and often those conflicts are resolved by whichever VP can yell the loudest or who knows the most powerful C-Suite exec. I've been in meetings where I spent an hour listening to VP's and Directors scream and cuss at each other, and I've even seen several people threatening violence. Those people are still with the company and leads to my next point:\r\n10. Many upper management and executive level leaders use a management style reminiscent of 1980's era thinking. Management by fear. Management by negativity. Management by impossible expectations. Management by dictate. Management by enforced cutthroat competitions among team members.\r\n11. The company is slowly shifting American workers to India - expect to train your replacement if your department is one of those being off-shored.\r\n12. The environment for a regular cubicle worker is terrible. The lighting is bad, people are packed in like sardines, the decor is drab, there's very little natural light, and overall it doesn't contribute to happy, healthy and productive workers.\r\n13. The mental health of a lot of workers is extremely compromised. Combine a poor physical work environment with cutthroat survival competitions, shifting priorities, opaque direction from the executive team, the fear of dropping into the bottom 15%, the hostility from management towards mid-management and front-line team members, and their are a lot of people in a really bad place mentally and emotionally. The company has offered mental health services to team members, but it's attacking the symptoms without touching the underlying root problems."}], [{"review_title": "Awesome Engineers, Head-Scratching Leadership", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Nov 2016", "job_title": "Storage Engineer in Longmont, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Competitive salaries, decent benefits, highly competent peers (not a lot of dead weight in my group), opportunities for lateral career moves that come with a large company.", "cons": "Leadership (at least in our org) seemed to have trouble committing to a roadmap and product to develop, and thus it felt like the rug was constantly being pulled out from under us and we were put in a position to fail time and time again.

While Micron is very subject to the economic cycles of the semiconductor industry and has laid off tons of people, they do want to do the right thing, it's not Silicon Valley after all but family-oriented Idaho.

Micron, as an extraordinary survivor in a tough business feels it has the formula for success down and has as much resistance to change built into every facet of its operation as any company I've ever seen. Actually, you feel here that you've entered a time warp, everything is early 80s from the sea of grey cubicles, to the management practices, to the strict 8-5 \"shift\" working hours, and even the smoking break rooms. There is some effort to \"pay for performance\" but the potential rewards are modest and, in any case, stingily doled out. If you have worked in technology other than at Micron and Idaho is not your dream destination you are going to be deeply shocked by the culture here. Still, tech culture is not all rosy and the tradeoffs at Micron are not all bad.

Some of these cons might apply to any semiconductor fab and not just to Micron's Virginia fab.  This is a fab environment, so everyone is expected to be on site by 8am.

For some people, there is also a daily tactical meeting where a representative from every team in the fab meets to discuss the issue.  There always seems to be too many meetings.  \r\n\r\nThis site is Micron's only wholly owned fab in the US.  It is has become a legacy fab and I don't expect there to be any new technologies to be coming to this site.\r\n\r\nThe culture seems to be focused on how much time you spend at work and not about results.  I think the strongest argument for this point of view is that one of the metrics for promotions is starting/ending times at the site for a 3 - 6 month period.  If the person about to be promoted didn't spend enough hours at work, their promotion would be delayed.\r\n\r\nThe last con I can think of is that this site is the only semiconductor site in the northern VA area.

Even though this process is typical, it is not easy because I was provided with no training.  \r\n\r\nBefore meeting with my supervisor to go over my performance review, I had to complete a \"360 review\" on her.  On Micron's website, you can find out that 360 reviews are shared with managers, but comments are anonymous.  No one told me this information - instead, I had to read it on the website.  I cautiously submitted the review with a lot of negative comments about my supervisor, because I didn't think I could refuse to submit it.  The review was actually sent directly (unfiltered) to my manager.  She couldn't see my name on it, but she knew who said which comments about her.  She didn't have a large number of employees, and she could easily figure it out.  Not many people in the company seemed to know that 360 reviews would be sent directly without any filtering, and from what I heard from my manager, people were upset.  After my manager received her 360 reviews, I noticed that she seemed even more moody than usual.  She also had not completed the performance reviews for her employees.  Before our meeting, but after receiving her 360 reviews, she told me she was still finishing my performance review.  Anyone should be able to see the problem with this and know where I am going next.  Well, during our meeting, she went over many negative comments that she wrote on my performance review.  Most of them related to my personality, not my performance.  Several of them were very nitpicky.  Before this meeting, she had praised my performance and never said anything negative about it.  The only thing she said that could be possibly be taken as a negative was that I could be a little bit clearer when stating my reasoning for positions I took.  We both had already agreed that I was responsive to this suggestion, so there wasn't much room to comment negatively on it during the review.  The final thing that made me know that she had read my 360 review and reacted to it in my performance review was that she said during our meeting that she knew which comments I made in my 360 review and asked why I hadn't brought them up before.  I was shocked that she would risk her job by admitting this to me.\r\n\r\nI complained to HR about this performance review, and they investigated it.  Amazingly, I was never told that they found evidence of retaliation, so I assume they believe there wasn't any.  They did tell me that they would talk to her about using the performance review in a more appropriate and productive way.
