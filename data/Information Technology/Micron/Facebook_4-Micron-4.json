For Boise the pay is very good.  A bit too much of the compensation is dependent upon the bonus and stock segments of the compensation.  If ALL you are looking for is money then its a good place to work.", "cons": "Workload,  HR policies, work environment, lack of internal job transfers, no work life balance. \r\n\r\nWorkload/HR Policies.  I can't speak for the new grads or junior engineers but as a senior/principal level engineer the work load and job demands are unsustainable. Management will put performance requirements on you so you have to work so many hours to keep up that you have no afterwork life.  Management pushes you hard by using the whip of the \"stacked ranking\" system. They say they don't have quotas but it is obvious they do. And when caught and sued they backed off a bit. But I suspect after the dust settles on the lawsuit over the ranking quotas they will go back to it with a vengeance.   \r\n\r\nWork environment.  With the ranking performance system I was beginning to see the fruits of that in that employees starting to cut corners, backstab other employees, and management playing employees against each other.  This makes for a miserable existence.  You are constantly looking over your shoulder and trying to give the illusion that you are happy and collaborating. \r\n\r\nIf you're and older employee or a long time Boise employee watch out. They are working to exterminate you.  Management sends a clear message that we only want young workers.  The whole Diversity and Inclusion thing does not include older more experienced workers.  Just a diverse new \"top tier\" new grad worker population.  \r\n\r\nThere are no careers at Micron. Just jobs. Lots of them.. if you are a young new grad. As a senior engineer there are very few opportunities for you to move around. It seems very difficult to move around because they only want to hire new grads thus shutting out seasoned and experienced senior level engineers from moving in a direction they would like their career to go. So you have to leave. \r\n\r\nIt pains me to say these things.  Micron had been good to me and my career for many many years. It was only around 2017/2018 that it took a turn for the worst.  It used to feel like family but not anymore.  You are just a piece of tooling that when you show the first signs of wear or break down they throw you away.  Heaven forbid you get ill and can't keep up."}, {"review_title": "Isolated and Outdated Management", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Feb 2010", "job_title": "Product Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Boise is a great place for families.\r\nOrg Structure is simple and easy to understand\r\nNot as political as other companies I have worked for.\r\nGenerous time off.", "cons": "Management tends to focus too much on hours worked vs what is accomplished.\r\nNot able to use the time off.\r\nWeak performance management.\r\nPay and benefits are below similar companies.\r\nNot many other employers in the area hire the same skill set."}, {"review_title": "good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a great place to work.

If you are young, inexperienced, fresh out of school, and desperate, this could be a springboard to a job at another company that you might actually like to work for. The CEO and upper management are not contributing to the overcrowding in Boise by actually bothering to move here and experiencing what used to make Micron special and and family oriented. Perfect place to work if you crave the absentee slumlord/landlord experience.", "cons": "Now for the bad news:\r\n1. Micron does not care about their people nearly as much as they want to promote the appearance of caring about their people. Rather than making appropriate resources and data available to their engineers, they insert extra levels of management that will not understand what you do, what you have contributed in the past, and what you can contribute to the company's future and bottom line. They firmly believe the fount of all managerial wisdom can be found in California alone, and indeed, built an altar to their beliefs there in order to not force their guru and his minions to relocate to Boise. The incredible disconnect between management decisions based on Silicon Valley dynamics and labor pool translate very poorly in an environment where quality of life is still important. California-based managers deliberately reduced all employees to numbers, forced a bell curve assessment model of performance that falsely changed employee rankings, subsequently depriving many not out of just their deserved bonuses, but their very jobs. These rankings were not based on actual performance, but on manipulated numbers highly influenced by politics. In an interesting note: managers were somehow exempt from this ranking system and its consequences, and a curiously large percentage of terminated employees were either older, higher paid, or both.This incredibly misjudged practice has resulted in many valuable employees finding themselves out on the street; many others rejected the management by fear techniques and moved on to greener pastures. Further exacerbating the problem, they have chosen to target still more older, experienced, coincidentally  higher paid employees by trying to get them to take a feeble \"early retirement\" package. It's pretty obvious at this point that catchy \"employees matter\" slogans cannot hide the fact that they actually don't.\r\n2. If you love having to produce a gourmet meal out of ice cubes and mint leaves, you have come to the right place. Micron has taken austerity measures to a new low, leaving folks scrambling for resources and expected to make decisions by the seat of their pants. Indeed, when the problems are brought up, you are rewarded with more micromanagement and fewer resources. Good luck with that.\r\n3. Lots of employee polls have been taken to see why people are unhappy. Clearly no one actually reads them, or management would not be so mystified. Perhaps employees have figured out that these \"anonymous\" questionnaires aren't so \"anonymous\" and can be traced back to them. Perhaps they expect to be told, again, \"If you don't like it, LEAVE!\" And yet management in California is flummoxed by the number of high quality people...leaving.\r\n4. Micron is Big Brother these days. Your every move is tracked, 500 of your best buddies are thrown into a loud \"bullpen\" where everyone knows your business, my business, and what their neighbor ate for breakfast. Even better: you are expected to partake of this invasive and utterly chaotic atmosphere 50-60+ hours a week. Hope you are an extrovert!\r\n5. If you are still reading this, you are a glutton for punishment. The amount of time you are expected to work definitely takes a toll on employees and their families. Good thing Micron has such excellent insurance and you can all get counseling...well, the employee can get counseling. Better have a good divorce attorney on retainer, though, because marriage counseling isn't covered! Is this hard on your relationship with your kids? Too bad, family counseling isn't covered, either. Better sock away extra money to buy their love.\r\n6. You had better always agree with whatever ignorant nonsense your boss spouts. If you don't, you are a target in those employee bell-curve rankings. Even better is the fact that if you have any problems with your boss, you can't expect help from their boss...and you can't try to change to another department, because then you are disloyal. Suck it up, Buttercup, and brown nose as though your job depends on it, because it does.\r\n7. If you loved school lunches as a child, brace yourself: lunches at Micron will not meet your exacting standards and will cost an order of magnitude greater than what they are worth. Take heart, though, for the fine establishments frequented by Ronald McDonald and the Burger King are nearby and provide far more quality fare.\r\n8. But wait! There's more! Your 60 hour workweek includes 40 hours of meetings every week, many of which run late into the evening because the engineers in Singapore don't want to get up early but are sure you love to stay late for the pleasure of their wisdom. Surely your job is secure and would never move offshore...\r\n9. Last, but not least, is the employee exercise program, where you are expected to hike two miles a day, come rain, sleet, Snowmageddon, or the blistering sun, just to get into your building and back to where you parked your car. After all, adequate parking costs money that is needed for management bonuses.\r\n10. Okay, so #9 wasn't the last one. When you give notice, Micron walks you off the premises like a mother in law who overstayed her welcome. You may or may not receive your paycheck within the time frame proscribed by law, and your exit interview will include much lamenting by HR that they hear everything that is wrong from each employee who leaves but are truly powerless to change things, because the fount of all wisdom in California does not care. \r\n\r\nSummary: The culture is toxic, the work environment hostile, and management is distant and incapable of learning from mistakes. If you take a job at Micron, travel light and keep your resume updated."}, {"review_title": "I'm responsible for all Capital Procurement activities in Assembly & Test area.

Ask for big pay, they have no choice, possibly they will accommodate you. \r\n\u2022\tThe new CEO has also came up with 7% layoff each year. If your manager wants to get rid of you, she/he will give you a low score, bing, you will need to go. Remember that there are no other opportunities in Boise other than Micron. For this reason, think really twice when you wana move to Idaho.\r\n\r\nCareer Opportunities:\r\n\u2022\tThere are literally fewer opportunities to move up in the company. It's heavily depends on \" like-ability\" not on your experience and qualifications. Experience and good team members\u2019 left/leaving the team after a Non-qualified team member was assigned as lead. Shocking ... I can see this behavior across the department. \r\n\r\nCompensations & Benefits:\r\n\u2022\tThe pay is less than industry average. Often said Boise is a cheap city, however it's not as cheap as said at all. Recent migration from other states to Idaho has made the cost of living pretty high, housing is pricy; off course cheaper than Bay Area.\r\n\u2022\tThe new CEO has cut the 6th month bonus from last year, though company has historic revenue last year.\r\n\u2022\tFrom this year, 4 of paid off days are removed from your flexible off time. The CEO office emailed us saying that \u201c to improve work-life balance\u201d. Can you believe it?\r\n\u2022\tThe new policy won\u2019t allow you to accumulate your leave for long time, you are forced to use them, or they will expire. I have heard from our international kids that this policy is hurting them a lot as they need long leave to travel and visit their family abroad. \r\n\r\nWork/Life Balance:\r\n\u2022\tThough you may carry R&D title, work in here is 24/7, you get Paged almost every night. You are expected to reply Pages within 2 hours; otherwise your Manager will be Paged. The new CEO has came up with the idea of 12 months cadence, meaning product cycle is decreased from 24 month to 12 months, without increasing team members numbers.\r\n\r\nSenior Management:\r\n\u2022\tYou will be shocked to see how poor the technical Leads and Managers are. They don't understand the technical details of your work, so won't appreciate it.\r\n\r\nCulture & Values:\r\n\u2022\tIf you are from top 50 US universities, you will be very alone here. Kids here are from schools you haven't heard of, or some cases with no formal education. I came across a former bar tender that was teaching Engineer kids about a semiconductor tool.\r\n\u2022\tCompany has a very poor and cheap culture. Engineers are treated like kids and often managers openly say that the main responsibility of an Engineer is to make lead/manager happy, that\u2019s it, and you guess the rest. Since you are in Idaho, you are treated like you haven\u2019t seen decent cities or never interacted with decent people.

I stayed there from 2005-2018, working on various roles from shift engineering, process, integration, quality with some reassignments at Boise, ID and Singapore ... my good experiences are summarized as follows:\r\n- good location for single individuals or young families. Manassas in general have the worst schools and crime in the area but the adjacent 'Linton Hall' and Fairfax districts have some of the best schools.\r\n- Proximity to Washington DC (less than an hour's drive by car). Its like living close to Paris or Rome if you were to ask me. Close to Shenandoah State Park (again, less than an hour's drive). Northern VA is good if you are into Civil War history. Drive up and down and you'll be in Pennsylvania (Amish, Gettsyburg), Maryland (National Aquarium, NASA), North Carolina (Duke Univ, beaches)... Manhattan/NYC is 6 hours' drive up north.\r\n- peers are generally nice, helpful and work really hard. \r\n- they send you to vendor training and will pay for your schooling as long as it fits your job role.\r\n- they support green card applications for foreign workers.\r\n- generous time off hours accumulation but whether or not they will approve your leave is another question.\r\n-good 401k match at 6%. Need 4 yrs to vest.\r\n- good training program like process classes, statistics. mentoring culture is terrible and likely non-existent in most groups.", "cons": "- salary is low if you would factor in the cost of living in the area. Northern VA is one of the most expensive in the US. $140,000/yr wont get you even a townhouse, which starts at $400,000. HOA's are another $250/mo. Of course there are cheaper options but pretty much you wont like it (1950's old brick houses in unsafe neighborhoods).\r\n- management will tell everything to motivate you but deliver way short after you did your part of the bargain. they say do this and that and we'll get you promoted ... after exceeding the requirements and after a few months later you are still engineer 1. Boss will say that you are 'almost there' except for 1-2 things you need to improve on ... then you get a fresh to do list and the cycle continues. There's an unwritten expectation of working 55 hours or so minimum if you want to be 'good in their eyes'.\r\n- promotion is not based on your performance alone. it is also based on how well you get the senior managers to like you. salesmanship and impression management will get you further than tangible accomplishment. quiet type engineers are at a disadvantage.\r\n- work-life balance does not exist unless you work on 3-4 day shift. it is pretty common for non-shift people to work 55-60 hours a week. If you have a meeting at 7-8pm, you still need to show up at 7:45 am the following day. You are required to be contactable even in the middle of the night, and you are expected to work at home thru remote PC connection - and this is not counted as 'work hours'.\r\n-yearly evaluations are based on how good you are compared to your peers ... you will be ranked against others. this made not a few people become selfish of how they do their work so as to be ranked better than others. if you are new, good luck figuring the ropes out.\r\n- cyclical layoffs. I survived 3-4 layoffs so far and this means more work for the remaining workforce. Everybody is overworked, resulting in consistent attrition of workers. Most of who stayed are either foreign workers waiting for their permanent residency, older 50+ workers, or rank and file operators and technicians.\r\n- most first level managers are chinese or indian so chances are youll have an asian boss  (again due to permanent residency issue, they have no choice but to stay). this would translate into a more asian style 'sweatshop' approach to management than the more liberal 'consensus based' american style we love. favoritism also play well at times in getting hot jobs i.e. expat assignments.\r\n- cafeteria food is terrible, not to mention the cubes are 1980's style light blue cloth with light brown steel frame and light gray cabinets. computers are slow but they change it every 6 years. i went to some offsite training before and i was handed over an old heavy laptop and corded mouse for use. i volunteered to use mine instead and just accessed my work PC remotely. \r\n- Parking is insufficient. Need to come early to secure a good spot.\r\n- No gym.\r\n\r\nBottomline: workers are not well taken cared of based on their treatment and their general workplace.

Fortune 500 company and being a place people want to come and work is very low on their priority list, they just want to catch Samsung. I was aboard the Micron ship, until they were ready to drop you and your entire department in the drop of a hat to send you to a contractor with shitty benefits and no vacation, no sick leave, and no night shift differential. They (management) could have searched jobs within the company and did direct transfers of our department across the board to other positions within. Instead, they once again took the cheap way out and sent everyone of us to this crappy contractor that no one wants to work for with a horrible reputation (Securitas Security Services, read about them on here too). Micron, I hope to hell these selfish decisions come back to bite you in the ass, BIG TIME. I can't wait, I just want to be a fly on the wall when all your good knowledgeable employees leave and all you have left to turn to is a revolving door of crackheads with no common sense and no work ethic and the longest job they've held is about a month or two, try to run your security department. Get ready, your ship is about to sink and good riddance to a bunch of cheap, no good selfish, spineless bastards.

MT's are now very few with generally double the workload they started with, but very very minimal increase in pay. No one knows how much work came actually correctly completed in one 12 hour shift. It seems like a strange strategy for cost cutting. Employee headcount goes down to bare bones causing their workload to increase even more, which leads to greater risk to the product and lower tool efficiency. Does eliminating low end low paying jobs save enough money to offset scrapped wafers and loss of tool production time? Even when you consider these employees are doing double duty for essentially the same pay rate?  Wouldn't retaining low cost labor instead provide an opportunity for a better distribution of work which could easily translate to less human scrap and less lost production time for tool malfunctions?\nLast, it doesn't matter how hard you work, how much you know, how well you document your development, if you ask for additional responsibilities or for development opportunities to benefit your performance.
