this company is not about innovation, engagement, growth or giving back. They are a group of middle age white guys in North Carolina who are honestly not even human on the inside. China makes the stuff, and these honkies peddle it with flip flop morals, not caring if there are known manufacturing defects, they want to sell it and get rid of it, and will deal with the known defective machines when the time comes. In the 2 Years that I have worked for Lenovo, I never experienced an earnest 1 on 1 conversation with my former manager in the K-12 hybrid business. I never received a single hello what is good in life, how are you and your family, what motivates you and makes you happy, what are you into, what do you want to learn and grow into here.. type of questions. Every single day and week starts off with multiple unhappy low quality bottom feeding catfish like partners who Lenovo desperately relies on to make ends meet. These reseller partners employ highly rude, aggressive, low quality, and extremely unpleasant Account Managers who sell into your assigned accounts. These partners include scum like \"CDW\" etc who bark at you like a dog, day in and day out, and as soon as you provide the services they request, they are trained to immediately throw the pricing, quotes, solutions, and information back in your face as if you wronged them, and they ask for price cuts, twisting the knife, and your fate.. throwing tantrums over email, and ultimately screwing with your paycheck and livelihood when they eventually cry to your superiors that they don't take home the full pot and leave you pennies to fight for. Once the morning email complaints are sludged through, you will then usually get a bombardment of invites and spam calls from other not so related colleagues who are onboarded with the role to harass the inside and field sales teams for how you can help them peddle more filler services. A few hours rolls by and your boss emails your team a breakdown of everyone's performance for the month and it is usually just a reminder to keep generating more for him, more more more. Internal financial reporting tools are archaic and understanding where you are at each week or month is nearly impossible, as partners refuse to report sales, so come end of month you are scrambling to account for credit on deals that Lenovo was paid on already but you have yet to receive credit for to keep the lights on at home.\r\nEach months victories of high dollar deals that have closed are paraded in weekly calls to brag about big numbers, but that very same director will not say thank you to you personally or acknowledge you. As soon as the 1st of the month hits, you are back to being a worthless zero, and the mentality once again switches to \"Load the pipeline and tell us exactly what you are making for us this month\" There is zero training or mentorship, and you can only smile like an idiot and accept their crappy water bottle and notepad gifts for so long. If you ever need assistance with physically impaired health related difficulty such as bad vision or hearing and request a larger monitor screen, or sound device.. your manager will laugh at you as if it is an outrageous request.

The campus is nice, there are some decent managers and co-workers who you can rely on to be team players.", "cons": "Work quickly piles on you year after year while your salary slips behind industry average. You typically will earn a maximum 3% merit increase, and that's in good years. Instead, you are dependent on bonuses to make up the chunk of salary that doesn't keep up with inflation. Management totes this as a huge carrot to go after, but in reality, few truly benefit from it, starting at band 10 (the highest non-executive pay grade) and rising exponentially through the executive bands. This is why the rank-and-file are pushed so hard to produce those quarterly results -- so executives can get theirs. \r\n\r\nJob growth is non-existent. Those who tirelessly self-promote will succeed here while hard working team players will be pushed to the wayside and given more work to do without even a word of thanks or praise. Lenovo is rife with politics and nepotism and it has caused the culture and morale of the company to decline steadily over the past several years. This also leads into the ubiquitous sport of bullying by the favored members of staff and management, and the highly subjective annual evaluations that management gives you. \r\n\r\nWorkload is usually unreasonable to start with, and you are expected to pick up any slack left behind if someone is laid off or a contractor is not renewed. Expect many late night work sessions and meetings with people overseas. Weekend work is also common if you're in engineering. Don't complain about working 12+ hour days for months on end, sacrificing health and family time to meet deadlines, because it will be met with biting criticism about how much you cost the company, and that you can be replaced with two engineers from China. Also, complaining about bullying will get you nowhere other than to be called \"sensitive\" or a \"snowflake\" and will put you further out of favor. You're expected to take it on the chin and not complain about being put down for your background, appearance, or life choices from someone who \"out-ranks\" you. It's like you've joined a fraternity filled with ignorant trust-fund types who have only seen privilege and entitlement their whole life and anyone who doesn't fit their ideals is wrong.\r\n\r\nHR knows about all of this and does absolutely nothing, other than to offer a perfunctory effort at \"culture change\", which usually dovetails into their only self-perceived pillar of strength: \"diversity\". I've heard endless spiels about how inclusive Lenovo is along with vague statistics of how women, minorities, and members of the lavender community are \"doing great things\", all to make Lenovo seem like it's in touch with the workforce of the 21st century. In reality, it's yet another distraction to keep employees thinking the grass is perfectly green where it is and to avoid taking issue with the real problems plaguing the company. The message here is, if you can become the poster child for something, even if it's completely superficial, you'll go reasonably far here. Shiny, loud, and new is valued much more than competent, quiet, and experienced. \r\n\r\nDuring Covid, it was proven that working from home kept the company going strong, but after things relaxed, it was strongly suggested, then demanded, that we return to campus. It became clear pretty quickly that this was due to Lenovo's \"Look at me!\" visibility culture, and that truthfully, the company can function just fine without layers upon layers of management whose only job was to attend meetings and to be seen around the office just to be seen. On top of that, the disingenuous buzzword-filled, game-show host personas of most in managers trying to put a positive spin on absolutely everything, including when people are laid off, is nothing short of nauseating. \r\n\r\nThis leads me into my last point, and that is the constant threat of layoffs. Every year, even in good years -- where the company is literally setting record profits, layoffs happen, usually 2-3 times a year. Curiously enough, it's not always the lowest performing people that are let go. Many times, it's the ones who aren't in the right cliques and who aren't friends with people above the director level. Indeed, many laid off are over the age of 45 since that's when the cost of covering a family's health insurance starts to really look bad on the company spreadsheets. If (when) those laid off need to be replaced, it is done with someone overseas or someone in the US that is much younger, costing the company less to employ that person or, in some cases, people. Quality of work ultimately suffers, but being a publicly-traded company, it's only the next quarter's results that matter in the end."}, {"review_title": "Means well", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Senior Account Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pragmatic.

Every time you need to do something your supervisor needs to know details which I found not very different from anywhere else and not a positive point. \r\n3- Politics is more important than knowledge, if you know who to be friends with, you are set!\r\n4- Teams are separated in different cities of different countries. Which means 24/7 notifications and virtual meetings. It is very difficult to have product related discussions on the phone, especially if your native language is not English.\r\n5- manager and senior-level are not always the people with experience and knowledge that you might think. I have seen more than one instance that the person in charge of the project did not even understand fully what the project and its limitations were! \r\n6-No documentation exists of simple things that people did or tried. Neither anything for environment setup. Makes everything take forever and gives you lots of anxiety to accomplish something.\r\n7- It is not very nice in my view to tell people we had a great quarter and everything is good as we were on top of the Covid and moved production to other locations, just to get your layoff letter next week! what kind of policy is that?!\r\n8-I have read this in the comments and thought maybe that was just some people's experience and I will be different. So, I am mentioning this point knowing that if you get an offer, there is a good chance you will accept. However, you have to understand that if you see 50+ people in the orientation (taking place twice per month) it means they layoff with some similar numbers too. Trust me they are not expanding like that during Covid."}, {"review_title": "As INTERNAL SALES PROMOTERS", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "30 May 2021", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Developing commication skills and problem solving skills also", "cons": "Try to finding customer satisfaction"}, {"review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Product Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Big company with solid process", "cons": "moving slowly towards competition though"}, {"review_title": "Amazing", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best management.
