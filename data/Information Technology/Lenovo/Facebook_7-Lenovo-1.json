This is true in both the US and especially in China.\r\n\r\nWhile you are treated with respect, you are still very much a bar code in the grand scheme of things.  HR partners cover hundreds of people and are generally unavailable to anyone under the Director level, and have piles of paperwork.  In 5+ years at the company I've had maybe 5-10 minutes of face time with HR, most of which took place during the interview process.  Time spent at the company is not valued, and you are no more/less valuable to the company than someone who can do your job and just walked in off the street.  I've also had serious issues that have gone ignored for almost a year.\r\n\r\nThe company is somewhat disorganized, processes are not optimized or even followed in some cases, and the solution to bottlenecks is usually to hire more people instead of solving the underlying issues, which just complicates things further.  \r\n\r\nIt seems like Lenovo would rather hire 10 people for $10k/year that make millions of dollars worth of mistakes than spend $100k on hiring 1 person who makes minimal mistakes, can actually handle the job they are assigned, and could save the company millions. This is especially true in China where average salaries are lower and there are more positions to fill.\r\n\r\nFinally, while Lenovo has plenty of strategies and resources devoted to developing and implementing them, there is frequently no cohesion between organizations.  Different units/teams/etc. have conflicting KPIs and despite everyone having the same over-arching goals, no one is unified or aligned on how to achieve them.  The strategies themselves usually lack a concrete \"how\".  It's a lot of talk about vague \"enhance this\" or \"improve that\", with no mention of how this is going to happen.  At the end of the day the strategies just become words on paper."}, {"review_title": "Great practice ground for carreer starters", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Internal Sales Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Lots of freedom on how you approach customers. \r\n- Every deal is totally yours.

This makes some sense during acquisitions or expanding product lines, but eventually needs to centralize again on things like standard services to customers, which software and systems are in use globally (except for China; literally worldwide = worldwide - China for various initiatives, policies, standards).  Often you would find different groups effectively \"competing\" against each other with similar initiatives, or with unclear expectations as each brand believes they are \"priority one,\" or will go off to build another silo'd solution (why would anyone EVER fund such things?) while Sr. Mgmt. doesn't produce a top-down cohesive plan or vision - compounding this sort of issue further, costing money and time, and diluting customer experience along with internal effectiveness.\r\n\r\nReliance on IBM at any cost \r\nIBM obviously had the better lawyers in various agreements, to the point they make it nearly as expensive, or moreso, to move away from many long standing agreements with them.  Everyone knows the high relative costs there, but when new initiatives come up not covered by existing IBM agreements, inevitably some will try to push IBM as a solution provider, instead of looking into more cost effective and efficient options.  The reliance on IBM increases Lenovo's cost of doing business, which they decide to counter via random layoffs vs. smart business.  You also might be wise to point out the obvious inconsistencies and costs of partnering w/IBM, depending who you may be speaking with.  \r\n\r\nWork/life balance\r\nWe get it, we're a global company, but there are ways to schedule meetings that limit the recurring evening (US time) meetings to 1-2 nights/week, instead dog perpetual ad-hoc until you realize you have several hours of meetings every night of the week, on top of your normal work days.  \r\n\r\nManagement\r\nThis may well have some dependency on where you work, and for whom.  Some Directors are solid, along with some Executive Directors, but often there's a never-ending cycle of \"emergencies\" that really aren't, often times created by some managing upwards/brown-nosing far more than considering team capacity, dwindling levels of motivation, or in some cases, putting personal \"achievements\" and reputation over the best interests of the company and team.  Throw in random initiatives that shouldn't exist at all coming in from China or other groups, and the possibility for chaos is fairly high until upper management sets a solid top-down vision and clear responsibilities across the company, IT and other teams."}, {"review_title": "Great for internationals, poor culture", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Mar 2018", "job_title": "Senior Product Manager in Beijing, Beijing", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Large company and experienced workers, great support for expats.\r\nBroad portfolio of good products,\r\nGood package", "cons": "Difficult to make impact due to same-as-last-year culture\r\nPolitics are cutthroat at senior management level, negatively impacting business decisions, sometimes severely so"}, {"review_title": "A $35 billion startup.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "13 May 2018", "job_title": "Channel Account Manager in Raleigh, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The review title refers to a phrase I used to hear from time to time at Lenovo, used to describe the experience of working there.

This can obviously help the more nimble startup culture by providing capital and infrastructure, but it hindered Lenovo sometimes too, via bureaucracy and commitments to legacy systems.\r\n\r\nLenovo's employees are warm and helpful. They are smart and most care about the company in a real way. I worked with many professionals whom I respect and that is one of the best parts of working there.\r\n\r\nIn sales, one had considerable leeway to run things in one's territory as one saw fit. Management was open to new ideas and I implemented some of my own. Some failed, some succeeded;  the openness to new ideas is a testament to Lenovo's culture.\r\n\r\nI am grateful to Lenovo and for the time I worked there. My experience there is defined by the fact that I didn't have extensive work history at the time of my hire; and working at Lenovo was my first experience working for a large corporation. Lenovo hired me soon after I graduated college and was open to taking a chance, which I'll never forget. I adapted well to the life of working at a large company. \r\n\r\nIf you've worked at other companies and/or are coming in with a long resume, your mileage may vary.

There were just some annoying limits of being a contractor.\r\n\r\nLenovo consistently paid a little bit less across most jobs where I learned the salary against the industry. Pay can be a touchy subject for management but the fact is that not only was I miffed about my own pay towards the end of my stint; but competent, creative and innovative coworkers consistently left to take higher-paying jobs elsewhere. \r\n\r\nSpeaking strictly regarding my time there there were manufacturing delays that put our shipping times well behind industry average. This was around the IBM x86 acquisition and year after it. It went on a long time. Global technology supply chains are incredibly complex. However, I think that considering that we faced serious problems for well over a year to the point that large sales were canceled and returned combined with the fact that Lenovo had many people whose expertise was global supply chains working on supply chains they themselves built, I think it's appropriate to criticize poor performance here. This was a political issue in my time. I have only my own observation that it was ongoing for a very long time and rumors I heard that certain senior managers were intransigent to change. Some had to be forged out to fix the problem, but this took a long time.

The sales team (at least the area that I was in), was respected and treated like we mattered. \r\n\r\nAbout 1-2 years after I started working there, there were some major changes to the organizational structure and two of the sales divisions were blended and that's when it all went downhill. In my 3.5 years at Lenovo I have literally had about 7 different managers and I have covered about 4-5 different territories. During this time I was \"lucky\" if I made my number. How could I actually work to make my number when I wasn't even in a territory long enough to remember the names of my account book's CIO's? (Luckily SOMEONE realized this was why reps were not making their number). We are treated as if we are completely dispensable and we are now being replaced by contractors who are underpaid and do not get anywhere near what a regular rep gets in commission. This I'm sure has a positive effect on the bottom line but a very negative effect on the workers. Not only the contractors who are not being treated fairly (and were lied to about the potential of their positions before being hired) but also the regulars who are becoming more of a financial liability instead of an asset.\r\n\r\nManagers are hired based on who they have grown close to or what they could be holding over Lenovo's head (ie, possible HR issues). They preach about how they want to write big checks and reward overachievers, but when you overachieve they start raising your quota so that you don't achieve more than they want to pay you for and then if they allow you to \"blow it out\", they'll cap you in the end. Then the next qtr they double your quota so that you don't blow it out again or better yet not make your number at all so that they will reap the benefits of your revenue without having to pay you a dime for it. Either way Lenovo is going to try to get their money back. And then they wonder why reps sandbag...we have to be just as underhanded as management just to get a paycheck!  \r\n\r\nDue to layoffs we have lost all of our resources and EVERYTHING lands on our laps and the inside team barely has a chance to prospect. We have ridiculous metrics, where we not only get to be so overworked that the majority of us are working at night and on the weekends but we also have to put in writing what we are doing. So we get to do and journal our work day. We are micromanaged and treated like little children who need to be kept on a short leash.\r\n\r\nMost of the managers' main focus is \"make me look good in front of my boss\" instead of \"let me help you look good in front of my boss\". Some of the team managers were horrible floor reps that either barely made their number and/or was on plan (about to be \"reassigned\" for poor performance) the qtr before they were promoted. How can I respect a manager that can't even manage their own territory?? What can they offer me that they couldn't even offer themselves? Lenovo has become a complete joke to work for and NO ONE is happy with the exception of a few of the lazy managers and execs who are reaping the benefits of the sales reps daily stresses without lifting a finger to assist. Everyone is just waiting for the economy to fully recover so that we can all hightail it out of there.\r\n\r\nOh and can we please get rid of the IBM Legacy processes???

As a side effect from the IBM business, the major functional groups tend to be very silo'd; a case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.\r\n\r\nMany managers tend to micromanage to the point of suffocation, or being overly strict about enforcing policies. On the other hand, some managers tend to be so far removed from their employees that they don't see each other for months. There is little happy medium in management, so pick your poison.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, they do not value internal talent and have little long-term focus around their people.

Lenovo almost always hires externally to fulfill its needs. The obsession with directional change mentioned by many other reviewers here is true, and when that occurs, many of these new hires find themselves responsible for a position not even close to what they were hired on for just a year or even six months prior. This definite is a sign of a company that does not have an actionable nor sustainable long-term vision. Of course, this is what senior management is responsible for and has failed to deliver on much of the time since the acquisition from IBM in 2005.\r\n\r\nSenior management is obsessed with changing direction as a response to failing to meet goals that were unrealistic to begin with. During my tenure at Lenovo, I saw a culture of 'yes men' as opposed to any real leadership. I say 'yes-men', because the vast majority of \"leaders\" are male. While there are some females in management, the majority of them are in lower-to-middle management.\r\n\r\nLenovo's culture is also quite toxic. Bullying, negative gossip, and ostracization is frequent. This is actually encouraged by management with what they term \"visibility.\" Indeed, it is more important to be seen and heard by the right people than actually do an excellent job and help your team or division succeed. If you can argue your way out of a poor job performance or blame someone else convincingly, it is believed. Many have learned to game this culture and work their way up the ladder. Some are moderately competent in their roles, whilst many lack even the fundamental skills necessary to succeed. The way around this is to either:\r\n\r\n1) Pull rank and say \"I know better because I'm a higher band\" and then ultimately blame the impending failure  on something else, or\r\n\r\n2) use your internal connections to find a way around the person who is in a lower band to push your agenda forward and explain it in such a way that people in senior management (who have no clue as to what's going on besides how much money is being made and spent) to agree with you and take your side.  \r\n\r\nI have seen many well designed plans thrown out the window in favor of ludicrously complex designs because of political posturing and power-plays. This, of course, makes it significantly harder for the people actually doing the work to successfully complete the requirements, so the answer to that is to have them work 12 hour days and weekends for weeks or months at a time.  A VP I used to work for heard about how hard our team was working for months on end and his response to this was \"I don't care, as long as it gets done.\" If you complain about being worked to death, you WILL be made fun of publicly by someone who out-ranks you and finds this type of humor acceptable. This workload isn't an exception to the rule, this is how it is 70% of the time at Lenovo. \r\n\r\nLayoffs occur multiple times a year and have for many years now. Management leverages globalization as an argument to tell you that you don't deserve job growth, a shot at a promotion, or to be paid better despite those of us that pushed through the hard times, make our respective teams succeed and have a significantly larger workload than many people at higher bands have.  Several people in my role or similar have been told that management can get two engineers from China or India for the same amount of money we are being paid at Lenovo. While there is some truth to this, I would ask how this is a motivating factor to get me to work even harder at a company that puts more and more responsibility on its current workers and gives a 3% raise for the lucky ones, while external hires have more visibility, less responsibility, and generally a 10%-20% larger paycheck. \r\n\r\nSadly, Lenovo is not one team. It is many internal divisions competing against one another for funding, indeed, survival. Divisions use one another to meet quotas, get ahead, or finish a product, then have to convince upper management how much they did themselves. The ironic thing is, many of these divisions are so interdependent so by trying to make one another look bad, this form of \"leadership\" is only really hurting the company as a whole. The only other companies I have seen use this model is organised crime.\r\n\r\nLenovo also uses a bell-curve rating to force their employees into categories of 1, 2, or 3; 1 being excellent and rare to achieve; 2 being the norm for many hard working, competent people (2+ being higher on the 2 scale, 2- being lower, but not quite 3), and 3 for people who aren't doing their job, or more to the point, people that management does not like. Since bonuses are a large percentage of employees' salary, we are forced to compete against one another for the '2' positions. The '1' ratings are reserved for people with more visibility and who are favored, generally quite subjectively, by management.  As an added bonus, this is a zero-sum rating system. For every 1, there must be a 3, for every 2+, there must be a 2-. This, again, forces people to work together in the short term, but then people that want to make a career here will not think twice about stabbing their co-workers in the back to get ahead."}, {"review_title": "Pluses and Minuses.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "21 Aug 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Morrisville, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits package.

All big companies have bad pockets, but this team has surely been the most corrupt and politically-diluted that I have ever worked on.\r\nApproximately two months ago, we received new org charts and official announcements that there were people promoted into positions that were never posted or opened for applications. Sadly, this won\u2019t be the first time I have seen blatant unfairness in my time at the company and in this department. After being personally solicited for meaningful charitable contributions by upper management, we had one person make quite a large donation that was not anonymous (it was listed by their name on the charity website) and they have been promoted 2x in less than a year. So if these are the paths to success, hard work will get you nowhere at this company. Be prepared to donate or brown nose your way to the team of favorites because that is the only way that you can succeed here. Hard work is not recognized, only favorites and folks who chose to play the awful game of politics. \r\nThe recent organizational promotions, which were confirmed by HR to not be official, indicate that there is zero regard for fairness and they are even openly ok with being unfair. It is not fair to the employees who may wish to apply and get an opportunity to obtain the position, and it is not fair to myself and my teammates who may have missed an opportunity to have more qualified management. \r\nAlso, there should be no surprises that the same rules do not apply to everyone. We have plenty of folks who heavily abuse the vacation policy and experience no consequences. Maybe you will be lucky and be one of those folks, but I have worked every day I have taken PTO, and also some holidays, only to sit back and watch those who abuse the system get rewarded. \r\nWe also have folks who do not adhere to a professional dress code but suffer no consequences. All the while, we have repeatedly had high school speeches on dress code. It seems the folks who do these things get away with it while everyone else pays the price.\r\nThis is not an ethical place to work and honestly, I believe that some of the actions that myself and my teammates have experienced are not even legal.\r\nI would advise to stay away from Lenovo if you have values and would like a fair place to work. I believe there are some good pockets at the company, but I have no located them yet.

If you are willing to burn yourself out for the sake of little money, this is the company for you.

Many times people just ignore those message because over time it has become too overwhelmed to handle. \r\n\r\nSalespeople are battling with building pipeline, but the management just throws questions on how much you can bring in every week without contributing help or suggesting new ideas to improve/or make things work. If you try to voice out your opinion/suggestions, you will be easily shut down. Because all they really care about is numbers. They won't open up their mind to accept changes or suggestions. That is why the process here is NON EXISTENCE. Honestly, many people who came in the first week, they instantly know that this company has no process. If you try to tell your manager to improve a certain process, it's almost impossible. They will admit to you this company has no process. It's a dead end. It's no wonder this company never succeed.

Although it hasn't been made public yet, by the time this post is approved, the world will know that Lenovo just cut another big chunk (about 300 people) of the U.S. workforce and will send most of that operation to China. This comes in yet another hasty reaction to a slowed financial forecast in the enterprise space and the fact that we moved far too slow in the smartphone and tablet space.\r\n\r\nThis company knows very little about real innovation, despite the ubiquitous \"DO+\" rhetoric that can be seen around campus... China wants everything for nothing, and doesn't understand that much of the world is realizing that quality and value is better than cheap and \"good enough.\" This attitude will be this company's undoing.\r\n\r\nLenovo has been following and not leading for too long and trying to play catch up year after year. We, in the U.S., constantly have to prove ourselves to our Chinese leaders, despite achieving more than them with fewer people. We must work with colleagues from China but be careful on how we collaborate with them, since they will take our ideas and the credit for them in an instant, leaving our KPIs in the red and our jobs at risk. \r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no job growth here outside of China. I have seen so many new faces in the past few years hire in at higher bands than ever before. People at the lower bands work hard, struggle, then get fed up and leave. If you aren't part of the good ole boys club from IBM, you aren't going anywhere, and your job is at greater risk.If you can't keep up with the constant change of strategy and org charts, you will most likely be cut during the next layoff.

These employees are seeing post-Lenovo pay bumps of 20%-30% because Lenovo is simply not keeping up with the market.\r\n\r\nLenovo has also discontinued all training for US employees and offers no form of internal development or advancement. At least, for individuals below the executive level. Executives are doing just fine (they all spent a week together in 5-star accommodations in Barcelona this October). Promotions are a thing of the past, as all new job openings are filled by external applicants- oftentimes before existing employees are aware of the opportunity. I will repeat- Lenovo does NOT promote internally. Management also repeatedly changes direction, which has resulted in the lowest morale and worst work life balance I've ever seen at any company. Employees are all scared to voice their opinions because history shows that those with opinions will be next in line on the chopping block.

I often wonder if they even read resumes or care about the results of the interview. When contractors are hired they have 1 interview that takes 15 minutes. It truly shows the company doesn't value their employees. They also don't train the new hires well at all, usually 1-2 months. All fo this leads to a very bad culture. The management constantly has to micro manage and treat the ISR's like highschoolers. \r\n\r\nThe company doesn't value their senior rep's or full-time employees very much either. The overall vibe amongst employees is very negative. You can hear people all over the sales floor complaining about the managers, tools, and company non-stop which brings down moral constantly. \r\n\r\nConstantly understaffed. No training. NO professional development. Unreasonable expectations. \r\n\r\nThe next biggest issue is the sales tools they have. They are horrible. The average \"sales\" rep, AKA Admin, will spend 75% of their day dealing with issues in SAP CRM. They support teams are understaffed and there is very little help if you need it. It is a pure nightmare for all the reps. Most people stay long enough to gain just enough experience to get a job elsewhere. Worst of all, Management doesn't care. They will hire another contractor to replace you. They also won't fix the tools, processors, or hire more people to support sales. \r\n\r\nAnother big issue is the commissions and reporting. You will NEVER know how well you are doing because the company constantly makes errors in reporting and provides you with very little insight. You basically have to watch you numbers carefully and call out all the mistakes they make. Its also a known fact amongst vets that you will typically only pay rep's for 50% of the services they sell; and you may only get credit for half of those.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best advice I can give is stay away if you are already have experence or want to hit the streets selling.

Managers and project managers usually disappear in the early afternoon and every engineer manages to make their projects right all by themselves, from project managements, cross-function negotiations and defect rejection. No one is doing their job. If anything goes wrong, and yes, under these conditions most of the things wouldn't go right, managers would pop out of nowhere then start to arrange some kind of \"reviewing meeting\" with old senior engineers or architects who I think the last time they are actually coding was decade ago,  in their words: \"Try to help engineers out\", by pounding engineers for their lacking of progress, teaching engineers what to do, in a very elementary and a outdated way, to us it is more like farmers tells engineers how to make products, no trusts whatsoever. After the meetings, they fade away again, waiting for another review meeting.\r\n\r\nFor the product itself? No one respects the industrial standards, nobody cares about professions, always tells new comers not to innovate, even when those innovations are just making things easier. Telling new comers just to follow the old design for the maximum compatibility, even when the old products are usually made based on the wrong concepts, never passes some basic criteria. There are several times hardcore conflicts occurred with the industrial standards running on the market, no one seems really care, they are more happy making work-around or stays as it is then fixing the actual root causes.\r\n\r\nFor innovation, any innovation proposal would've been disposed one way or another, managers and old breeds never take responsibilities on anything, innovation has risks and the unknowns, they don't like risks and new things. So new comers end up two way: to leave, or to become one of the deadwood.\r\n\r\nThere are constantly lay-offs, but always the new comers or the hard workers, because of the one-way KPI, new comers always get lower grades than the ones who makes coffee for hours or sticks on the internet looking for new cars, the ones the managers loves the most gets the higher KPI rate, they are usually the old ones who make tasty coffee. For those who gets the lower KPI grades, covers most of the workload.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, applying credit card and VISA as a item of KPI, true stuff. What a joke!
