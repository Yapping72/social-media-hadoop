They have pretty standard dental, medical, vision, 401k, parental leave, and PTO. One perk is unlimited sick days. Their employee equity plan has relatively no strings attached. The one downside is that they partner with an obscure company out of the UK. Customer service is poor, and their investor portal has a lackluster UI.\r\n\r\nThe people are nice, and everyone is well-adjusted to remote work. They don't mind kids or dogs in the background of virtual meetings. A perk (at least for me) is that SAP does not require video during virtual meetings. There's sort of an unspoken rule not to use video. I personally enjoy it. I can dress comfortably, and I'm not distracted about how I look on camera.\r\n\r\nNorth American leadership is very community minded. When tragedy strikes, they respond. They've created relief programs for natural disaster victims. After George Floyd was killed, they hosted multiple All Hands sessions and diversity education sessions. They testified in front of Congress. Even now that Black Lives Matter isn't making headlines, they continue to promote minority causes and small businesses. They are not afraid to \"get political.\" One of SAP's core values is inclusion, and North American leadership works hard to foster that. SAP in principle is a progressive, equal opportunity employer. For example, they had training about non-binary individuals before it became \"mainstream.\" They also have an Autism at Work program.\r\n\r\nIt's very possible that you'll work with people who are all over the world. It can be very rewarding (and something to brag about).\r\n\r\nThe North American offices are LEED certified, which means they pass stringent environmental standards.", "cons": "Right now, the SAP I love looks very different. From my perspective, global leadership's attitude has been essentially, \"Shut up and do what I say.\" They don't understand or care about how our internal processes work. They've forced us to roll out solutions that aren't ready for customers, or solutions that customers don't even want. In order to meet their deadlines, we have to implement complex manual workarounds to get the job halfway finished. To be fair to current global leadership, SAP's processes were complicated before. Unfortunately, selling has always been the primary goal. We have a poor track record of actually delivering quality service. But the current pressures we're facing are making things worse. Add all of the COVID complications, and now you have a place that really isn't fun to work.\r\n\r\nThough SAP's pledge of inclusion is admirable, it is not always practiced. Hiring practices can be elitist. To be frank, leadership is primarily white men and high caste Indian men. Our current Board is all white, mostly German, and only has one woman (there will be two when 2021 starts).

Key focus has been, and is, to deliver value for SAP\u2019s customers (internal and external). From smaller enhancements to reimagining entirely new business processes, SAP brings some of the smartest people in the industry together to drive and solve tomorrow\u2019s technology innovations. Knowing that a majority of the world\u2019s economic activities are processed on SAP systems, and seamlessly connecting producers of goods with consumers, makes us proud. Knowing that many of our technologies and financial contributions are used to help and better the life\u2019s of less fortunate world citizens, shows commitment to purpose and heart.\r\n\r\nSAP\u2019s management solicits and uses employee feedback in its daily business practices resulting in an environment of trust, respect, and genuine practice of \u201cemployees are the most valuable asset\u201d. Being part of the SAP family means, one never runs out of options to further develop, learn, grow, and take advantage of opportunities. There are thousands of colleagues that are ready to support, be it for business mentorship, a personal challenge, or simply to have a friendly competition of encouraging fitness tracking as part of work-life balance and a healthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\nSAP has generous benefits and pay \u2013 which is only one part of the equation. The boundless opportunities, with learning opportunities, advice and mentorship \u2013 as well as the ability to work with and learn from top international industry talent is a priceless experience not many companies can match.

Find a good mentor and be prepared to work in a \u201cteam work\u201d approach. \r\n\r\nWhile working remote might be acceptable, working closer to an official office location may also help with establishing those relationships (though most leadership is distributed throughout the world, as in many global companies). \r\n\r\nSAP being an European company, the treatment of employees is very fair and considerate (maybe more so than many US companies) yet they are not immune to continuous changes in the industry, which leads to organizational enhancements from time to time (for the most part not reductions, yet changes in managers or teams).

No progression at all through the position. There is a very high turn over rate because of the issues above\n\nThey lack experience due to the fact that they do not want to promote their employees for the work they do and people eventually leave...these people (if replaced )are replaced but college graduates which starts the cycle. They come in, train up, get good at the job and are doing the job of a senior engineer and don't get paid fairly, get burned out due to stress and workload, they leave.

Example:  An ex-CIO or Big 4 MD wanting to move back into the more tech side or services orgs from Advisory.\n- Cloud strategy and cloud-readiness is still lacking\n- Partner strategy should look to cloud and more products than HANA.   HANA products should focus more on top cloud services and position as solutions(ie. HANA integration w/IIoT data intensive solutions as well as analytics & ML services) as well as SAP solutions for faster and greater Time -to-value (TTV) for partners and clients (this helps all succeed)\n- Need to integrate across all SAP tech more.\n- Real strategy & change on services esp. with partners which can drive exponential growth and not just re-positioning and marketing what we have.    When working with partners need to want to succeed thru & with them not as an avenue to sell your product or services.  Use a reseller for that.\n- Too many cooks problem....to get something done, everyone comes out of the woodwork wanting to be in meetings but never wanting to do the work or own the issues and challenges just the rewards.  This is a huge delay in accomplishing things.\n- No real sales, marketing, product and growth strategy.  Just words and no execution.  Sales is transactional \"hoping\" to resell to existing customers.  No real bus dev & expansion.  Lots of gatekeeping with the excuse that a mistake was made several years ago.\n- Ageism is a beast here and it is discrimination.  \"I want younger\", \"I want older\".

It gives the employees room to grow and gives them wonderful extra time to help your family cope with any troubles in life. SAP also tries to fulfill best in employment salary and bonus structures.", "cons": "While SAP as a company offers great benefits, the problem is within the Product Support division.  People who may apply for Support engineering role should look elsewhere due to the reasons below.\n\nIn Product Support there are two main tasks (i.e. could be inhumane too), that is so tough that it requires you or forces you to work nights and weekends.\n\nI) First task: Man the Expert Chat Channel.  Why is this so tough? First there is not a lot of people who may help here (or it adds a lot more work to your daily requirements). If you somehow walk away to go to the bathroom or you are helping other customers online, there would be a flag or an alarm to management that there is nobody manning the chat (Or you are not manning the chat).  This makes employees start to feel anxious to the point that SAP Product Support becomes a very stressful environment (i.e. unhealthy). \n\n- If going to the bathroom gives an employee stress then this is simply a requirement that is inhumane (HR issue)\n- This makes employees very stress to the point that they may quit the company (which happens a lot in SAP)\n- Turn over is pretty big\n- This task also adds to the overwhelming number of requirements that the support engineer needs to do daily\n- This is also going to be recorded in a report that is available to management - how long did you logon to Chat?  They can use this number against you.\n\nFor example: If the support engineer needs to help 5 different customers daily with their issues technically that may last 1 to 2 hours each (in a web session call or deep dive session), this chat (i.e. you may get between 1 to 3+ per day) will add another 30 min to 2 hours each on top of the already scheduled 5 customers (10+ hours).  This will either push other important customers aside for the next day (lower customer satisfaction) or would make the support engineer work beyond normal working hours to fulfill the requirement.  SAP is wondering why they are not getting high scores in Customer Satisfaction, it could be that the process they placed could be stressing their employees to be the best they could be.\n\nIf you do this daily, you would have tired and highly stressed support engineers which will then be burned out. This may show up in our customer satisfaction results as your engineers are not fully rested and can only give 5 minutes to each new customers (i.e. ping pong effect).\n\n II) Second Task: You are also required to work nights and weekends (Saturday and Sunday).  This is one of the hardest one that is given to any support engineer.  Yes they may ask you to take some other days off or may even give you money but it also takes away the most important thing a person needs and that is time with family and time to recharge oneself.  We can argue that the chat + weekend support makes an engineers life hard.  Wait til you miss a call or work during the weekend, this is where you would feel what hell is like at work.\n\nThese 2 tasks from product support is one of the most challenging thing to swallow (your mindset needs to be a zombie).  If given the opportunity to work for another company or division in SAP that do not have these requirement, I would say sign me up immediately!\n\nLast issue is as soon as you get to a particular level, there is no more growth.  You have maxed out.  Your contained within your level per budget limitation.  \n\nIf you can work in SAP in another division, that is good. Within Product Support, it is tough."}], [{"review_title": "Great place to work!
