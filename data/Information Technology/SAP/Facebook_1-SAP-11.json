towards the end of the probation period - they come up to the employee, stating that he/she failed to reach the targets during his/her employment and they aren't sure whether they want to confirm him/her as a permanent employee, blaming it all on the employee and on his /her performance, although the employee is trying his / her best to accomplish his/her goals: a few days later , the managers fire the employee on the spot.\r\n\r\n- As a matter of fact,  there are some other reasons behind a firing during the probation period: in my case, for instance, the manager noticed (after more or less 1 month of employment) that one of the team members (who had been in the company for more than 10 years) and who was supposed to take care of my whole training really disliked me and was very often mad at me, although I was trying as hard as I could to abide by their rules and to follow the trainings.\r\n\r\n- The reason why this person disliked me so much was actually related - in my opinion - to my unusual skills to speak several languages (indeed I ended up - quite by chance - in a project where all of the languages which I've been studying in the past 10 years were spoken, so this colleague was clearly envying me and was behaving exactly this way (complaining about me with the manager, stating that I wasn't paying enough attention to the trainings etc)\r\n\r\n- To assume that someone is unfit for an entry level position (I had colleagues, whose job experience at SAP was their very first one, indeed they were part-time employees, studying at the university) sounds quite suspicious, considering that I had worked for 2 years previously in similar customer service positions in other companies and I never really had issues with the work itself: it's the kind of job which can be done basically by anyone, who has basic IT skills and basic language skills.\r\n\r\n- The job itself consisted in calling the customers in order to remind them to pay for their invoices: a few days before firing me, the manager was trying to convince me that I had some mental disorder or cognitive deficit, keeping me from performing the job, which was actually an extremely easy job.\r\n\r\n- The manager said also - though - that he believed in my potential and would have helped me find another position in the same company:  I applied for about 25- 30 internal positions after getting fired, but none of my applications was successful though, so I spent 3 months unemployed and short of money, before receiving another job offer from another company.\r\n\r\n- Obviously the manager told the other team members to behave exactly like the colleague who was bullying me all the time: they all wanted to make me believe that I - as a matter of fact - was unfit for the job and really deserved to get fired.\r\n\r\n- During my first month of employment - indeed - only this colleague seemed to have something against me but, after some time, all of the employees (who were the manager's accomplices )  who at the very beginning used to have a friendly or neutral behavior towards me started being very strict on me , being very picky about every single (real or assumed) mistake from my side.\r\n\r\n- After spending a few years in some multinational corporations, I actually realized that - every time the managers notice  there's a conflict between two employees in the same project, they usually don't  bother explaining the most arrogant and senior colleague that maybe he/she's wrong to have a certain behavior towards a new joiner (they find it awkward, how can you contradict some senior colleague, who has been in the company for such a long time?), they'd rather make these 2 colleagues work in 2 different projects or - the way it happened to me, to fire one of the two employees (usually the new joiner), so that they won't have any chance to meet and work together again.\r\n\r\n- Most of the times - though - it's not that easy for an employee to find another suitable position in the same company , because the entry level positions aren't open all the time and most of the times only the senior positions are open and some employees might not fulfill the requirements for such positions.\r\n\r\n- To sum it all up:  the manager(s) wanted to hire me and they chose me among other candidates: however, after realizing - 20/30 days after my starting date, that one of the senior colleagues really hated me, the manager asked the other team members (who really had nothing against me) to be as critical and strict on me as this senior colleague was, to make this person's behavior look like \"normal\" and shared by the other ones, in order for the manager to be able eventually  to fire me for a pretextual reason."}, {"review_title": "So far, So Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Partner Service Advisor in Montreal, QC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good willingness to change and improve culture.\r\nOpenness from both execs and management.\r\nGenuinely good colleagues with good commitment to deliver for both internal and external stakeholders.", "cons": "Numerous acquisitions have created significant disconnect between different parts of the organization. --> doesn't feel like 1 company.\r\n\"Classic\" German process mindset still prevails in many areas.\r\nDepending on your work area, there might be a lack of opportunity (especially as a recent graduate)."}, {"review_title": "Local vs HQ skew", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Feb 2020", "job_title": "Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The ERP leader that is in transformation to a more intelligent portfolio", "cons": "Value creation is just lip-service.

Oldest employees are the worse cancer for the subsidiary. Resistance to change, comes directly from them, as they're the less prepared for the business shift all SAP's acquisitions mean and demand, as the company moves from selling only ERP, to selling business-impacting value.\r\n\r\n2) Many sales and support-areas managers are not really skilled to execute their jobs. The biggest personal assets there are your abilities to socialize with the senior management, and integrate to the \"core power group\". It's amazing to see some of their profiles and find some directors have almost no previous valuable experience!\r\n\r\n3) No strategy in place whatsoever. Even in the toughest industries, sales quotas are determined by a local \"board of directors\", that have no clue of the true opportunity the market has to offer and that is right in front of their noses. Amazing.\r\n\r\n4) Lots of useless global organizations, full of useless people. Globals know that many subsidiaries are a \"mess\", so they stick to travel and doing presentations, but don't really get involved. \"Business development\" areas in between the sales teams and the valuable technical areas, are also not adding a lot of value, especially when they're composed of people from different nationalities, who lack a proper way to engage with customers from specific regions like LATAM.\r\n\r\n5) All of the above has created a subisiary that works, above everything else, ruled by a very strong \"law of the minimum effort\". People knows things won't change, so they don't even bother. Most of the people that has been there for more than 5 years, want to be promoted just because directors really do nothing (even when they do a lot of effort to appear to be \"tirelessly working). Lots of long meetings, events, and so on, but with very little to no value for the customers at all.\r\n\r\n6) Focus over the industries where SAP has been successful locally in the past.

It sounded like a terrible joke and this is when they lost me.\r\n\r\nFor a company that takes pride and says it rarely lays off employees, employees get laid off on a regular basis without any reason whatsoever communicated to them. \"You've been simplified\" is the horrible euphemism going around for layoffs. High performers included... Does performance mean anything at SAP? In my 8+ years with the company, I have never seen the commitment and morale so low and everyone with their heads down as in my last year and this is probably going on. Raises are small or not offered even for high performers. Not sure how people execute and meet customer expectations to \"run simple\". The truth is everyone is running scared and this is heavily impacting every single area of the business let alone the ability to deliver to customers. Employees whose jobs are \"redundant\" are being laid off instead of getting trained and encouraged to move into \"growth\" areas. At the same time there are thousands of job roles in the careers portal. This is anything but simple. HR are so disconnected from the people of SAP.
