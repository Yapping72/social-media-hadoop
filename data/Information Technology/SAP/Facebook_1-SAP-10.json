I worked weekends and vacations just to keep up because of either unrealistic expectations or dealing with the added time required to work through the red tape that is required to do one's job.  Every vacation request was challenged by my manager even though I had earned the time off, and I painfully recollect times when I was staring out at the ocean from my hotel room while I was on a mandatory conference call.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was just the team that I was on, but I found management to be aloof and clique-ish.

Communication with managers is terrible. It is never an open forum. When you bring up examples of something \u2013 they will ask \u2018who said that\u2019 or ask for specific names. So there\u2019s a lot of finger pointing and blaming. The lack of communication is comical at times. Every bit of information I learned about when people are being hired, when people are moving to other departments, any changes at all has been from a colleague. Sounds like a rumor mill because it is. And it isn't that they are waiting to finalize things, we just never hear anything from management. Silence.\r\n\r\nRole/Promotions: Roles work in whatever way allows management to favor who they want while not paying people for the work they do. Promotions are based on an arbitrary and subjective list of attributes of the employee, but even if you \u201ccheck all the boxes\u201d promotions are seemingly only possible once a year so be prepared to be told month after month that you will be promoted in the coming months until an entire year goes by.  Moving from help desk to PMO support should be a title change \u2013 its\u2019 different work, more difficult, deserving of a pay change. It is incredibly frustrating doing the exact same work as a colleague but knowing they have a different title and are being paid more for their work. If the managers really love you, (meaning that you have completely bought into their terrible management style and decided to take on that approach), they might create a role just for you and never actually hold interviews or make public that a new role has been created. The favoritism is out of control. They have also invented new roles, basically getting people to do the managements dirty work, and asked application specialists and analysts to take it on. Again, no title change and no raise. Just way more work and responsibility. Skill and experience are not rewarded here. Ever. When other people responded negatively to this new role, management repeatedly claimed it was what we had asked for in a survey given out. In reality, we had asked that our managers be more available. They basically did the opposite by putting more people between us and them. \r\n\r\nGaslighting:  Management blames productivity on the people left in a department that is clearly understaffed and often employs gaslighting to get their employees to comply. \r\nIf you messed up and have an understaffed department don't make your employees feel like they are to blame for not doing enough. They are always working hard. How about thanking them in a genuine way? Maybe even apologizing when management messes up? Do you really want to be a manager using a tactic for psychological abuse on your employees? Probably not.\r\n\r\nManagement Style (or lack thereof): When starting, there is a sink or swim attitude. If you don\u2019t pick it up on your own and exceed without any help, then you fail. There are hardly any resources for anyone who is failing besides being reprimanded. Their attempts at improving morale are embarrassing and as soon as they see any major issues going away they return to their same ways, which have proven time and again to be very very bad. They operate on a 'putting out fires' mentality. There is no forward thinking, no planning ahead. Management has made it seem like they don\u2019t have time for meetings. And then they get mad when their employees don\u2019t go to them with concerns or struggles. If you make yourself unapproachable and continually have a bad attitude, you cannot expect people to go out of their way to seek guidance from you.  Management loves to ask rhetorical questions in meetings. It is a way to belittle staff. The relationship between manager/ employee is not professional.\r\n\r\nShifts: Management did not make it enough of a priority to inform applicants of the possible shifts they will work. Instead, they make vague statements when asked if we will work a typical work week. Honesty isn't really their thing. Instead, they lie and then treat their employees like children who weren't listening when they explained how it all works. If you end up with a \u201cswing shift\u201d you are treated as though that assignment was a deserved punishment that you need to earn your way from in order to get a day shift. People who started at the same time as you will have your desired shift from the start, not having earned it in any capacity. \r\n\r\nSexism: It was difficult to imagine my career growing within the support department because management was almost entirely made up of men.  Any efforts made to provide opportunities for socializing and bonding within the department were based around male-dominated interests and activities such as shooting and fantasy sports leagues. There was no effort to come up with activities that would be inclusive of all interests or at least have a variety of activities covering many interests. Outside of support, men in higher up positions continuously creep on younger women. The environment of the company allows them to keep doing it."}, {"review_title": "Amazing company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Software Development Consultant in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- SAP cares for its employees.

Sales \"leaders\"/task-masters spend way too much time grilling AE's on every last piece of detail which again, actually slows down sales execution. This focus originates from a BIG lack of trust in sales; think extreme paranoia multiplied by a ten thousand. Every week AE's have to fill out an excel to say where they've been, who've they've met etc.... treating seasoned sales guys like first year inside sales graduates does not wash. \n- Chaotic middle-management: huge void in leadership skills across the board. \n- Hugh attrition: in little over a year nearly my whole team has left, with the bulk of people leaving on their own accord, simply to escape the toxic culture.

Directors lead MDRs on; whom are more than overqualified, been with the company for multiple years and proven themselves worthy of leadership roles; to think that they have a chance at the roles opening up within the MDR department and then hire externally or in different departments because again, they have no respect for MDRs as career professionals, with one exception, a 23year old that they gave a manager position too because one of the directors had a personal relationship with that MDR. \r\n** Note: Management just handed that MDR  the management position without considering any other prospects or making it available to any applicants** \r\n- - It's also been discussed that employees applying for internal roles outside of the department have been sabotaged by directors approaching the hiring department telling them not to hire that MDR because they are a top performer and want them to sit in the department and make them more money till they're burned out and leave - - \r\n:: Also, there's a \"rule\" that you have to sit in seat in the Market Development department for at least 1 year before being eligible to move throughout the company. No this is not in your job contract or discussed throughout the interview process you find this out after you're hired and are stuck. ::\r\n\r\n>> Now to discuss the job itself... You are a telemarketer that can be replaced and rotated out. There is no strategy, you do not create relationships with your Sales Execs because you have 25-40 that you support. You used to strategically work with 4 Sales Execs and support their specific territories going after top accounts and helping them bring in quality customers. They changed this process because of the massive turnover they're seeing in the department and now the sales pipeline won't skip a beat with MDRs constantly leaving.\r\nYou have call center metrics you have to meet every day and if you don't meet them you are interrogated on the reasons why you didn't meet them that day. The micromanaging is absolutely out of control, there's no faith in you that you are a professional that can do your job and run your business properly. This job requires no relationship building just endlessly calling prospects to see if they have 10min to learn about Concur and passing off anyone who says yes to the Sales Exec assigned too the account then getting back on the phones to find another prospect to say yes. \r\n\r\n::: Warning: DO NOT TAKE A SMALL BUSINESS POSITION although the direct manager seems great and doing what he can to make the most of that segment, the goals are wildly unattainable compared to the Inbound, MidMarket and National segments. With the consistent failure, the directors put pressure on this segment and constantly question the failure to meet quota when the quotas are near impossible to hit. :::\r\n\r\n>> Unfortunately, because of the way that the directors have built this department and treat their employees you see valuable workers losing belief and confidence in themselves and their abilities. It also is quite obvious that this has spread to other departments so moving internally throughout Concur is becoming more an more difficult. It's heartbreaking to see these quality and overqualified employees being so discouraged and leaving this company after buying into the \"Concur dream\" because there truly is value in this company, just not in the Market Development department. There are people that have taken massive pay cuts and steps down in their career to buy into this dream and leave lost, beaten down and regretful they ever left their previous job to become part of this department."}, {"review_title": "The Best Company in the WORLD to Work For!!!!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "27 Jul 2018", "job_title": "Travel Functional Consultant in Jacksonville, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "SAP cares about every employee\r\nSAP offers more opportunities to grow and learn that any company I've worked for\r\nOur benefits are exceptional\r\nWe all feel like we bring value to the company\r\nThe Management at SAP is FABULOUS!!", "cons": "There are literally no cons I can think of to working at SAP"}, {"review_title": "Love working here!!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible work options, great people, everyone is accessible and focused on creating and sustaining great customer relationships.", "cons": "Large organization, so communication between teams is sometimes a challenge.

Soft skills such as these can be imperative across many jobs.\r\n- Plenty of SAP Certifications to learn and obtain for free.", "cons": "- Progression through the ranks is often based upon vague and unrealistic KPIs that contradict one another. Allowing for management to ensure you're not pushed up the ladder for rudimentary reasons (not enough onsites, not enough rotations, not enough knowledge transfer sessions to name but a few). These reasons often don't correlate with your actual business acumen or technical know-how. You could potentially get glowing reviews from customer interactions and support yet still be told you didn't have enough team presentations in the year...resulting in no progression.\r\n- Base pay is incredibly low compared to competitors. When trying to take out loans and mortgages, banks don't look at the \"package\" you are earning with your respective company. They look at base take home pay. With this being so low you could find yourself in a difficult situation later in life.\r\n- Whilst the travel aspect is a positive, it is also a negative. Work hours whilst onsite are ridiculous, you must adhere to the customer's demands in that regard. This can leave you working 12-15 hour days for 5 days a week whilst onsite (completely removing the flexible work hours benefit that SAP promotes).\r\n- The SAP CoE Ireland office is now used as cheap labour to the US, Canada and China. The Irish employees are sent routinely on 15 hour+ flights to these regions at the very last second and with very little notification. This results in a very low worklife balance and low morale due to insecure work conditions. You often have the feeling that you don't know where you'll be next week. Planning events in your life becomes almost impossible.\r\n- The expectation with CoE is to travel onsite/rotation for up to 6 months of the year. If you are gone for that amount of time you cannot avail of certain benefits like the fuel card or the free lunches. Both of these benefits become redundant whilst away from the Irish office. You are offered a per diem for the lunch costs incurred whilst onsite but this is often too low an amount to pay for your daily intake.\r\n- The influx of jobs within the CoE area has resulted in a massive knowledge gap between experienced and new employees. Graduates are often asked to ramp up these new colleagues resulting in the blind leading the blind. Often new employees are sent onsite without full training - the reasoning being that they can \"learn on the job\".\r\n- Unsociable work hours; whilst there is a flexible work hours initiative within SAP, this does not often apply to the CoE area of the company. As CoE is expected to cover all regions this results in staff working late shifts regularly. The EMEA timezone is in fact covered by Germany meaning that Irish staff are often working unsociable work hours from 1500-2300 every day. There is no end in sight for this as the US and APJ regions enlarge.\r\n- SAP Ireland is essentially at the whim of Germany. Every change that happens with Irish staff is controlled and dictated by German management. Often staff get the feeling that Irish management is powerless - this results in even lower morale as nothing can be changed on this side of the water."}, {"review_title": "One of the Best places to work- But can get lost easily in the crowd", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Apr 2015", "job_title": "Intern in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work Culture\r\nBest in class free food everyday\r\nFree transport\r\nGood working environment\r\nExposure to many other fields of technology\r\nDue attention given if you are SAP crazy", "cons": "Can easily get lost in the pool of employees and end up in a field that you wouldn't have been interested in"}, {"review_title": "Good, Employee friendly company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "29 Apr 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good culture, Employee friendly, Good overall package including benefits, and sundry perks including lunch.

Management hires separately for the night shift on support, but does not hire separately for second (swing) shift. So, upon being hired as an Application Specialist, there is a chance you will be put on an unusual shift requiring working until late at night and/or on weekends -- for an undetermined amount of time, often a year or more. Working on a swing shift does not come with a pay increase, though obviously it comes with a lot of added stress both personally and professionally.\r\n\r\nManagement overall is poor in the Support department. Within the department, it can be very confusing and frustrating to understand how to \"move up.\" Management is very cagey and stubborn about title or pay increases. While there is an official set of expectations in terms of how to be promoted within the department, management tends to delay or insist you \"aren't quite there yet.\" Employees accept harder, more complicated work without title or pay increases in the hopes (and sometimes, with assurances from management) that the title or pay increases will come in the future. Some end up working months or more than a year without seeing the promotion.\r\n\r\nSupport department management often had a hostile attitude towards employees that can create a toxic, tense, and needlessly stressful work environment. Some fellow coworkers of mine have described it as being similar to a \"high school\" environment in which employees are treated like misbehaving children. Almost everyone works incredibly hard, but the department seems to be perpetually understaffed, and this gap between work to be done and number of workers is not treated empathetically by management but rather as a fault of the workers.\r\n \r\nIt often felt like the Support department was stuck in a limbo state between being a call center (think Comcast) or a more typical support/application consulting department in a tech company. This can end up being quite frustrating as an employee -- especially in the earlier stages of working on Support, your job is very numbers-driven, and you will be strongly expected to handle a certain number of support cases per hour. Simultaneously, there is a strong expectation for Support employees to become more like \"consultants\" in terms of having in-depth knowledge of highly technical concepts and processes. As you might imagine, it is stressful to feel stretched by two seemingly opposing sides: I need to close X cases today but I also need to handle this very complicated and technical case that would truly require hours of research to grasp. Other parts of the company often felt at odds with support rather than on the same team, adding to the sense of pressure to do things both quickly and perfectly."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Supplier Adoption Consultant in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I've been with SAP for almost 2 years.

No matter how hard you will try, you will simply not meet impossible criteria.\r\nAnd when you do not meet the Criteria your manager will decide to not ask for bonuses for you because you did not meet those criteria. And of course, they will not tell you.\r\nZero honesty, zero communication. \r\n- Management does not respect or encourage the work-life balance. On the contrary, they force you to work afternoon shifts (10 AM> 7 PM) because there is a higher demand when the US comes to work and hiring people in the US is too expensive. There was a system introduced where you can choose your own shifts - in theory only - you cannot really choose anything and you will end up with working late shifts and killing your personal life in the process.\r\n- Micromanagement, supervision, following on each minute and constant persecution of employees is a standard\r\n- Management cannot fire you because of Basic Human and Employee rights, they will just make sure that you will get the worst of the worst if you allow yourself to speak up.\r\n\r\nColleagues are somewhat fine (I was really trying to help people around myself) but you can see yourself how people are demotivated, down, stressed and forced to absorb enormous workload. Burnout symptoms are not just visible to me but also to other people.\r\n- You will meet various characters and personas. Some funny, some boring, some rude but in general, people who are not in management positions are the only good things Ariba has.\r\n- If you make friends outside of support, it will really open your eyes as to what its like to have a normal job (yeah, not talking about the support though)\r\n- You will find out that there is enormous fluctuation - most of the people will not stay longer than two to five months.\r\n\r\nProducts are best described as something that buyers purchase and suppliers are forced to use. The frequency of failures, system downs, bugs is the highest I have ever seen in my life.\r\n- There is a saying that every week new thing breaks. It pretty much describes the way the things are. Nearly every day either internal administration app or even our main application is down. \r\n- Knowledge demanding products with disastrous administrative applications and ticketing system that actually makes your job even worse. Very difficult to use.\r\n\r\nDaily work - someone mentioned that with this amount of work you are literally glued to your seat. It is true. \r\n- If you start on the phone, prepare that you will speak about 6-8 hours every day. You will face angry customers, huge workloads and you will be in scope every minute.\r\n- If you start in the back office, prepare that you will be forced to communicate with the number of the clients via chat at the same time. Tickets are really time consuming and bad and require daily time/queue management.\r\n- There is a constant pressure on doing \"more in less time\" and even the demands are increasing (new products, new applications, new system areas etc.)\r\n\r\nSalary - where some people say that having 30 000 Netto CZK is a good thing, I oppose. Given the current range of prices in Prague, the salary is very low. And unfortunately, there is no raise whatsoever.  (unless you are promoted to a different position).\r\n\r\n Bonuses are somewhat good. Sometimes you can have fruits on Wednesday (if you are quick enough) sometimes you can have one beer on Friday (you really have to be fast).\r\n- Currently six days of SICK DAY (must be approved by management though)\r\n- Very pitiful two days a month for HOME OFFICE in the BACK OFFICE positions. (even that poor two days must be approved by management)\r\n- The Sodexo card with 1000 points a month for meal vouchers and some culture (new thing, kinda difficult to use - we had normal 90 CZK meal vouchers before).\r\n- First two weeks of Doctor approved sickness are paid / year. (must be approved by management though)\r\n\r\nOffice and open spaces - having the open office in CALL CENTER of Customer Support is a nightmare. Prepare for constant stress, no privacy, and extreme loudness.\r\n- There is not enough of room in the drawers and the noise is constant. People are looking at your back and your monitors most of the time.\r\n- The office social parts, some kitchens, some play places are technically one of the best in Prague.

Support is left to basically just do whatever the customer is demanding, not asking, but demanding. There is no real scope of what should be supported, it is just a free for all. A customer doesn't like the font the application is written in, well then it is clearly a product of the issue and needs to be fixed ASAP. The volume of work has increased tenfold within a year but the staffing has either stayed the same or decreased due to people leaving due to burnout. Management talks a big game of retaining people, but no follow through. all we are told by the parent, SAP is that adding more employees does not fix the problem. But then even when we get to hire some people it is usually only 1 person and even then there is usually a hiring freeze. So the 20 people you were supposed to get, end up being 1 person, that was supposed to start Jan 1st, but due to hiring freeze won't start until Oct 1. That is if they actually waited that long and didn't look for something else. The pay could be better for the level of stress you face on a day to day basis.

Nope, just a third of a floor with about 30 people to support a global community that grows by 10-20 customers a week.
