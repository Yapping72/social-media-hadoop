The cool thing is that you can rotate on multiple SAP teams within the first year. At the end you may select the best fit based on mutually benefits. Therefore, you may develop a big picture mindset about SAP, while contributing your strengths on many impactful product features that are using by the world's most successful businesses. I think this unique program would be the best choice for all new graduates to consider.\r\n\r\n- Application Process:\r\nThe review below is based on overall recruiting process of Silicon Valley Next Talent Program. The whole process took about one month (starting from the time that my resume was accepted and I submitted the survey form). The recruiter is pretty helpful and responsive with interview arrangements as well as status updates. The interview process has several rounds. The first round is talking your background with the recruiter. I learned about the recruiting process and what to expect after joining SVNT program. After that the second round interview is with the SVNT program manager, in which many behavioral questions were asked. I enjoyed the conversation a lot and found that the core values and team culture at SAP would be the perfect fit for me. I also felt connected with the program manager when I shared insights about my experiences and lessons learned. The third and fourth rounds are technical interviews with SAP experts in my field. The format and questions were similar to typical technical interviews with other large tech companies. One thing stood out was that all interviewers were super passionate about their work and shared many great things about working at SAP. These conversations really helped me to develop a better understanding about the benefits of SVNT program and I then decided to accept the offer from SAP instead of some other top companies.", "cons": "The overall recruiting and on-boarding process in quite smooth and many detailed guidance is provided.

Backwards titles complicates this further. This coupled with much of my other feedback lead to great employees either leaving the company, or leaving and coming back (which the CEO, SVPs, and many other leaders have done). When it comes to hiring your own team, people managers have to do the majority of searching for candidates (provided they want to assure they get the best person for the role). \r\nMost mid-level leaders are afraid of and/or avoid confrontation - Bad to mediocre employees aren't disciplined, and over-achievers aren't reward commensurate of their impact. I'm not sure anyone has ever been put on an action plan (let alone fired) at the company, which makes those that are (below) average at their job think that they just have to wait to be promoted. Leaders try to contain over-achievers by promising a bright future if they just wait, then offer you everything you want(ed) when it's too late. Senior leaders lift up concerns about employees, so do said manager's people, and yet no material corrective action is taken resulting in their great employees moving on. Wrong or right, this gives the perception that managers are more concerned with being everyone's friend and are happy with where they are, so they state that \"everyone here is great\" to make things easier vs having tough conversations or potentially ruffling feathers by having some on a faster track than their peers. \r\nTop down management style - A lot of mid-level to senior leaders don't take constructive criticism well from their employees. They get the majority of their direction from senior executives, then generally tailor to what their plan was, which delays or fractures career promises (moving targets). They no doubt mean well, but don't seem to realize that if they are authentic 98% of the time, employees are still left guessing when the other 2% is occurring (and if they can truly rely on them for their best interests). Additionally, when you ask them why overall company projections or a product launch deadline were missed, you tend to get boilerplate excuses.   \r\nSeniority can breed complacence - The most people I've ever seen in a company that have been there for the majority of their career. That's generally a good thing, but many of these people don't have a competitive background for their position that one would expect from an SAP/leader in technology. Diversity (including in professional experiences) is a good thing. A lot of the leaders that have been with the company for the majority of their career likely wouldn't be at the same level at any other comparable company, and many didn't go to school for what they are doing. Perhaps they realize this, so they never leave, and are fine with mediocre employees on their team as it won't challenge their position in company. Because many haven't worked at other major companies, they don't know any better, generally given false positive reviews on their managers and for Concur as a best place to work.

Incredibly collaborative, open culture where knowledge-sharing is the default. \r\n\r\nE.g., I have often used keywords to pick someone's name out of the corporate address book (when I need an expert, but don't know anyone to ask), and emailed or called them and say \"I am looking for someone to help with x\", and not once has anyone said \"not my job\" - every single time, and I'm talking dozens of times - the person helped me directly or gave me an introduction. \r\n\r\nYou can move around and do different jobs within the company based on your interest and career growth plan - you can even change careers completely, if you want. One friend went from product management, where he was a functional expert on a topic working with the Sales team, to being a consultant and traveling to work with customers on-site. I personally changed from pre-sales to product management to marketing over the course of my career - and was totally supported by every manager in my chain to make those changes. That's incredibly rare.\r\n\r\nThe corporate culture is the best thing about the company. Sure, there are challenges - but every company has challenges, there's no perfect work, and no job is always fun, or simple. But compared to other companies I've interviewed with, and have friends working for, SAP is not only highly ethical and personally collaborative, it's a breath of humanistic fresh air compared to most American companies in the same industry, from supporting remote work as a default for most roles, to providing competitive benefits with better-than-average vacation. \r\n\r\nAdditional pro, depending on your role (with manager approval) you can work remotely from other SAP offices or locations. For example, if you want to visit someone in another state, as long as you have your laptop you can work from their house during the day, and have the evenings free to spend with them. Or if I take vacation to the South of France for a week, I could extend the trip by 3 days and enjoy a second weekend traveling around, and  work several days from our office in Nice, and then fly home mid-week when the rates are cheaper. And when you have more vacation days to use, it's an amazing way to extend your vacation options, which for Americans in particular is in too short supply most of the time.", "cons": "1. This isn't a traditional 'con' - it's about being aware that the culture isn't a fit for everyone. If you like a high level of engagement with your manager and being given exact directions on what is expected of you, this is not likely the place for you *unless* you're seeking a Quality Management/Quality Assurance/Testing/Tech Support type role. SAP is what I call an \"entrepreneurial\" company, that gives employees a lot of latitude in how to shape their job and how to define their career path. I love it, and I've had the chance to try a lot of different roles in my time here - but I have also seen wonderful, talented, intelligent people become exceedingly frustrated. E.g., I may have a short biweekly call with my manager (who is remote), and find that sufficient for discussing my projects, but some people may feel the need to speak with their manager multiple times per week with their manager to get direction on certain problems, or talk through ideas they have. Many managers aren't used to that type of 'constant feedback loop' of engagemnet - so I think it's important to understand if you come to SAP, you're going to be trusted to make a lot of decisions on your own, and you're going to be expected by most managers to be able to do that. I've heard people complain that when they asked a manager \"What should i do?\" the manager's response was \"What do you *think* you should do?\" If that bothers you, then you may not find SAP the best fit for your preference in management style, OR you should ensure when you interview, that you discuss your preference and expectations for the level of engagment from your manager. SAP wants people to be happy, but employees also have to be self-aware to understand the corporate culture, in general, and decide if it's a fit.\r\n\r\n2. Constant, continual organizational change. Sometimes every 6 months, at least once per year. Change is common at all large businesses, but it does seem SAP moves the puzzle pieces around more often than peers.\r\n\r\n3. One of the clearest areas that we see the origins of SAP as a German company founded by engineers is the number of templates - powerpoing and spreadsheets - that are created, maintained, and mandated for people to use. You may find processes are 'over-engineered' compared to other companies, and that can be frustrating... but it's improving, and if filling out a spreadsheet is the worst thing you can say about your job, it's really not bad at all!"}, {"review_title": "Don't be fooled by the positive reviews", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "25 May 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Alpharetta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pretty decent benefits package.\r\nOffice environment.\r\nMostly friendly employees.", "cons": "Some really bad managers, especially those from acquired companies by SAP like Sybase.

Whilst generally the pay is reasonably good for most people, many (and I mean many) times the company will pay more to attract new employees than they pay to existing team members without much effort to \"normalise' the existing employees remuneration when the disparity becomes apparent.  Sometimes this even applies to existing top performers who go to winners circle year after year, but earn less than newer employees doing the same job (they might take home more because of overachieving targets, but their base salary and OTE components can be significantly lower). - This will (and does from time to time) cost SAP good people.

All of these are necessary in a sales business, but SAP now seems to be making an 'art form' of the level of detail, time, and effort required.  There is now no doubt, that the hardest \"sale\" at SAP is not to the client or the \"prospect\" but it is now \"internal\". The effect of all the \"internal stuff' is that customer facing employees spend significantly less time face to face with customers and prospects than they have ever done in the past. The reasons given for all the internal stuff are that it is supposed to ensure that people are only focussing on the things that matter, that the business in predicable, and that it all helps to reduce risk. But in the end a significant amount of people don't believe that and just do it because they are told to. The mathematical assumption and consequence of all this, I would assume, is simply more lost business opportunities than in previous years due to the reduced customer facing time (this is evidenced in some \"mature\" markets where the revenue has been fairly flat year on year recently when there were expectations of reasonable growth) ."}, {"review_title": "SAP has a great culture of diversity and respect.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "9 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Senior Product Specialist in Montreal, QC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You can and have to drive your own career and success, but you have the possibility to act like an entrepreneur in a big company. \r\nAgile Development Methodologies are used and lived in cross functional teams of ten  (scrum)\r\nState of the art methodologies (like Design Thinking) and technologies (like SAP HANA in-memory DB)", "cons": "Not all projects are working on the cutting edge technology\r\nIts hard to understand how the company works, its processes and organizations at first (it will take you about 3 months!)\r\nDepending on the size of the location big career-steps might be limited - staying in one location"}, {"review_title": "Wonderful company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Jan 2015", "job_title": "Software Support Engineer in Newtown Sq, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I thoroughly enjoy working for SAP.

Why are they looking to move?  is there an issue?  this is data that should trigger a response by management - not just recruiting.  It should include a coaching session to understand what they are looking to do, the full context, and then actively look for a role for them.  YES - a high-performing employee should have an advantage, AND research says they cost less, and add more value.  Why aren't we leveraging this? In the last 2 years, way too many talented people I know left because there was \"nothing\" here for them.

Ratings were very bad around 2016, then it looks like someone figured out they had to improve their Glassdoor position and started asking interns, new employees and managers to review positively. \r\n\r\nSAP is an IT company and despite lip service paid to embracing gender diversity and making room for women in management, it remains a profoundly misogynistic company, and what is more, it doesn't realize it is or if it does, is painfully slow to do anything about it. The talk is all up, up, up, SAP is great, oh look at all the great women leaders we have, but if you talk to other women in non-management positions, the dirty secret is that women feel their opinions and contributions are not only unrecognized but devalued and disregarded again and again. \r\nSome women in management are put on a pedestal and revered, and held up as the proof that SAP is a great place to work for women, but this is simply not the case. Unless you\u2019re part of the boys club, come from the outside with impressive credentials or are simply a ruthless corporate climber, you will get nowhere with this company. \r\n\r\nThis is a hugely political organisation. Don\u2019t expect to get anywhere unless you\u2019re already a manager or very well-connected. There are many stories of employees who do next to nothing but are protected by their connections. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not unusual for upper managers to take the credit for lower-rung employees\u2019 inputs and going to HR is worse than pointless. Their job is to support management. Any claim you bring the them will be ignored until the problem is so huge that they can\u2019t ignore it anymore, or unless they\u2019re looking for an excuse to get rid of the person complained about. Huge egos are rampant. In fact, it\u2019s next to impossible to advance unless you possess one. \r\n\r\nThe global SAP organization has some wonderful stated values, but in actuality, few people in management actually follow them. The effort to \"Build bridges, not silos\" is only recognized when management does it, \"Tell it like it is\" is a wonderful philosophy but in actually, people are afraid to speak out because, as stated, SAP is a highly political organisation and their careers will be compromised if they really do say what they think (esp. if you're a woman). \"Stay curious\" is great advice but is hard to follow when you're working 50-60 hours a week and there's no money or time for offsite training.  \r\n\r\nYes, the company has flexible hours and you can work from home, but in many roles, this is the only possible way to get the job done and raise kids at the same time, because every job in the Sales organisation is extremely demanding and cannot be accomplished without working in the evenings and weekends. (It seems very different for development roles). \r\n\r\nUnless you're very technical, have an MBA and/or are willing to relocate to the company's larger business centers (Toronto, Philadelphia, Palo Alto, NYC), there's really very few opportunities for promotion. \r\n\r\nBottom line, if you want a career in sales, willing to set your personal life aside to pursue it, are in extremely good health and are able and willing to belong to a boys club, this is a good place for you. If you want a routine job with decent pay, are willing to put up with insane amounts of stress, and are not terribly ambitious, this is a good place for you. If you're a young worker eager to get some workplace experience, this is a good place for you to start. If you're a mid-level career woman (or man) looking for a good, respectful place to do a your job, and even make your mark, the options for you are extremely limited.

Variable comp parts are very minimal and firings are pretty uncommon, despite bad performance. TLDR: Perfect company for coasting and retirement.\r\n- Perks are OK (but not great)", "cons": "Working for SAP, especially if you are the Bay Area and you want to have a career with a meaningful purpose or comp is one of the worst life choices you can make.\r\n\r\nThere's a ton of problems at SAP, but I believe many of them are symptoms of an extremely below market compensation and incentive structure which nurtures and rewards a culture of mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThey key problem areas are:\r\nCompensation (Note this is from the perspective of Engineering):\r\n - The compensation at SAP Palo Alto is severely below market. New Grads often get only around ~100k TC (total incl, bonus and stock!) and even as a seasoned engineer and high performer it is extremely difficult to get 200k total comp. Most folks I know earn between 100-150k (again incl. bonus and stocks) and have around 5YoE and are usually pretty high performing. While \"100-150k\" sounds like a lot somewhere else this is ridiculously bad for a company of SAP's size in the bay area when you are a high performer. Almost every startup, no matter how small will pay you more Base than what SAP offers as Total Comp and give you a generous stock option package on top.  Most bigger companies of SAP's size will pay you at least 1.5x, often times 2x than SAP (FANG would go even 2.5x-3x if you get lucky) . Furthermore the salary progression is very slow. If you progress as a high performer you get often times only between 2-4% salary increase per year. During a promotion you will normally get at max only get 10/11% more, often times less than that. Note typically you can get a promotion earliest every 2 years. On top of that almost everyone with your YoE gets paid the same, no matter how good or bad you're performing. I.e. If you perform 10x to the worst person in your team, you're probably still just earning about the same, max 10% more. Managers get a very small bonus and salary raise pool that they have to distribute between folks. Furthermore the pool size doesn't depend on the performance of the team. If you are in a team with only high performers the pool size is the like in teams with only low performers. Altogether the comp level is extremely low and the system does not reward performance, therefore everybody is just coasting and the whole atmosphere is very demoralizing.\r\n\r\nExtremely political and bad decision making:\r\nMost of the middle management is extremely political and just trying to keep their job / justify their existence and increase their teams headcount instead of actually making the right technology and product decisions in the interest of the company. I had one SVP even admitting this to me and saying that at \"SAP SVPs are like dukes fighting to keep power over their own little kingdom\". If you want to experience GoT real life, be SAP's guest. Often multiple organizations worldwide work on a very similar problem but instead of joining forces they're just making up arbitrary differences to avoid a conflict and keep their SVPs independent. Important technology decisions are made by SVPs and Architects in committees where 90% of the people haven't written a single line of code in decades. Every tech decision is affected by the \"not-invented-here-syndrome\" and instead of reusing existing proven OSS tech for non-differentiated components a bad SAP-copy of a technology is developed, because leaders believe they can easier sell proprietary SAP tech for top $$$ to their customers. This works in the beginning with some naive SAP fanboy customers but never leads to an industry leading product or technology and long term always leads to the same result: SAP's losing in favor of a much better and cheaper competitor. In general whoever makes the best PPT slides and talks the loudest gets to make decision and the promotion. SAP is a sales machine and not a tech company, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nImmigration Policies:\r\nThe immigration policies at SAP are an absolute nightmare. First of all you have to beg your manager and HR to file H1Bs and GC. For GC you have to be 3 years with the company until they start the process, unless you get an exception approval. If you leave the company within 1 year after getting the GC, you have to pay back all the lawyer and filing expenses. The immigration team (HR and Lawyers) are extremely unresponsive and often times don't answer for weeks or months to your emails. You basically have to beg your manager to follow up with HR / immigration on your behalf and even your manager doesn't get answers for weeks at times. Furthermore they have some weird policies like that you have to be in particular T  level (career level at sap) to file a GC in a particular category. For example for GC EB-3 you have to be in T2. If you are already in T3 this means in some cases your manager has to temporarily demote you to T2 in order to start the GC process which is just another way of keeping your comp down. Many folks I know are visa-trapped inside SAP on an L1 or E1 visa and SAP uses the visa trap to keep folks inside the company on their subpar comp. Those folks would leave the company within a blink of an eye once they get the right visa.\r\n\r\nSubpar technology and Engineering:\r\nThe engineering and technology at SAP is pretty bad overall. Because of the politics often times bad tech decisions are made and because of the bad comp SAP can't get the right talent to consistently create good tech. A lot of the core technologies that you have to use in your day-to-day work were developed and are pushed by the HQ in Walldorf where people live in their own bubble and rarely hear or acknowledge of tech industry trends before it's too late. Over-engineering is a serious problem as well.\r\n\r\nFor context I just want to add that I've worked at SAP multiple years, both in Walldorf HQ and in Palo Alto. The experiences described not only represent my personal ones but are consistent with the experiences of my network in multiple teams and locations, incl. US, Germany and India. The only location which I would mildly recommend is SAP Germany due to very good perks and OK-ish comp (that being said there are much better alternatives there too). It honestly appears like a miracle to me that SAP has a 4.4 Glassdoor rating and is rated as a Best Place to work, but can probably be explained with SAP being very good at Marketing bad stuff as Gold."}], [{"review_title": "Awesome Company, However not for people who want to work on latest Technologies", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Developer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing Environment.

Also managers are constantly fighting for work off other managers in the same org unit. \r\nUntil about 2 weeks ago i was on a team with almost 100 people under 1 manager. \r\nI can tell you several managers favorite people who get the most benefits regardless of performance. \r\nDue to it being a large org i have had projects taken off me no matter how much prep i have done for very silly reasons. And this will impact my career. Things like \"new employee needed to ramp up/ this employee had no work to do/ looks better if this employee works on this\" and usually ends with \"you can work on this other thing\". Basically if I get a customer to agree to do some work and do a lot work to achieve that, there is no guarantee I will get the benefits for it.  \r\nHeard my manager say to some new hires the phrase \"we dont train you like we used to, we rely more on on the job training\". And I know for a fact that he believed that this was a good thing. \r\nCant guarantee that your skill set will be useful in a few years as teams are created and destroyed regularly.

It gets really annoying, for example, when the annual 3rd/4th quarter headcount freeze hits, because you know it always lifts at the start of next year, and all the hiring gets done then. I feel bad for really good candidates who are simply \"unlucky\" in the timing of their graduation. There's also the odd business policies occasionally, such as no more on-site stationery. Not a big deal, but it's a good example of the strange instructions that come down from HQ sometimes. It's a behemoth of a company, with lots of constantly shifting parts - but I'm sure it's the same at most companies of this magnitude.\r\n\r\n- Not all roles are built equal.

The client does this so that SAP will have \"skin in the game...\" but still pay low rates for the majority of the team.  Sometimes you discover that the other consultants have no real implementation experience, which can put you in a difficult political situation.  Also, you are required to solve all of the toughest problems because you are considered to be the expert (a living-and-breathing-SAP-help-file).   Your higher rate also means that the client will wait as long as possible before bringing you on and can be very picky about how many hours you work."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work (**conditions applied**)", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "21 May 2013", "job_title": "Senior Developer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to work on one of the best software platforms in the world, you get to work with colleagues (esp.

SAP has been in industry leader since 2014 delivering an Annual \"Integrated Report\" which considers the corporate impact on the environment and our sustainability, to use a holistic view of our total impact beyond finances as our measure of success each year.  We also have a range of employee interest groups including Business Women's Network, Black Employees Network, and are one of Workplace Pride's Top 10 companies in the world for LGBTQ-friendly  workplace environment and policies.  Inter-cultural training is provided to help teams in different countries understand how to work and communicate more effectively with each other. This is not about political correctness; it's about being respectful of others' cultures and different points of view, even if you have different beliefs. \r\n\r\nGLOBAL REACH/IMPACT:  If you eat it, drink it, drive it, wear it, or use it in your daily life, our customers probably make it. E.g., 78% of the world's food supply is delivered by SAP customers (including 82% of the world's chocolate supply, and 72% of the world's beer).  That is incredible - but it also is a key reason our Board and CEO have a mission to \"Help the world run better and improve people's lives\". If your company touches 70% of financial transactions that happen daily, globally, you have an opportunity and a responsibility to think about how that reach can benefit people - not just ourselves.  A lot of people struggle wanting to work somewhere that makes a difference - I've found working at SAP I have a long-term career where I do make a difference, in ways that I can't imagine other companies could. Very cool.\r\n\r\nSUPPORT TO INNOVATE & TAKE RISKS:  the CEO says \"tell it like it is\" and take informed risks and as far as I've seen, this is supported (standard caveat of, \"when it's done in a constructive, and respectful way\".  This may partly be a function of German work culture, but I've found the openness here refreshing compared with friends' experiences.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE-DRIVEN: SAP's mission FOR YEARS is \"Help the world run better and improve people's lives\". This was our mission before it was 'cool'. This was our mission before terms like 'green-washing' and 'virtue-signaling' came into mainstream conversations. We have had CSR programs for more than 20 years; we have had sustainability programs for at least a decade; we've had excellent benefits like paid parental leave for adoptions, paid bereavement leave (immediate family ), affordable healthcare, paid vacation starting at 3 wks (sick days are separate from vacation days), subsidized public transportation, and our larger offices there are employee cafeterias where you can get subsidized lunches (hot food, not just deli-style food), sourced locally when possible, and with vegetarian and vegan options. \r\n\r\nTRAINING & CAREER SUPPORT:  a robust program for growing within the company means once you join SAP, you can do a wide range of jobs and change careers - as I did - multiple times without leaving the company. I personally attribute this to the German business model, which brings in young talent and nurtures it, versus the typical American model where recruiters look for existing-employed individuals and attempt to hire them away.  This model means a lot of people stay at SAP for a long time compared to other tech companies - but the ability to move around within the company and try different jobs keeps your career fresh and interesting. There are formal and informal job training programs, formal Mentoring and Coaching programs, internal recruiters to help people move around, and - one of the best things - opportunities to work in other countries for short term or permanent assignments, with the most opportunities in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.", "cons": "LARGE BUSINESS COMPLEXITY:  the entrepreneurial spirit is real, but SAP still is a large enterprise, with a broad portfolio of software and there's just a layer (or layers) of complexity that's unavoidable.  Approvals are layered and things don't move as fast as you want/should. No worse than other places, better than many. \r\n\r\nRE-ORGs: all companies in tech go through reorganizations more frequently than companies in traditional fields like manufacturing, but SAP is somewhat known for moving teams and organizations around faster than average.  Depending on your role in the company, you could have a new focus in your job every year without actually moving to a new team. \r\n\r\nIf you hate change and having to constantly learn new things, this will be challenging for you.  But if you get bored easily, this could be a positive even if it can be frustrating."}, {"review_title": "Awesome Place to Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Software Developer in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- The company's long-term prospects are looking great.

Lots of movement towards newer technologies as well. There will be no shortage of demand for development work, or opportunities to challenge yourself if that's what you want to do.\r\n\r\n- Good work-life balance is promoted. Devs aren't on-call all the time. No expectation to be constantly crunching, unlike other places.\r\n\r\n- High performers are recognized and rewarded. Lots of opportunity for advancement.\r\n\r\n- People with ideas and opinions on how things can improve are encouraged to share, especially if you're willing to be part of the solution.", "cons": "- SAP is in the \"A-tier\" of compensation, but not \"S-tier\". There are a few other companies in Vancouver that pay the top of the top (about 2.5x the average), whereas SAP is in the level below that (2x the average). The kind of talent at SAP is about the same, so you do take a pay cut in exchange for better work-life balance. This also causes issues with losing some really good talent to competitors.\r\n\r\n- Culture changes as product in Vancouver Labs starts to mature. Less startup-like perks, less free-flow spending on miscellaneous things like free food, events, etc.\r\n\r\n- Technology challenges such as old frameworks that can be difficult to work with (SAP UI5), technical debt, etc. Still lots of work left to overcome these challenges, all the while needing to balance the need for aggressive product growth."}, {"review_title": "Great People, Great Opportunities, Great Benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "30 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Senior Director in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I've worked at SAP for many years and I'm continually impressed with how helpful employees are to each other. It drives me to make an extra effort so that anyone who comes to me leaves feeling that I removed a big unknown or roadblock for them. I believe these small behaviours add up to a great performance from the whole organization. \r\nAfter years at SAP, the one thing that has kept me is the ability to work on what I want. There are so many industries and technologies that SAP covers that you can start in a new technology area or run a large team or even have your new idea turned into a business.\r\nFinally, the benefits are very good - salary, bonuses, lunch card but more importantly I find for some are nice extras are the health benefits and support services like counseling to career path support and even resume writing. Also, I would like to add that working from home has been hugely helpful as I start a family as I can manage my life and work schedule together.", "cons": "I believe it's hard to say there is a con with SAP, or if there is, they will likely solve it. It's more like, one is looking for red and SAP only has blue, or blue, green, orange, black. So a con might be that SAP doesn't fit what one is looking for right now. Do some research and learn what SAP can offer you. SAP is a large company with many offices. If you want to work in a small social networking startup and like the challenge of fighting it out to overcome all odds for a big win (or big loss) then maybe SAP isn't for you. With that said, if you want to experiment in a safer environment, with strong support services, access to customers and access to experienced people then  SAP could work for you."}], [{"review_title": "Beautiful campus, treats employees well.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Jun 2008", "job_title": "Contractor in Newtown Square, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strong company, beautiful campus, treats employees very well.
