Policies and documents on non-discrimination, equality, and anti-retaliation are not followed, and if any of these items are challenged, people are fired.\n\nManager-employee sexual relationships, paired with nepotistic account assignment and promotion, are commonplace. There are unspoken rules that these relationships are not to be discussed.\n\nThe multiple 2022 Bloomberg articles are only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nChristian is Hasso\u2019s boy and is the son of a German politician. His advancement has nothing to do with his capabilities.\n\nAll white, mostly male executive leadership team cited Adaire Fox-Martin\u2019s replacement \u2014 a white male \u2014 as a \u201cdiversity decision\u201d because he is Australian.\n\nBullying leadership forces working all time zones, holidays, weekends, children\u2019s birthdays, and family milestones at threat of being fired, even for top performers (I was once told, \u201cit\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day [a Sunday], so let\u2019s take the rest of the day off\u201d). The same leadership forces working through serious illness and shames taking sick time even as physicians state that illness mandates time off work.\n\nGood people have been run over and discarded to preserve those in boys club. Some women even promote boys club culture.\n\nPromotion to leadership roles rarely has anything to do with leadership capabilities.\n\nThose with integrity, human kindness, and customer focus are leaving. Those protected by the culture described above are opting to stay.\n\nA smoke and mirrors approach is leveraged to inflate ACV: all on-premise/perpetual license customers *must* shift to subscription with rare exceptions. On-premise/perpetual license revenue to SaaS shift reflected in financial documents is merely a matter of this policy, not actual cloud adoption. This \u201cstrategy\u201d is leveraged by multiple historically on-premise software firms \u2014 Google it. Shareholders place value on SaaS revenue growth, which is why SAP and others implement related policies. The CapEx to OpEx shift is not beneficial for every customer, nor is TCO reduced in a cloud model for every customer, regardless of what marketing collateral says. The concept of SaaS is manipulated and redefined to serve the needs of SAP and increase share price, not benefit customers. Much of the product base is not actually SaaS, but a subscription-based commercial model placed around the exact same code and product as traditional on-premise software.\n\nCollectively, SAP treats its people horribly, has a largely toxic culture, facilitates bullying and threats to job security, refuses any feedback, fires those who attempt to bring light to major issues, sweeps sexually illicit manager-employee relationships under the rug, has a history of repeated nepotism and refusing compensation (Google \u2018SAP lawsuits\u2019), completely fails to follow the anti-discrimination and non-retaliation policies it cites, enables a boys club environment at all levels (including Christian Klein), treats sexual assault with utter disregard, and thinks it can fool customers and shareholders with flashy marketing of fake SaaS products and a commercial model that disguises actual SaaS revenue."}, {"review_title": "Very good company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Engineer in S\u00e3o Leopoldo, Rio Grande do Sul", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "every single thing in the company is great", "cons": "No Cons, I love to work there"}, {"review_title": "A very good company to learn but too much work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Quality Specialist in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I believe the learnings in SAP are endless, there will always be work and something great to learn in the project and with the colleagues with other benefits too.

The experience, for example, in the Global Center of Expertise (a support/consulting function) can be condescending. While never the target myself, I saw others publicly berated multiple times when they could have been coached instead. Additionally, if you made a mistake in front of certain leadership, it would be very difficult to recover from. I did not experience either of these elements from other business units I served in. There were specific leaders, who had been raised in the organization over a long period of time, who were ultimately responsible for both of these issues. To be fair, some of those same leaders had some redeeming qualities as well--including really going to bat for people when it was time for a raise . But those qualities were not enough to overcome the negatives for the leadership in place. \n\nIf after a long time working at the company you decide to pursue a career change, I would advise not trying to complete the transition within SAP. One might think it would be easier to change internally, it is not. There is a huge headcount is gold culture among hiring managers; which is likely true in many organizations. However, at SAP it makes it incredibly difficult to make a change even with transferable skills. It essentially makes hiring managers unwilling to take a chance that they might take otherwise, on someone who has great transferable skills but might not have the functional background (which they could learn). Examples of my own experiences included:\n- 10+ interviews for one position, but then having an external consultant chosen instead\n- A manager told me I didn't have enough experience in their function despite the fact that I was willing to reduce my grade in order to grow and had significant levels of transferable skills.\n- Many hiring managers, after 2-3 (sometimes more) interviews, never get back to you; you find out weeks later through automated notifications that you didn't get the job; when they did let you know, they almost never responded to requests for feedback that would help you grow"}, {"review_title": "Average salary hectic work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Senior Devops in Walldorf, Baden-Wurttemberg", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Job security as long as Germany is not going in economical crisis", "cons": "Big, you are number, Locals are given priority over you for all top post wether eligible or not"}, {"review_title": "CES Co-op", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Customer Engagement Support Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture and very diverse", "cons": "Very big and hard to learn"}, {"review_title": "Nice company for people who don\u2019t have too many aspirations", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Developer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Product based company, well known so it\u2019ll be easier to land interviews at FAANG and other tech companies", "cons": "- Flex work makes no sense, it is just a hybrid model where they\u2019ll ask you to move to base location regardless\n- If you\u2019re on a team that uses SAP technologies like UI5, CAP, Piper, BTP you\u2019re out of luck because you\u2019ll gain no knowledge that you can use outside SAP\n- Some teams have bad work life balance (specially if it is a new product or a rework on an existing product)"}, {"review_title": "Great company with benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Oct 2022", "job_title": "SAP Materials Management Consultant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Able to work from home Insurance", "cons": "Work is too technical unless you speak programming"}, {"review_title": "transformation underway", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Industry Advisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "company has made the move to be cloud native - and restructuring in a good way", "cons": "very matrixed organization - hard to know who to talk to."}, {"review_title": "Overall a great workplace", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "10 Oct 2022", "job_title": "EA/TQM in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salaries, great benefits, flexible worklife", "cons": "Constant restructuring and redoing things, just with a new name"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "7 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Senior Operations Business Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits Employees are treated very well Great team work Nice employees", "cons": "None that I can think of"}], [{"review_title": "Great to be recognized!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "21 Jun 2022", "job_title": "CSP", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "SAP is the type of quality organization you hope to work at and are able to make a life-long career in.

Where do we/what do we do by taking leaves?? Not all employees are at safe location. Also previously there was some flexibility with each team allotted budget, to use it in a better way & more options.This year the policy is like, those team budget can be used only for lunch, dinner/virtual events. Why SAP restricting these much with lunch & dinner even at pandemic situation & majority of the employees are not happy with this proposal, still forcing some things just in favor of some management. This kind of behaviour seems to be like SAP is becoming like a service-based company and has reduced value of employees concerns.

In the more than 12 years I have worked for SAP I have watched many managers who are incompetent or barely competent continue to get promoted or remain in their position with no consequence for their behavior or lack of skill. Their hiring process is so filled with nepotism that the only way to change jobs is to be friends first with the hiring manager. HR does nothing to stop these practices and does not care that qualified internal candidates are being overlooked and dismissed due to the inherent \"friends and family\" hiring practices. They do not pay people well and offer very little in compensation for raises unless you work in sales. They will push any raise you get into your bonus to avoid paying you more money in your base salary. They have very old school hierarchical approaches to everything and fight against change that could be innovative and beneficial unless it comes from someone they are friends with or aligned politically with. It's a very political organization which does a great job of pretending they care about diversity and inclusion but they demonstrate that they do not through hiring and promoting people who are unqualified for their roles while overlooking people internally who are qualified. Their internal systems are inefficient and there is continual duplication of work due to poor planning and communication practices. It's the most uninspiring, tedious organization I have ever worked for outside of the US government. The most egregious thing they do is create unnecessary obstacles to getting work done through processes that are ineffective and cumbersome, which are continually changing without notice or information. Beyond all of that, the other incredibly harmful cultural norm they have is to NEVER have a discussion about resources beyond headcount. There is no discussion of whether we have enough resources to get work done just the expectation that if you are told this needs to be done you will find a way to add it to your already overwhelming work schedule. This leads to mediocre work that has no real impact on the organization or work that creates no real contribution because no one took the time to create a realistic resource-driven project that holds up to reasonable scrutiny."}, {"review_title": "Life at SAP", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Associate Developer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Have been a part of 2 teams so far and in both the teams I had a good work life balance.\r\nGood culture overall as a result team members are very supportive.", "cons": "The difference in salary for freshers joining in from college, there is a big difference based on the tier of one's college and this initial difference is very hard to fix even after performing very good."}], [{"review_title": "SAP good place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Senior SAP Consultant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "awesome place to work.\nculture is relaxed", "cons": "pay is not as per market"}, {"review_title": "Finance Specialist", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Finance Specialist in Prague", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "managers\nstaff\nbonus\nwork/life balance", "cons": "salary, location, team size, lack of communication"}, {"review_title": "Great company with multicultural people", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "18 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Business Analyst in Slough, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Earn additional holidays with years of experience with the company\nAdditional benefits like electric car purchase, Yearly body health check.
