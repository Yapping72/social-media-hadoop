This characteristic, set foremost by Bill Gates, has continued to imbue the culture of the entire company, down to individual employees. Its annual Giving Campaign elicits participation from nearly all employees. At Microsoft, it's quite common to support coworkers towards their charitable causes, and to talk about charitable giving regularly. I thought that was common to all companies, but it's not -- it's actually relatively rare to have a company culture that has philanthropy so close to its core.\nThere are a lot of choices for what to work on. Server to client, consumer to enterprise, software to firmware to hardware -- there's just a boatload of choice to switch around in the company. Though I always stayed on the software side, I managed to work in Office, MSN, Windows, Tablet PC, and Bing Search during a span of 12 years.\nSeattle, despite what detractors say, is, in my opinion, an amazing city to live in, especially if you have (or plan to have) a family. It's very progressive, huge on the outdoors, has amazing summers, and also has the nation's highest percentage of college grads, which makes for interesting conversation wherever you go.", "cons": "I'm sure it used to be good place, but I've found so many examples of really bad management, lack of (real) commitment to work/products/customers. I haven't seen a good example of teamwork in years, also nobody cares about \"code quality\", technical expertise, and all that matters in building great software. Most Principal and Seniors I've seen are mostly consumed by the politics created by their managers or upper management and worried about their own performance reviews rather than taking responsibility of product, people or customers they are getting paid from. Every year I've seen two things constantly on my reviews \"Technical awesomeness\", \"Improve on communication\" (from multiple managers). Actually I think I'm just an average developer and I've seen (technically) awesome people elsewhere.

This is tied to the second item list below but is probably the most damning thing about Microsoft. If you are a level 60 (random) and you would like to interview for a great job posted at level 61. Your ability, experience, resume, position or any other work-related attribute doesn't matter. You will be told that you are not able to loop (interview) for the job. The only exceptions are executive level bypass when is nearly unheard of. This policy suppresses career growth and is compounded by the second point below. \n\n2. Microsoft has a policy that when you are promoted you don't get a level or pay increase. They treat job titles and job levels differently. If you become a Senior in your field with all the extra work that entails you will not be given any extra pay or bonus or anything. That is because of a HR policy that FORBIDS increasing a person's level (which is your pay) with their job title (which is what you do). Level increase are very difficult to obtain. Hence the reason so many people boomerang. Boomeranging is when you leave Microsoft for a couple of years and come back at the level and job you originally wanted and were qualified for. Everyone at Microsoft is well aware of this problem and is powerless to influence HR into any different action. This leads to many high-quality employees leaving the company. We have been calling it the \"Brain-Drain\". When HR is asked about why they have such a bad policy they give a standard answer of (We want our employees to do a job not for the money but for the job itself). That is not true. They are suppressing employee wage increases that should be commensurate with title and work increases. If you are looking to accept a job at Microsoft. Ask what level the job is. Ask what level it could be.

Salaries are joke. Comparing to Google, Facebook, Hubspot, Twitter and other big players in Ireland, Microsoft pays less. Sometimes even 20-30%. They will tell you that 'they're adjusting salaries to market' but it's not really a thing. If you wanna earn a lot of money (especially in sales) go elsewhere. Negotiation/salary increase/promotion is rather symbolic and the promotion process has been criticized many times by employees yet nothing much has changed. There's a bigger change of getting promoted if you're 'visible' than getting rewarded for your hard work. That means there's a very little chance to get a proper salary increase regardless if you're a senior or not. Fun fact: Even MS managers tend to say - if you want a raise, quit and come back after 2 years. \r\n\r\n2. Taxation in Ireland is ridiculously high -> keep that in mind when considering an offer. Income tax is around 40% and bonuses are taxed 50%! Big chunk of sales salary is a bonus... so do the math. There's nothing much Microsoft does in order to change it (even though they could, there are special tax schemes that, neither you get any benefits while paying highest taxes in the country. (No free healthcare, no public transport, no free childcare + ridiculously expensive rentals starting from 1700EUR/a month for 1bed apartment).\r\n \r\n3. No career growth opportunities in Digital Sales. As a few other people mentioned already, Irish managers are always first to consider, regardless of their experience. That makes it really difficult for anyone else becoming a manager. Other than first line manager position, there's not much available (unless you wanna change position/workload but that's not too much of a change now is it. Finding a job outside of Digital Sales is very challenging and can take years (although it's possible).\r\n\r\n4. Visibility Bubble.
