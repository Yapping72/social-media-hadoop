Your success at MS UK is purely determined by how much Azure consumed revenue you are *perceived* to generate. I say perceived because many people work the internal optics and do very well indeed financially and progress through the ranks, despite little actual impact on revenue, either because they align themselves to large cashcow accounts which generate huge revenue streams regardless or they busy themselves doing stuff which ticks internal boxes at the expense of customers relationships. Most managers are not remotely technical and only really care about three things 1) their  bonuses and role status / preservation 2) perceived adherence to the Microsoft corp values (at the expense of actually managing and resolving issues), and 3) ensuring none of their reports outshine them. Internal politics are sadly given far more importance than customer relationships in terms of career progression. There are some really great technical people stuck in grades which do not reflect their talent and customer focus, purely because either they fall foul of the stringent diversity policies, or are not willing or capable of playing the internal optics. Sadly many of these people are managed by sales directors of a bygone era of shrink-wrapped software and boxes of hardware. In addition, many (but not all) sales people pathologically take credit for other people's work without a shred of integrity. The performance appraisal system is easily played and is highly subjective; allowing managers to weaponise it to their advantage.

Microsoft is a rare company that understands \"if you take care of your employees, they will take care of your company.\"\r\n\r\n- I dare you to find a better 401k match. 50% on any contribution amount, up to the government's limit. AND it vests immediately. It's yours from day one. Literally $10,250 of free money on top of normal compensation.\r\n\r\n- Healthcare is great. Tier 1 in the US for sure. Maybe there's a couple companies out there with better coverage. But Microsoft doesn't charge you for it. Literally zero dollars out of the employee's paycheck. There's a fee to add a spouse or domestic partner denying their own company's coverage, but that's fair. Also no added cost for dependents. That's amazing.\r\n\r\nParental leave. They match the WA State policy of 12 weeks (+ more for birth mothers). It's super easy to take advantage of, and it's available Day 1 of employment. It's unfortunate that this benefit feels \"special\" in the US, but I'm thankful for it.\r\n\r\n- Base is competitive. But actually competitive. Not how bs companies say it as a way to compete with you for the lowest pay possible. They get it. They need and want to get quality people, and keep them at Microsoft.\r\n\r\n- Any negative culture stigmas from a couple decades ago are gone. The culture now is relentlessly supportive and accommodating. Work life balance is preached. We're all adults here, trusting other adults to do their job, regardless of what hours they need to do it.\r\n\r\n- Signing bonus + stock bonus + annual bonus. Work hard, get more. Beautiful.\r\n\r\nI've historically cringed at people who spewed love for their company on Glassdoor. It always screamed \"I'm and HR drone posting fake reviews to cover up all the bad ones.\" But here I am. Not an HR drone, a real human grateful to be in the Microsoft bubble. Believe it or not.", "cons": "Let's be real. No company is perfect. Work is work. But for sake of not being \"everything is perfect,\"\r\n\r\n- It's a huge company. The endless abyss of information, acronyms, jargon, etc can be obnoxious. Onboarding can be comical. Where do I find xyz? What's actually important? What version of comparable documents is the \"right\" one? But that's easily combatted by asking someone who knows.\r\n\r\n- Huge company means lots of \"hurry up and wait.\" Let's be honest, that's frustrating. You're bound to encounter differing opinions and such. \"Looks good, but ope, now there's feedback from another group, and now we need approval from xyz.

Lots of internal mailing lists for different hobbies to facilitate meetups and community building.\n\nCreative outlets in the form of yearly hackathons and The Garage, an independent group inside Microsoft that coordinates smaller hackathons and guest speakers relevant for certain topics such as game development and virtual reality.\n\nGood place to retire or to jump start your resume.", "cons": "Your overall experience at Microsoft is very team dependent, with some organizations' actions contradicting the values set by the company's mission statement. This manifests in poor cross-team communication, misalignment of interests between teams, and tribalism. This leads to a poor collaborative culture where every team acts only in the best interests of their own team, and not for the company as a whole. How can you empower every person and every organization in the world if you can't even empower your own employees?\n\nCompensation is not as competitive as other FAANG companies. While Microsoft comp is still very good compared to most non-FAANG companies, this signals that Microsoft is not willing to take the initiative to be competitive with their main competitors. What ends up happening is that the best talent ends up leaving for greener pastures and all the mediocre ones stay, causing a \"brain drain\" where engineering standards steadily decrease. Microsoft is not interested in retaining its best talents contrary to their claims.\n\nIt is much easier to interview external companies than it is to switch to different organization. If you want to transfer to a different organization within Microsoft (say, from Windows to Xbox), you have to apply to a job posting created by the organization of interest and go through an interview loop as if you're an external applicant. Assuming they even read your application, you being a Microsoft employee gives you no advantage as the loop does not take into account your positive Connects, manager testimonials, etc. I've made more progress in a few months' worth of external interviewing than I did trying to transfer internally for years. Yes, Microsoft is entrenched in various markets, but you most likely won't be able to enter most of them unless if you boomerang or have insider connections (which is outside of your control). Again, Microsoft is not interested in retaining talent despite Microsoft selling you on the idea that they want to keep and cultivate talent.\n\nWork life balance is a hit or miss depending on several variables such as team dynamics, your seniority level, and the quality of your team's engineering processes. In my team, engineers are put in oncall rotations with little to no training in the product area, poor organization of information, and not being taught to take initiative in solving problems. This leaves the most senior, competent, and knowledgeable engineers being put on 24/7 virtual oncall where they can get pinged/paged/called/etc during off hours by engineers that are officially oncall but couldn't/wouldn't find relevant information themselves. I've even been texted several times to come online and help with an issue, WHILE I WAS ON VACATION!\n\nFurthermore, if you're perceived as a competent engineer, expect to be stretched thin with increased responsibilities but little to no resources to deliver on said responsibilities. This led to competent engineers burning out while the mediocre ones are able to coast by. Even when brought up in one-on-ones, the issue was dismissed with a nonchalant \"we tried but we can't fix it\" response. It's almost as if Microsoft rewards mediocrity more than competency. There is an ongoing myth about Microsoft being the pinnacle of work life balance, but I find that it's mostly true if you're junior or are unmotivated.\n\nMicrosoft claims to be customer obsessed and seeks to offer a delightful customer experience, but my experiences with seeing poor development practices and seeing products fail the most basic use cases (implying a lack of quality testing) lead me to believe this is just another buzzword. Microsoft is more concerned about crossing off checkmarks and delivering fast rather than being honest about their products and taking corrective action. This leads to technical debt, loss of morale, and burnout.\n\nOn a slightly unrelated note; even during my tenure at Microsoft, I've favored competing products over Microsoft's counterpart. I'll use Google Docs over Word any day, Dropbox over OneDrive, and I ended up selling my Xbox One but kept my PS4. I'm not familiar with the teams behind those products, but based on my experiences here, I wouldn't be surprised if their lack of quality translated to my dissatisfaction with those products.\n\ntl;dr your mileage may vary at Microsoft as each team is different, so be prepared to jump ship if your working conditions don't line up with their promises and your own expectations.
