Don't negotiate level, negotiate salary.  It was essentially better to come in under-leveled but at the pay you expected and out-perform expectations of you, resulting in a bigger performance bonus and a potential promotion which would then likely include a raise.  Sadly, industry hires that came in appropriately leveled (salary commensurate with skills)  would then be calibrated against everyone else at that level regardless of their tenure almost guaranteeing a less than stellar performance based on expectations of everyone at that level.
