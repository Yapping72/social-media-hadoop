Everyone knows their job and sticks to it. People shouldn't take this for granted because in other places, sometimes even your job description and/or expectations is ambiguous. The benefits are great especially free health care. I always felt like my managers and peers had my best interest and my career advancement in mind right up alongside the team's success. I believe that MS is a company of integrity, one that support great causes and supports the employee as far as possible.\r\nThere is always someone to learn from or some piece of technology to learn about right there in house. So learning and mentorship opportunities are both plentiful.", "cons": "You can gain quite a bit of weight from the free drinks, affordable lunches, and frequent summer morale get togethers so while all of the above is good, you need to take advantage of your ProClub pass. \r\n\r\nThe only other downside, I can think of, and I am really struggling, is that you can easily get so comfortable at Microsoft that you never ever leave. I have felt like this and spoken with others who have to force themselves to see other career options/moves.

Getting involved in these projects can be exciting and even historic in many cases.\r\nInternal flexibility: If you don't like your job, boss, team, building location, or even industry, take a look around internally and dip your toes in the water somewhere else.  It is pretty easy to maneuver the internal job market.", "cons": "Slow to react to industry trends: Microsoft has been historically about 2-3 years behind where they should be from an innovation perspective.  See next point for the reason why.\r\nToo many meetings and approvals needed to make decisions: I can't stress this enough.  Be prepared to move VERY, VERY slowly to get almost anything accomplished.\r\nToo many overlapping functions: There's fat in many of the organizations that could be trimmed.  Another reason why it takes so long to make decisions.\r\nEngineering dominates most business strategies and decisions: This is how Microsoft was built, and it still exists in the corporate culture today.

We'd explain that the products couldn't actually do that and the reaction would be along the lines of \"AND WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?\" If it was important, we'd take the technical facts to Bill, and Bill would intervene and shut him down. It was a decent balance of power. Ballmer's drive to do the impossible would get Bill to do things he wasn't inclined to do, but only if they were POSSIBLE. Yes, there was a time when I loved Microsoft and worked with great enthusiasm in that niche of the \"not technically impossible\". I did a lot of risky things knowing that I could always count on Bill to rein things in when I could prove they weren't technically possible, or so difficult they simply weren't practical. \r\n\r\nBut Bill is gone now. Since taking over, Ballmer has promoted other similarly-minded marketers around him, so now he's completely cocooned in layers of marketing fluff with absolutely no basis in reality. He doesn't know the difference between an actual product and a picture of a product. And just to improve the whole customer-focus and employee-focus thing - he's imported old IBM (Kevin Johson) and legacy Wal-Mart (Kevin Turner). \""}, {"review_title": "Love the company, hate the culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Mar 2010", "job_title": "Site Manager II in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Microsoft is a huge company with tons of opportunity and lots of places to work.

There is much talk about diversity in race and gender without much true action. While HR says that pay disparity is less than one percent by gender BY JOB LEVEL, women must note that in many cases they are doing the same job as a man but being paid at a lower level...so it is all semantics. As an example, many female sales managers in the US are level 64. Male sales managers are often level 66. When MSFT says women and men are paid the same by level, in the example above this would mean that L64 female sales managers are paid at the same rate as L64 men...but they leave out that level 64 men are sales reps. Equality would be raising the women to the same level 66 as their male counterparts and paying the same amount for an equal job.  With MSFTs semantics issues, women should start to be concerned with the integrity of the company as it relates to the core company values.

If you have a good idea and are willing to work to make it happen, you can. I have worked at Microsoft for nearly 13 years and, while the \"good old days\" had some great things (more money, fewer layers of management) the company has gradually improved in most ways. People are more respectful of each other. The company is more diverse. There is a greater variety of jobs and opportunities to pursue. As a post-adolescent company, Microsoft increasingly values work/life balance. You are expected to work hard but don't need to kill yourself unless you really want to. The other thing that I think is cool about Microsoft is that the company generally doesn't give up. 15 years ago, Microsoft was a PC software company. Then management decided that Microsoft needed to be an enterprise software company too. Nobody gave Microsoft much of chance to be a serious enterprise software company. Today, most big companies use Microsoft software. Similarly, today most don't give Microsoft much of chance of being a successful \"internet\" company (vague definition, I know). But Microsoft will keep at it and will eventually succeed. No, we won't \"kill\" Google. That's not the point. But Microsoft and its employees are tenacious and that's a great quality for a company and its employees.\u201d", "cons": "Social interaction throughout the day is minimal.
