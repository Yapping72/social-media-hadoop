It was horrible to work in a company with that attitude and I'm so glad to have left that behind. There are not even people at HR to contact (even when resigning), you use one (of the dozens) of tools they have at Nokia to submit enquiries even to HR.

It took years to turn the culture around, still very far from the old Nokia culture and values (ex. Customer Satisfaction, Respect for the individual, Achievement, Continuous learning). \r\n\r\nThen Nokia purchased back the Siemens stake (2013) so became the only owner of the whole company. That turned out as a great move. Somehow Nokia culture came back and in two years reached the same level as it was in the 90s with tremendous success, clear vision, great execution, openness, direction, but did not last as in 2015, Nokia purchased Alu. That turned all upside-down.\r\n\r\nBasically the culture that came with the acquisition also thrived. Unfortunately it was the one of lying, cheating, secrecy and so on as most of the leadership team came from Alu or outside Nokia. In other words, Alu purchased Nokia with Nokia money as none of the Nokia values where preserved. Fast forward 5 years later, to 2020 and here is the result:\r\n\r\n- Management by fear with \"know it all\" attitude. Problems, opinions or arguments of any kind, even well documented are not accepted, moreover are punished.\r\n- \"Fake it till you make it\" is the name of the game. Winer is the one that lie, cheat, fake as much as possible. When caught, even by the internal ethics committee, they are not punished, but moreover, they are most of them promoted.\r\n- Management does not trust or even bothered to listen to experts and engineers, as a result, peoples does not trust management. Very vicious circle, hard to break especially that top management is surrounded by lieutenants that only execute blindly the orders.\r\n- Promotion and encouragement of total secrecy and fierce internal competition making peoples and teams to hate each other, fight for their life basically. No sharing of info. A lot of duplicate work just because of the \"not made here\" disease. As a result, best solutions never win.\r\n- Pure politically driven decisions against the Nokia overall health. No corporate global long term vison. No alignment between business units of any kind.\r\n- Management totally disconnected and blinded by their own political agendas. It seems that they are in a closed loop not accepting any input that is not aligned or does not confirm their personal views.\r\n- Continuous layoffs (at least once a year in last 10 years) based on random decisions, very much accelerated after the Alu acquisition. In other words, does not matter what you do, how you do, how you perform. If you are in the wrong place, in the wrong time, you are out. It happened that for a certain project, best of the best where gathered to make it happened and one year later, all fired when project was ditched.\r\n- Continuous internal reorganisations (up to 4-5 reorganisations only in 2019), basically breaking teams, breaking network, breaking all connections, very hard to accomplish anything. No explanations, no justification. \r\nChanges just for the sake of changes.\r\n- Peoples wellbeing is only on paper: filthy offices, very noisy open spaces, zero facilities for any activities except some ridiculous gyms in very bad locations, ethical office is just show off as does not have in practice any effect, compensation below industry average."}, {"review_title": "Software development in an respectful and diverse environment, using the latest technologies", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 May 2020", "job_title": "Squad Group Leader in Ulm, Baden-Wurttemberg", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "International and diverse environment, open and respectful atmosphere where any problem can be discussed without blaming, common sense to get things done, always using the latest SW development tools and processes, a lot of responsibility and development opportunities for those that want to take the challenge", "cons": "Sometimes the organization acts too much KPI driven"}, {"review_title": "Good place to settle if you have a family", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Athens, Attica", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stability, good working environment, flexible hours, option for working from home some days", "cons": "Average salaries below market.
