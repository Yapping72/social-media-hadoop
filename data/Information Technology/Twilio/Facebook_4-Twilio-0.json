It hired and relocated people with families across countries 24 hours before then firing them. It fired unreachable people on PTO. It fired mothers currently on maternity leave (how's that for DEI?).

No I don't just write negative reviews, I make sure to always post positive reviews too.\n\nTwilio is a great company no doubt, Twilio India also could have been so much more, but they have completely messed it up, and if you are even a decent developer this will be a complete waste of your time.\n\n* First H stands for Horrible Pay/Salary Structure:\n 1. The pay here is so much less compared to all the other product companies in India.\n 2. Your package will have ~50% stocks, which is a big lossy deal(assuming you are in 30% tax bracket), as cash gets taxed at ~32% whereas your stock will get taxed at ~42%, plus the stocks of this company has wild volatility, for example it has lost almost $160+ per share in the last couple of months.\n 3. Increment is meager here, ranging from 4-8% in most of the cases.\n\n* Second H stands for Horrible Work:\n 1. Mostly maintenance kind of work comes in India, and it is mostly small changes and bugfixes, all the core challenging/interesting/business critical features are held in US offices.\n 2. Higher management will tell a bunch of lies during hiring to attract and recruit people, but it's just a bunch of lies.\n\n* Third H stands for Horrible Higher Management:\n 1. Twilio has a core value called \"No Shenanigans\", but the higher management in India are role models for just the exact opposite of it.\n 2. As I said above for lying during recruitment, they do the same for internal things, they hide and lie as long as they can, giving lame reasons later to cover it up.\n 3. All the false promises they give you during joining, they don't hold up any of them and later when asked they keep saying they are looking into it.\n\nEven if all these things are ok with you, you can for once think of joining Twilio India core. BUT there is another company called Segment which Twilio has recently acquired, and they have teams in India for the same, if you even remotely find out that you are being hired for Segment teams, run with all fours as fast as you can. There is a great deal of politics involved in this company between the higher management and you will just be the victim of it all the time.\n\nTo summarise, the purpose of this review was, I had been hiring engineers, and occasionally some of them will be really good, and it really hurts me to not being able to tell them about all this and they joining here and regretting later.\n\nSo I wanted this review to stand as an eye opener for them, and if not via this review, at least do your own research to connect with people from Twilio offline/via friends, and get to know what you are getting yourself into and then only join.\n\nHonestly until you fall into the category of people I mentioned in Pros, I think you will get far better companies to join in Bangalore than Twilio."}, {"review_title": "Perfect place to work for!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 May 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* Competitive compensation - Twilio always provides a market competitive compensation.\n* Unlimited PTO - It might be different team by team.

The mission is to \"change communications forever\", and unlike so many cliched mission statements, we've actually got a shot at making that happen. Businesses have launched based on the existence of programmable SMS. Women have been rescued out of sex-trafficking because they were able to text a shortcode for help. Folks living in poverty have have found public assistance that they wouldn't have otherwise discovered for lack of adequate internet access. \r\n\r\nBut if you're into building photo-sharing apps, you can do that too with MMS.\r\n\r\nWorking for a communications company allows you to impact nearly every sector of the economy. Something like 95% of Americans interacted with a Twilio phone number last year. And because the use-cases are so broad, we're constantly learning new ways that customers use our stuff (compare that to, say, an analytics company where there's more or less a singular purpose for your product). The customers and use-cases never get old. \r\n\r\nIt's good to feel that the work you do matters. \r\n\r\nThe people are great. I came from a small 30 person company where I had spent six years and I just assumed I'd never find that kind of kinship with a group of coworkers before. I'm remote, so my relationships are a bit different than most (more on that later), but every time I come back to HQ there are tons of hugs and smiles. Our engineering team is truly world class. Our facilities team executes at a level of excellence. The people here are genuinely kind, empathetic folks who care enough about their work to do it extremely well. \r\n\r\nThe company cares deeply about its people. Think this is evident if you chat with anyone from the E-Team face-to-face. The salary is competitive and the benefits are generous. The parental leave policy (4 months maternity, 3 months paternity) is industry leading. Un-tracked PTO is legit (though, I agree that calling it \"unlimited\" is a bit shennanigansy). I've taken up to six weeks off a year. At an all-hands last year Jeff (CEO) said, \"I just got back from two-weeks vacation. I say that not to brag but to tell you all to take vacation. We're playing the long game here.\" Last year we implemented mandatory vacation -- you have to take at least 5 continuous days off. \r\n\r\nThe company and leadership try hard to be on the right side of social issues. The E-Team has gone to great lengths to diversify the workplace. For instance: having women's leadership panels during all-hands, bringing in outside consultants to evaluate our workforce diversity and to reveal unconscious bias in the hiring process, encouraging the employee-led Skittles group, throwing a celebration with hundreds of cupcakes on the day marriage equality passed. Twilio.org was given a huge endowment (don't know if that's quite the right word but I'll use it) to affect social change. We supported efforts to call senators and congressmen to fight for net-neutrality and against internet surveillance. We publish a quarterly transparency report. We publicly sided with Apple in their latest battle with the FBI. \r\n\r\nJeff is an incredible leader. He is a battle-hardened visionary, an engaging public speaker and is capable of setting the mission and inspiring the troops. He's also a developer. Don't think the importance of that can be overstated for a company that builds tools for developers. Roy (COO) seems perfectly suited for his job as a nuts-and-bolts counterbalance to Jeff's role as visionary. More importantly, they are good men. This provides great assurance when issues come up that make you say, \"I'm not so sure about this...\" \r\n\r\nThat's not to say that mistakes aren't made or that the working environment is perfect or that there aren't weeks when we have to sacrifice quality of life for the sake of getting the work done. But it's so much easier to endure those issues when you can trust the character of the leaders and the mission of the work.", "cons": "You're going to work hard. There are often 50 hour weeks. Sometimes more. Tasks and job responsibilities aren't always clear. One of Twilio's core values is to \"Draw the Owl\" -- that is to say that there is no instruction book for many of the things we're trying to do. I put this in the \"cons\" because, while some people really dig this kind of environment, it's probably also the most common reason why folks quit. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for rigidly-defined roles and a 9 to 5 schedule, this won't be a good gig for you. Twilio's trying to brave new territory. There's no map. Sometimes we go the wrong direction and have to backtrack. Sometimes the trail is super bumpy. Sometimes the wagon tips over while fording a river. Sometimes people catch dysentery. It's the nature of going places no one has ever gone before and trying to get there before everyone else. Again, it's reassuring that the folks leading the expedition know (roughly) what they're doing and actually care about the people making the trip. But the ride's not always comfortable. If you're looking for things to complain about, you'll always find them. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the road to career growth isn't always apparent. I imagine that this in part stems from not knowing what roles we'll need two years down the line. I can name dozens of people promoted over the last few years, but I doubt many of them had that job in mind 12 months prior. In many cases, that job didn't even exist. Based on what I've seen, if you work hard and handle your workload, you'll gradually get more put on your plate. That \"more\" often evolves into a new position with a new title and new salary. \r\n\r\nThe remote experience isn't awesome. 75% of the company is colocated in SF so, naturally, a lot of the culture revolves around HQ. There are impromptu celebrations, social activities and hallway conversations that you'll miss out on if you're not at HQ. It's easy to feel like an outsider. It's a known problem that folks are actively trying to solve. We recently switched to a new video conference provider, have experimented with leading all-hands from remote locations, and surveys have gone out to ask remotes how we can improve. Company wide adoption of Slack last year helped a lot too. \r\n\r\nAll that said, collecting an SF salary while not living in SF is pretty cool. \r\n\r\nIf you live in the States and want to work in engineering, you'll have to work out of either the SF or Mountain View offices. It's a bit disappointing that we haven't figured out how to utilize a remote engineering team, but that does seem to be the norm. It does seem that we're improving as we now have engineering offices in Estonia and Bogota. But for the most part, if you're a developer, you must be willing to relocate to SF. \r\n\r\nWe've outgrown HQ. WiFi there is pretty bad. This is frustrating for remotes too as video conferences hang and drop. There aren't enough conference rooms and telephone booths, so there's often a lot of background noise on calls. These issues should be resolved when our new HQ opens. I haven't heard an official ETA yet, but I'm guessing early 2017 at the latest. \r\n\r\nThere seems to be a \"if you want to get something done, set a meeting\" culture at HQ and the open workplace is fairly distracting. I've certainly found it easier to put my head down and work while being remote. \r\n\r\nTwilio's certainly not a perfect place, but I think it's easy to get a warped perspective of what constitutes a \"normal\" work environment when you work in tech.  My guess is that if you took the average non-tech worker (or the average office worker from a generation ago) and dropped them into the Twilio office, showed them the benefits, showed them the culture, the free lunches, the stocked kitchen, the Wednesday night dinners, the track jacket ceremony and the $30/month Kindle reimbursement, they'd be astonished that workplaces like this exist. \r\n\r\nIt's worth tossing a disclaimer in there that I'm a remote employee working on one of the few fully-remote teams, and am largely shielded from the day-to-day BS that pops up at a company of Twilio's size.

If you\u2019re an engineer without a CS degree, particularly if you\u2019re a woman or POC, good luck finding people who are willing to give you the opportunity to grow (or an equal paycheck). There is no investment in growth, learning, or educational opportunities. Don\u2019t expect to be able to join a team like Customer Support or Sales Engineering and move into Engineering! You\u2019ll only be disappointed.\r\n\r\nManagement is a huge problem. There is an excessive number of managers, and many who are first time managers who run their teams without proper training and support. The managers who are good at their jobs typically juggle 2-3 teams at a time. The rest hold personal grudges and push out people who don\u2019t think exactly like them.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot of talk about being a DOer. Do the thing you want. Be the change you want to see. So there are a lot of motivated folks who work hard in their off hours to create programs that make the company look really good, but never get compensated for their time and efforts beyond a token thanks. So keep that in mind if you want to start a program within Twilio.\r\n\r\nTeam breakdown:\r\n\r\nThe Product department runs the show. R&D spends more time trying to churn out half-baked ideas than making thoughtful, careful decisions and investing in technical debt. Deployments take hours, sometimes even days. Engineering is so used to fire-fighting that there\u2019s little chance to think ahead and invest wisely in technical decisions.\r\n\r\nMarketing is constantly fire-fighting and trying to find its voice. After 8 years, the company still doesn\u2019t have a consistent message, target audience, or way to describe what it does. There\u2019s a high concentration of bros on one of the teams in Marketing.\r\n\r\nHR is a mess and completely out of touch with the rest of the company\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nSales is filled mostly with bros, although the BDR team and Sales Engineering seem to be heading in the right direction.\r\n\r\nCustomer Support is an old boy\u2019s club and everyone seems a little shellshocked at all times.\r\n\r\nFacilites is a gem, a diamond in the rough.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re remote, good luck! It\u2019s not going to be an easy road and nobody will care about what you need in order to do your job.\r\n\r\nThe Executive team is a mixed bag. Jeff, the CEO, is very passionate, but he\u2019s more interested in becoming the next Amazon instead of building a great Twilio. Lee is a great CFO and runs a tight ship in Finance. Roy is a big company executive in a small startup land. The two don\u2019t mix very well.\r\n\r\nOverall, the people are really great. The product is going places.

Why this still exists is a mystery, but I am sure the sense of entitlement they must feel every day is somehow gratifying in their day-to-day work life. These people are often untouchable, unapproachable, and condescending to deal with.\r\n\r\nWhile the engineering talent is tremendous, it's difficult to understand why so many failure points exist.

Think all the things you know and hate about big companies, he wants to avoid these. There is a strong emphasize on creating a family atmosphere: Twilio-Birthday parties, ThanksGiving dinners, Halloween costume contests, volunteering as a team and many more year round events. If you haven't yet realized the product is awesome and Twilio grows like crazy. There is also a strong desire for cultural diversity. If you always felt you are different from others, maybe even considered by some a little weird there is a good chance Twilio will hire you and you will have found a family at work. There is a lot of tolerance here. They hire almost only young people though, so be aware of that as well. People are trying hard to-do-the-right-thing beyond their jobs. Twilio for some is an attitude, an aspiration to make the world a better place ( Twilio volunteers, sponsored Hackathons, Twilio Fund, the Polaris project etc. )", "cons": "Jeff is a product person, an engineer. Engineering and product teams rule this company. I think Jeff also understands the value of support, albeit the support team is constantly overworked. They have tens of thousands of signups per month and these people want to be nourished and no matter how good the Tech Support leader is and how fast they hire they will always be behind. This is an API, not a product and as such many support questions tend to be very involved. \r\nGA and Sales is outsourced to the COO who tries to operationalize his value by introducing former colleagues and corporate rules from much bigger companies. \r\nGA ( HR and Finance ) are the same as everywhere. It's a big well oiled machinery. They have their rules and processes and do their work.\r\nIf you are in Sales you are pretty much screwed at Twilio. Sales strategy so far has changed every 6 months without measurable impact and they went through several leaders in the last couple years. The problem is that while Twilio is growing like crazy it does that without measurable impact by sales. For Twilio sales is a experiment and costly at that. \r\nThere had been quite some attrition in the sales team lately. I think these had been pretty good people who made or were close to making their numbers. They just realized that there is no career progress in a company where a sales person is shown as Bozo the clown.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the title of my review: If you want to join as support person you will either break or you turn into steel and can get a job anywhere after your Twilio life. If you want to be in GA ( HR, Finance etc.) Twilio is like any other place. Enjoy it while you are there and then move on.  If you want to be in an engineering or product role at Twilio this will be the job you will rave about for the rest of your life.

Teams (and colleagues) very frequently trash one another behind closed doors rather than practice empathy and collaboration.\r\n\r\nMy take? The highest levels of Engineering management are quite adversarial and stand-offish. I don't interact with them often but in the few meetings where I'm exposed to them it's awkward. The fish rots from the head down, and I can't help but wonder if they're responsible for the conflicts and promoting some of the poor relationships found amongst the teams.
