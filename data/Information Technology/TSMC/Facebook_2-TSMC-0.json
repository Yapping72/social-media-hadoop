There are pros and cons here like any other company. My first impression after three months at TSMC was feeling challenged but fulfilled. All challenges forced me to learn and understand the diversity in this company. I don't necessarily agree with the work culture 100% but I do respect the challenge that TSMC is facing in establishing a Fab in a foreign country from the ground up. If you like challenges and self-growth, TSMC will provide you with that in your career path plus great compensation and benefits.", "cons": "There were many unexpected tasks and responsibilities that popped up during my training in Taiwan. Luckily, I had great team support from both Taiwanese and my current teammates."}, {"review_title": "Proud to work for the most advanced semi company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Engineer in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1. Compensation: Great salary and bonuses. TSMC provides above-market pay (more than other semi-companies) for most of its employees including technicians, engineers, and managers. The relocation package they provided was over-the-top generous and really helped me settle into the greater Phoenix area 2. Corporate culture: feedback-heavy culture but emphasized commitment, low-key, and pursuit of excellence. It took me a little bit to get used to the \"continuous improvement\" culture of TSMC as you will always get more feedback than compliments in this company. It can be mentally tough in the beginning but will eventually build your character and force you to be the best version of your professional self. Commitment-wise, TSMC really emphasizes the value of keeping you word to your clients, suppliers, managers, and subordinates. This means going above and beyond for everything you promised to turn in. This can be very stressful at times but i grew tremendously under this corporate culture. Low-key, TSMC values humbleness and having a low-key attitude. Though with the good compensation, some of its entry-level employees and first-line manager can be seen as show-offs at times; the majority of management and senior leaders are humble and down-to-earth people that truly value integrity and doing the right thing. This also means giving out zero to nothing of press releases about any contribution TSMC provided. Lastly, the pursuit of excellence. This is very similar to the feedback culture, TSMC brings out the best of you by always chasing after excellence. From product quality, wafer yield, to any deliverable you have to hand in; this company asks you to turn in the best version possible. In all honestly, I believe that's what put TSMC above its competitors and what will help to continue its leadership. 3. Work & Career: being the most advanced semi-company and getting to work with the top silicon valley clients, like Apple, AMD, and Nvidia, all at once brings me excitement when going to work. Knowing that I am playing with the most advanced technology ever existed also challenges me to do better. No matter the scope of my job, I am constantly working with different equipment engineers, process engineers, and sometimes facility engineers to resolve probably the world's toughest problem.", "cons": "1. It is NOT EASY for a Taiwanese company (non-American companies) to build the most-advanced Fab with the largest capacity in the States. There is quite some work to be done to merge the two cultures. HR has already done a lot of professional development but you still see cultural clashes when working here. Taiwanese are not used to the innovative, work-smart-not-hard American working styles while American find Taiwanese can be condescending at times. These simply come from a lack of understanding of each other and differences in cultures of communication; both sides simply want to do well and achieve more (but simply using a different method) 2. Company sometimes gives more tolerance to senior employees who are out of time and incompetent. Keep them at their job simply for their seniority even though some can be useless. 3. Work-life balance. This is not just referring to work hours or work intensity. This means Taiwanese are used to making work a major portion of their lives, aka your friends are mostly work friends and you engage with your superior more in your downtime."}, {"review_title": "Hardly work life balance", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "10 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Principle Engineer in Tainan", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay in Taiwan.

This is to be expected. My trainer I think has definitely met me part way, and I believe I can say I have done the same. There's still a gap, but this can be worked on.", "cons": "The work culture in Taiwan is really different than in the US. I am sure TSMC will have to change to an 8 hour work day five days a week or do what other companies do with Fabs and run three days on, four days off, four days on, three days off rotations. As it is right now in Taiwan The minimum amount of time at the company is 10 hours a day, but realistically is running up to even 12 hours a day. This is for those of us who are American training to go back to the new operation in Arizona. The reality for people from Taiwan is that they are doing even more than 12 hour days often. There's also the night shifts and weekend shifts on duty and/or on call. That last part is understandable as the fab lives 24/7.\r\n\r\nThe training in this experience really depends on one person who is your \"trainer\". My experience has lacked any structure, but had no shortage of expectations. I came up with some process to approach learning new equipment and daily tasks, but to be honest don't know that I've arrived yet.\r\n\r\nTSMC doesn't seem to enshrine a sense of individual freedom. The company provides housing for those of us training from the states, but has very much micromanaged everything we do in our living arrangement. There's a curfew with no guests allowed for example.

Decent benefits. Opportunity to travel to Taiwan for training. They overvalue education here (pro if you have a higher degree, con if you don\u2019t). So if you have a PhD, this place will definitely overpay you for it and you start as a principal engineer. \n\nThe Taiwanese coworkers are great and I have made many life-long friends. The issues that I have with the company are with how the company is structured, and company culture, not necessarily with the people who work there.", "cons": "Let me start by saying that I was with the first batch of engineers that flew to Taiwan to be trained in advanced semiconductor technology so that we could then help open the fab in AZ. There is a large list of things to be critical of but I think the biggest issue is that there is no plan. From the beginning, it was clear that the company had no plan for what to do with us. We arrived and no critical document was in English (including basic SOPs or other instructions necessary to perform our job functions). So, they told us that we need to translate everything ourselves (although speaking Chinese was not a job requirement). As you might suspect, Google Translate is not the most effective tool when trying to translate important documents. I have been in Taiwan for over 14 months now and they still have yet to translate everything into English. Upon arrival, we also discovered that there really is no permanent seating for us. They didn\u2019t even try to set up a temporary spot for us. We kind of just had to squeeze between multiple of our colleagues and fight for space on a shared desk which is not equipped with any ergonomic equipment. Multiple people have already started complaining about neck, back, and wrist pain due to the poor seating arrangement. They try to integrate us into the Taiwan Fab, but it is near impossible with the language barrier. They make it very difficult for us to have access to the systems needed to do our jobs. To this day, I still don't have access to most critical systems that I need in order to perform my work. Our training is mostly dependent on what trainer we got. But most are too busy to actually train us. \n\nHR has admitted that they have very few actual company policies. This has led to them either deferring to Taiwan HR policies or just flat out making up policies on an employee by employee basis. The relocation package to Taiwan is absolutely horrific compared to what any other American company would provide and in many cases they misrepresented what the benefits were before we arrived in Taiwan. They only provide transporation to the fab during certain times during the day. We constantly have to beg just for them to pay for transportation to/from work if we have to take a half day or sick day. They stated that they only pay for a taxi for us to go home if we already worked longer than 12 hours that day (not to mention our housing is 1 hour away from the office so they are really asking for a 14-hour day). They make up covid policies on the spot and have kicked random people out of their housing if they get covid (and then a few weeks later will change the policy and try to hide it). They attempted to control our lives outside of work by controlling what other employees we can and cannot see (when there were only a few covid cases in the entire country). Our housing isn\u2019t equipped with drinkable water nor dryers in each unit. The housing that they showed us before we moved to Taiwan looked nothing like the housing we actually moved into. They didn\u2019t tell us until a year in that all tsmc rules at work also apply to our housing (they still have yet to officially admit that, presumably so that they can change rules as they see fit). They do not own the housing that we stay in and have yet to tell us why they are able to make up these random rules for our housing. For those that haven't been to Taiwan, understand that tsmc has so much influence that they can pretty much convince the landlords to follow any rules they set. I understand that living conditions are different here than in the US, but when you are asking employees and their families to upend their entire lives and move to another country for 2 years, you should at least try to make it appealing. An attempt has not even been made. \n\nEverything here is highly disorganized. There is very little documentation which makes it hard to replicate certain tasks (which would normally be pretty easy to replicate). Otherwise easy tasks turn into multiple hours of tracking down the right person who knows this specific information who then tells you to reach out to this person who is busy in a meeting so waiting another 1-2 hours before finally getting an answer and moving onto the next step.

This is because the extensive training period in Tainan lowered the barrier to entry.\n+ Taiwan is a beautiful country, and I am greatly appreciative of the time I have to explore it.", "cons": "- Wages: Employees at this company are underpaid relative to positions elsewhere in the industry. Taiwanese hires especially get the short end of the stick when it comes to salary, many getting paid less than half of their American-born counterparts in the same role. On top of this, TSMC overvalues degrees, and severely undervalues experience when determining wages. \n\n- Advancement: Management positions are reportedly not given to those without a masters degree, regardless of fit. some managers claim the benefits to Fab 21 is its opportunity for promotion, but others explain that promotion is unlikely.\n\n- Training Program: Often, trainings were hampered by Covid-19 in-person limitations and overloaded trainers. Local experienced engineers were not given a reduced workload to allow for time to build the training program, instead it was an additional task to be done in parallel. In addition, the trainees were often made to feel like the training was a barrier to navigate when completing their assigned tasks, resulting in minimal effort on both sides.\n\n- Work Culture: Projects are often adversarial, rather than cooperative, racing on tasks to claim credit. It is not uncommon to discover multiple other individuals were working on your project in parallel after the fact. Employees very often have tasks stolen from them without their knowledge, wasting their time and losing their credit. \n\nInterdepartmental relations are especially adversarial. The roles of Manufacturing, Integration, Yield, and Module are inherently antagonistic to each other by design. Information is often withheld and obfuscated, and communication is ignored. The excuse often given is IP, but the truth is the more you share, the more the other department will use against you in the future.\n\nRegarding management, it often feels like most of the friendliness and offers for help can be lip service. I have observed coworkers bringing complaints to management regarding work-related health issues, obstinate teammates, and overloading that were not fully addressed, and sometimes shrugged off. Employees are often left to sort out their own problems.\n\n- Work/Life Balance: Early on during my stay in Taiwan, there was a presentation in which someone told us that, \"It is not about balancing work and life, its about finding a way to live through your work.\" This about sums it up, as the hours prohibit you from living anywhere other than inside the Fab. I cannot stress to you enough how brutal the work/life balance is here. \nI know people who slept in the office for a month straight. 12 hour days are standard, weekend shifts are common. Many locals come in on the weekends even when they're not scheduled, just to catch up on the work that their 60+ hours that week could not cover. TSMC provided its AZ hires lodging during their \"training\" stay, but failed to mention during the interview process that it would be an hour commute. This turns 60+ hours of work into 70 hours of time sunk into the company.\nEven meals are often not sacred, It is stressed to employees that they are not to eat away from their desk, and that they are not to talk to each other during meals, under threat of lower performance reviews. \nIt is common to receive work calls in the middle of the night, or 6am on the weekends, and so even when you leave the company, you must keep your phone with you at all times.\n\n- Human Resources: Understandably, they work on behalf of the company. Less understandably, it seems that they work against the employees. Policies change on email by email bases and differ by sender, recipient, and hiring date. Important information is often danced around with vague and indirect language that leaves many in the dark, and requests for transparent baseline policies are met with directions to send an email that will be ignored. one incident like this can be forgiven, a few can be seen as incompetence, but operation to this degree feels almost malicious. Part of the strain with HR is a result of their high turnover, causing remaining employees to be overloaded and have less patience. \n\nA few months into our stay, HR pushed us to sign a document saying we would pay the company roughly $20k USD. They claimed this was to \"prevent us from paying taxes any differently than we would in the States,\" regardless of the fact that this payment was not to the government. When resisted, they attempted to claim it was mandatory. We had multiple info sessions with contracted accountants in which they would explain how most of us would definitely lose money to TSMC by signing the form, but TSMC still recommended it. We were told the money would help \"compensate TSMC for training expenses.\" Many trainees preferred to give HR the benefit of the doubt until this point.\n\nOverall, I'm incredibly disheartened. I was very excited to learn about the cutting edge technology we create here, and I really have met some terrific coworkers. The hardest part has been seeing all those friends lose excitement alongside me."}, {"review_title": "Good money but no work life balance", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.

I even heard some managers told engineers that you are spending long hours in the office just like other competitors BUT working on something better\u2026one thing that TSMC really stood out in this game is purely because Taiwanese engineers work extremely hard to fulfill the household needs in Taiwan. From my point of view, the success is not driven by problem solving mindset, learning attitude, or fast pace environment; the success is mostly because Taiwan probably has one of the most disciplined engineers in the world that barely share their thoughts when they disagree on something or feel something isn\u2019t done right, and this is the culture difference that people in Taiwan need to accept. Being proud of such culture will only make the way to US harder, believe it or not.\n\nPerhaps TSMC in Taiwan is one of the best so they never really think about themselves when it comes to employee retention, but they forgot that there are tons of companies here in the US just as good and big revenue wise as TSMC. \n\nI understand it\u2019s manufacturing, there\u2019s certain level of discipline needs to be in place but again I am not talking about the hours, I am talking about the mindset, the leadership mindset of adopting new culture."}, {"review_title": "Working in CIM is like in hell", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Aug 2022", "job_title": "CIM Engineer in Taichung", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "$$$$$$. They can only put your money in front of you, but it might less if you're good enough.", "cons": "1. Managers don\u2019t know the software and don\u2019t understand how the program works properly\n2. No development chance for engineers to learn the new technology and to improve the efficiency for work\n3. No career plan for engineers to help engineer grow, there are only many ARs (action requests) to ask engineers work very hard to fulfill the requirements from users.\n4. Managers don\u2019t care your life, they only care their reputation and their performance in the higher management. They even ask engineers to work very late to deliver what they want.\n5. Still use Delphi 7 (yes, Delphi 7 not the 8 or 200X or XE or 10.) which should be retired in the present day for the reports and agents.\n6. Very unstable middleware to the database. It\u2019s written in Delphi 7 with DCOM. I don\u2019t know how to criticize this point, it is very unbelievable to happen in a \u201csoftware department\u201d. Nowadays, it should be something written in Java, C# or Go. Even Python might be faster and stabler than Delphi 7.\n7. Every project came and sunset soon once it got credits, they claim they resolve a lot of issues happening in the factory, but it won\u2019t last too long because people need to accomplish another thing before the next performance evaluation, so their best strategy is to sunset the system they just delivered.\n8. Although it\u2019s CIM, the \u201cdata science\u201d team is the most comfortable team to stay because they don\u2019t need to be on-call and to own the programs which may cause issues for the products. Plus, they usually have good performance because their work can highlight people to do and make actual credit from that.\n9. Don\u2019t have system design meeting, code review and endorsement meeting for publish as a software department. Instead, you need to have a lot of signatures/approvals from users and managers to let you publish new programs on the production environment. Once issues happen, managers only care the impact scope and ask you fix it ASAP. They don\u2019t want to be responsible for your work.\n10. Engineers in CIM need to be multiple roles i the same time. You need to be RD, QA, DevOps and PM by yourself because managers don\u2019t show up in the meeting with users and you need to face them by yourself. They are only aware of that you\u2019re doing some projects when users are requesting something.\n11. Unbalanced workloads between engineers. Performant engineers usually have a lot of applications to own. That is, you need to work from 8 to 22 to have meetings, tracing bugs and developing something new. However, the engineers with lower productivity or high chance to make mistakes don\u2019t get work. They can just go office at 8:30 and leave the office at 17:30. In total, bad money drive out good.\n12. Sometimes, you may find the CIM managers just a person with mouth and no any real know-how to guide you and help you in the work. They act like emotional animals to ask you do anything they want. For example, one manager don't know how the function works in their project with the energy statistics or Docker, but he always ask people to use these 2 things to complete projects, then he can get the credit.\n13. Engineers need to share machines instead of having a PC for your own.\n14. Good engineers are leaving one by one, and there are almost no good engineers leaving."}, {"review_title": "Rich", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Equipment Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Busy and very busy together", "cons": "Work time could be shorter"}, {"review_title": "Na", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Taipei", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High salary with skilled coworker", "cons": "Long work hour and no life"}, {"review_title": "No", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Hsinchu", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Have much learning resources available", "cons": "Can not use your phone Web not very well"}, {"review_title": "great pay.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Oct 2022", "job_title": " in Anthem, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "state of the art facility.", "cons": "long working hours that are spent with little downtime"}], [{"review_title": "Equipment Engineer", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Equipment Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary, no more pros", "cons": "High pressure, long working hours"}, {"review_title": "None", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Goody pay and well reputation", "cons": "Too busy to feel exhausted everyday"}, {"review_title": "Good salary", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Sr. Engineer in Hsinchu", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary with long work time", "cons": "long work time and high pressure"}, {"review_title": "TSMC Equipment Engineer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Equipment Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "money money money money money", "cons": "Shift work required\uff0chigh pressure\uff0cboring\uff0cno freedom"}, {"review_title": "TSMC", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "DTP:\u3000Long working hours, monthly design bonus", "cons": "DTP (Library design kit methodology development )"}, {"review_title": "Shift work", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Equipment Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Convenience Reduced amount of working hours Training prospects Avoid peak hours Flexibility", "cons": "Abnormal routine Shift inequality Work imbalance Health issues Conflicts with family"}, {"review_title": "Process Engineer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Principal Engineer in Hsinchu", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Relatively high salary in Taiwan", "cons": "High pressure and work time"}, {"review_title": "With out personal time, working all day long.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Integration Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary is not bad, it's satiable for who needs rapid wealth.", "cons": "Working hours are too long, will impact health and personal time."}, {"review_title": "Friendly relationship", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "8 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice working environment in my department and reasonable work load.", "cons": "Company system security cause user not convenient."}, {"review_title": "Long working hours", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Process Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Relatively higher salary in Taiwan.", "cons": "Work more than 12 hours a day quite often.
