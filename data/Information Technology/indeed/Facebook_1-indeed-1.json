They were just voted a great place to work for women. Why?  Because of a generous maternity policy, I would assume.  They didn't even mention women in their write-up about it which is exactly appropriate for the situation. The ranking is smoke and mirrors. There are no women in the C suite and the smartest VP's leave for the C suite elsewhere. There are lots of men who think they are really smart, and most of them are, but the smartest leaders are the ones who admit and act upon diverse solutions. \r\nThere are women on the service teams and a few other departments who are promoted and very few \"friends of the family\" who they know they can control. Women in sales who have moved up recently had another layer placed over their head. They are now pretty much at the same level they were but with even less power because of the additional male-dominated team put above them. Talk about a rock and a hard place. \r\n\r\nTech teams are untouchable even when a client has valid issues. This creates unbelievable expectations on the sales team to keep the client happy, with no power, while your quota and livelihood is tied to this insanity.\r\n\r\nEverything operates in a shroud of mystery. They intentionally keep departments away from each other and their favorite word to a client need is \"no\". Be prepared for more NO than you have ever experienced before. It took me 4 months to figure out pricing because there is no pricing. It is \"what can you get out of your customers\" which is why I think this shroud exists and quite frankly, working.\r\n\r\nBonus plans are paid instead of commissions.  In the beginning, this seems cool, until you realize that for the amount of product you are selling, it is very subpar to industry standards, you can't help but realize you are being bilked.  Especially when there were bonus bumps after ample service but they seem to have been done away with that with recent management changes. Last note on bonus over the commission structures that most salespeople are accustom to. Commissions are protected by law, bonus payouts are not.  This means that as soon as you sell something on commission, you are owed that commission by law.  Bonus is never required to be paid out, they will use this to their advantage and not yours.\r\n\r\nBase Pay: good when you 1st evaluate it.  Once you get in you realize they are paying less experienced, worse performers, more. My assessment is because they are male. You are \"forbidden to discuss pay rates\", though by law, you are allowed to and it is illegal for them to tell you that you can fire you for it.  Look it up! They can be heavily fined for this practice if someone decides to go after them.  Hello Lilly Ledbetter!\r\n\r\nUnlimited PTO:  Again this looks great on the surface. Who wouldn't want that!?! It is actually a catch 22.  It is very enticing until you want to use it. When I put in for less PTO than I had taken the year before unlimited PTO change, I was chastised for abusing the policy. It all comes down to your manager.  Additionally, if you accrue PTO, when you leave, they have to pay that out to you.  They do not with an unlimited plan.\r\n\r\nGoal setting: An unspoken mystery of how they produce your goal for the quarter.  Supposedly with \"algorithms\" and other voodoo magic. The rumor is the finance team does it- like they have any clue what your clients will be up to that quarter. Then it is handed to the sale managers where they have the liberty to adjust the number to each member of their team. (I'm not sure even they know how the initial numbers are produced. ) Soooo the top performers are almost always getting exceedingly high expectations because they work themselves to death to hit them and the not so top performers barely grow their territories. At the end of the quarter, both top, and not so top, are paid almost the same bonus with a few percentage point changes to make it less obvious... It's awesome... yeah right.  \r\nSales industry norms are that teams hit quota 65-75% of the time. Anything more is too easy, anything less, too hard. At Indeed, if you don't hit quota 100% of the time, you risk going \"on plan\". Another recent development since management change this past year. They use this form of punishment arbitrarily.  If they like you and you keep hitting 90-95% of your goal, your cool.  No worries.  If they don't like you and you hit 95-99%, you could be in trouble or made to feel unwanted. Which as salespeople know is usually the same end result. Recently, a manager really liked their employee but senior management decided it was their time to go.  He intruded on the relationship until the employee had no choice but to leave. Good times!\r\n\r\nWork/life balance: If you let it, Indeed will work you to death. If you don't care as much and everyone really likes you, you can live it up fairly cush and just keep hanging. I worked so hard, and everyone really liked me, and I really liked them, but I just couldn't do another year of it. They pushed me until I broke, because I cared, exceeded my goals, and was the positive life of the party.  Unfortunately, as soon as you start to feel less taken care of by your employer than you are taking care of them, it's hard to get back from burnt."}, {"review_title": "10/10", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 May 2021", "job_title": "Content Acquisition Associate in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture, support, targets, free snacks and lunch on fridays", "cons": "No cons - it was great"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 May 2021", "job_title": "Account Executive in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supportive environment, great culture, happy", "cons": "None, great place to work"}, {"review_title": "Great Environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Senior Account Executive in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Senior leadership is very transparent and always keeps us updated on where the company is going and improvements that are taking place for our clients or job seekers and what steps we're taking to continue to improve.\r\n\r\nI can honestly say I enjoy working with all of my colleagues and everyone wants to help you to be successful.\r\n\r\nBig team environment where inclusion is the driving factor.\r\n\r\nI love working here and feel very valued as an individual!\r\n\r\nThanks Indeed!!!\r\n#wehelppeoplegetjobs", "cons": "Not being able to be in the office right now with my teammates and coworkers!"}], [{"review_title": "People in Indeed", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 May 2021", "job_title": "Account Manager in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great facilities and the people are nice", "cons": "KPI's but they were fair"}, {"review_title": "Nice and Chill", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 May 2021", "job_title": "Client Success Specialist in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Really good environment and good people.", "cons": "The work itself could get really repetitive"}, {"review_title": "Great benefits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Open communication, weekly Q&A since wfh because of covid-19, one you day every month shortly after wfh starts.", "cons": "Experience can vary considerably depending on your immediate manager."}, {"review_title": "Working at Indeed", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 May 2021", "job_title": "Account Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great team to work with", "cons": "Pay is below average for the industry"}, {"review_title": "Love working here!!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 May 2021", "job_title": "Account Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Culture & Pay!!

The recruiting blitz is strong and they strive for a 6 star experience if you make it to an interview. Salaries are toward the lower end from what I heard and what I learned as a hiring manager although manages are not allowed to know what their employees earn. They strive to make up for lower salaries in perks. (Not sure how that is going in these wfh days.) For a while, they were hiring like gangbusters with new employees getting a fresh Macbook Air. So you have a lot of young people without much structure running around looking busy but without much direction or results. The demographics and age range definitely slants younger and there is a lot 'coaching' asked of managers. There is also an emphasis in performance management with repeated feedback both up and down. However, this gives a disproportionate amount of leverage to lower level staff who in many ways have become entitled and coddled. And too many avenues for people to push back on their managers covertly. This creates a very superficial environment with happiness on the outside but a lot of back stabbing behind the scenes. It's unfortunate as the mission and progressiveness of the company are in the right place. The Indeed brand and marketplace standing are strong and the Japanese holding company who owns Indeed is throwing money at it like it's going out of style. (This must be a classic pump and dump strategy to sell this firm.)\r\nI would avoid jobs in program management as they are frequently glorified admins.

This was presumably because I made them feel threatened in some way, judging by how their white friends were promoted over me. Of course, both of these managers were white.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of Seen by Indeed, it was called Indeed Prime, and run by people who retaliated against POC who dared to give the leaders of the product a presentation about why targeting diverse candidates and people of color specifically was a solid business strategy that was already being pursued by our main competitor, Hired. It was a no-brainer, but since we gave the presentation to fragile white people, the result was retaliation in the form of verbal or managerial sidelining. Our personalities were proclaimed to be aggressive. The white man I worked for on Indeed Prime actually told me that my co-workers had given him feedback that I was aggressive and needed to tone down my personality - straight out of the racist workplace playbook. This same manager also mocked the accents of offshore contractors in front of me, about which HR did nothing. That manager later moved to a job in the Recruiting department, and is probably still there, because Indeed protects abusive, racist people, and really loves protecting bad managers with multiple HR complaints against them.\r\n\r\nThat was just the beginning. In both of my roles there, I was given work far beyond the scope of my job description. Forget a raise, I had to FIGHT for a title change to one that described all the work I actually did. Neither time did I actually get a title change, either. I moved to a different department for the next two of my three years at this company, and came across the second abusive manager, a white woman, who proceeded to hire another white woman who was her friend, who then bullied a third white woman on my team. Bullying is intersectional.\r\n\r\nBy the end of my tenure at Indeed, I had gone to HR about three separate white people who had bullied me in various documented ways, and HR did nothing. They claimed to do an investigation, but no one was fired, or even reprimanded, or prevented from getting a different role at Indeed. I'm always going to carry resentment from my time there because of the abusive behavior that's tolerated. The last straw was the Director of Diversity and Inclusion leaving. Y'all know why that was."}, {"review_title": "unemployed", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Graduate Fresher in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good job profiles for everyone", "cons": "the responses from the recruiters are late"}, {"review_title": "Dissappointing", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Account Executive in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Food, Happy Hours, Team events, location.", "cons": "Micromanaged, Controlled, not able to sell properly, terrible management shooting from the hip"}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Account Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for", "cons": "No cons to report here"}, {"review_title": "5", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Roustabout in Visakhapatnam", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Exlent indeed job opportunity world", "cons": "Nice opportunity in job position"}, {"review_title": "Great place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People and benefits and the amount of exposure", "cons": "Not enough balance with life and work and work and life"}], [{"review_title": "Cool place", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Account Executive in Stamford, CT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Unlimited PTO they actually want you to take time, company culture", "cons": "Young management, Closed book selling no opportunity to bring on your own clients"}, {"review_title": "Okay", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Account Manager in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Okay to work for now", "cons": "No work life balance for sales"}, {"review_title": "Team Lead", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Team Leader in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, Career Progression, unlimited PTO", "cons": "Not much to complain about"}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Account Executive in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazin co-workers, solid bonus compensation", "cons": "Low base salary, Very repetitive"}, {"review_title": "Would not recommend", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Recruiter in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent benefits, Nice office, some nice colleagues", "cons": "Poor management, micromanagement culture, sexism, discrimination, politics.

Let me start by saying, I have worked at Indeed for many years and I have yet to meet another black person who doesn\u2019t feel similarly to the things I will say in this post. I will also say, there aren\u2019t a lot of black employees at Indeed, so if you\u2019re black and looking to join Indeed, don\u2019t expect to see anyone that looks like you and don\u2019t expect the company to listen to what you have to say. Because we are the smallest minority, Indeed disregards us in favor of more \u201cpopular\u201d minorities. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, every single day, black employees have to pretend to be someone we\u2019re not so we are easier to digest for the vast majority of white people that run the company. That means, we oftentimes have to water down our personalities so we don\u2019t come off as \u201ctoo much\u201d for the white people we interact with. For example, if we push for our message to get across, we\u2019re aggressive, not assertive. If we question a decision, we\u2019re uncollaborative, not inquisitive. If we tell our manager we disagree with them, we\u2019re uncontrollable, not providing feedback. \r\n\r\nWe have to work three times as hard to be considered on the same level as white employees who don\u2019t care about their job. We also have to be hyper-aware of our emotions and how we are being perceived because we are always one mistake away from being labeled an angry black wo/man or a ratchet hoodlum. It\u2019s truly exhausting.\r\n\r\nSecond, I would guess 90% of managers at Indeed have never interacted with black people before and have developed their understanding of black people and black culture based on what they see on TV. In turn, they make assumptions about our interests and how they think they can relate to us. Most of which are grossly wrong. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, managers are never taught to manage different types of people, so they manage how they want to manage, instead of how their employees want to be managed. Keep in mind, a majority of Indeed employees are referrals. Who do people refer? Their friends and network. Most Indeed employees are like-minded people with a frat-boy mentality who are incentivized to perform better with promises of happy hours where they can get \u201cwhite-girl wasted.\u201d Also, because most of Indeed\u2019s employee base consists of these types of people, they\u2019re more likely to become managers and work their way up the ranks. \r\n\r\nImagine being a black person who didn\u2019t grow up with a frat boy mentality. Imagine being managed by a person who only knows how to socialize and interact with those types of people. Black employees do our best to shift the way we work so we fit in, but at what point will Indeed say enough is enough and be okay with accepting us as is? Why are only black employees changing how they act to fit in? Shouldn\u2019t managers be doing their best to cater their management style based on the preferences of the employee? The company really needs to invest more time and money into diversity management immediately.\r\n\r\nThird, the company refuses to acknowledge current events that affect their black employee base, but are quick to act when a more digestible group, for example the LGBTQ community, is affected. I am writing to let Indeed know that your black employees were and are still scared from all the deaths that happen in our community, the protests against us, the vocal hatred of us simply because of the color of our skin. We wanted something from you, an email, a note, something. You didn\u2019t even have to address the entire company in a message to us. You only had to talk to us, your black employees. \r\n\r\nIt breaks my heart to say Indeed was and continues to be silent and pretends that what happens in the world of black people, doesn\u2019t affect Indeed. Newsflash: if it affects your employees, it affects Indeed. \r\n\r\nFourth, our company is scared of the word \u201cdiversity\u201d and only wants to focus on the word \u201cinclusion.\u201d Fine, but how do you get to inclusion without there being a diverse employee base? I have seen with my own eyes new offices open up and immediately get filled with all white people. Those were opportunities to build diverse (excuse me, inclusive) offices from the ground up, but of course, Indeed failed to realize that. No matter how successful Indeed sees those offices, to me, they will always be a failure because they are not reflective of the diverse work force we\u2019re supposedly trying to help get jobs. \r\n\r\nWe spend a majority of our time at work. Do you know how frustrating it is to be surrounded by people who don\u2019t look like you for 40 hours a week? Do you know how frustrating it is to worry that you can\u2019t relate to anyone on your team because your tastes in music, TV, activities, are vastly different? Do you know how frustrating it is that jokes you sometimes make fall on deaf ears because they didn\u2019t grow up black and can\u2019t relate to or identify with what you\u2019re saying? For white people, you don\u2019t know how frustrating it is because you are the majority at Indeed. \r\n\r\nFifth, and my final point, Senior leadership seems to only focus on women when they define any issue with inclusion. They have made it one of, if not their main, priority in attracting a more inclusive workforce to Indeed. While I am all for women\u2019s rights, as a black person, it is incredibly disappointing to see the company prioritize one minority over another and pitch it as more important. Indeed has also never officially recognized blacks as a minority. In speeches, Senior leadership has mentioned a lack of women, initiatives with LGBTQ, but nothing about blacks. It\u2019s like \u201cblack\u201d is such a sensitive word and they\u2019d rather dance around it than come out and say it. \r\n\r\nI will say, people love working for Indeed, and I truly want to be one of those people again. I used to be, but my pride in this company has dwindled so dramatically over the years as my voice, and the voice of other blacks within the company, are ignored. When Indeed asks if I would recommend a friend to work here, my answer is always a firm \u201cno.\u201d My friends are black and I would never suggest they join a company where they will feel isolated, unwanted, and easily replaced. \r\n\r\nTo my fellow black Indeedians, I STAND WITH YOU AND I AM PROUD OF YOU. I know Indeed is scared of saying that so I wanted to make sure you heard it from someone who recognizes you for who you are - a strong, resilient people. \r\n\r\nTo Indeed, I know change doesn't come overnight.

I know of people who are running a referral side-business, basically using their connections with hiring managers to push their own people in and get referral bonuses. \r\n\r\nNo one in Indeed will care about the job being done well more than about their own well-being. If managers and directors are comfortable in their roles, why would they disrupt anything or improve the way things are done? This results in them also hiring and promoting people with a submissive mentality who never challenge authority. The constant calls for providing \"honest\" and \"anonymous\" feedback are just a cover as I've had honest constructive feedback come back to haunt me and severely damage my chances at growing here. Once management doesn't like you, you are done.\r\n\r\nSalary and benefits: Indeed pays below the average salaries of its competitors and they don't even provide free lunch every day (only on Wednesday but, if you are in Client Services, you also get lunch on Monday and Thursday \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af )\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a job that challenges you, gives you interesting projects to work on, managers who develop you, coach you, and care about you, or a professional working environment that you can take seriously, stay away from Indeed at the moment.\r\n\r\nIf you miss high-school and the rumours, back-stabbing, relationship-centric environment where sucking up to the right people is the only guarantee for success, you'll fit right in.

Here is an unbiased review of Indeed:\r\n\r\nI worked at Indeed for about 2 1/2 years in the San Mateo office and recently decided to leave when my maternity leave was up (probably outing myself here).  I left not because I was unhappy, quite the opposite.  But I crunched the numbers of what I would be making coming back and having to build business again verses what I would need to support my new family, and it just didn't add up.  I also felt stuck professionally since I had stopped believing that I would ever be able to move up at Indeed, no matter how well I did (and I did pretty well).  I would have gladly taken on more responsibility if they had given me the chance.\r\n\r\n  Most of the bad reviews on here I would have agreed with a year ago, BUT management has made a big effort to improve employee morale once they found out how unhappy a lot of people were. Outings and team building events are big here and I think management tries to nip most morale issues in the bud before they get bad.\r\n\r\nA big Pro here is that they do hire fantastic people to work with.  My former team especially seemed to gel, and I loved coming to work mostly because I enjoyed being around them.   My direct manager had a knack for hiring awesome people, and he was also honest with me about what I needed to improve on and what I did well.  I also credit the senior manager for really turning the San Mateo office around, he made it his personal mission to whip the office into shape and I think he succeeded.  \r\n\r\nAnother Pro is that Indeed does have a great product that works.  It's something that you can feel good about selling because it has value to HR professionals and most that try it are happy they did.\r\n\r\nMost people leave Indeed at the year mark, but if you stick it out, you can easily become proficient at your job and learn to work smarter.  You don't have to \"biz rule\" people and can instead rely on referrals and upsells for most of your quota attainment.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this is NOT a bad job.  It's sales, so at times it can be cutthroat and stressful, but what sales job is easy?  Rely not just on your manager but feel free to ask your team for help, most team members take pride in helping one another be successful.", "cons": "No room for advancement and can be a little frat house-y.  If you are out of college, you will make enough so you can support yourself, but if you have a family, you won't make enough unless you move up, which is extremely difficult.  There is a reason why lots of new parents have to leave Indeed, which is pretty sad.\r\nThe 60 call a day rule is good for newbies that are starting out, but senior reps who sell bigger deals should focus on longer conversations, less calls.  This is the only company I have ever worked for that has a \"one size fits all\" approach to how they manage new and senior people.\r\nDo not work here if you have a stick up your a**.  There is no HR in the San Mateo office for a reason, half of the people there would be fired multiple times over for violations, and I'm including myself here.

If your book is trash, youre just screwed.\r\n\r\nManagement is THE DEFINITION of micromanagement.

Understanding that as a company has significant growth, it's going to change, I am still saddened by the direction Indeed is headed. \r\n\r\nThere are many reasons Indeed is a strong competitor in this industry; primarily being it's large share of traffic compared to it's competitors. I always loved sharing with my customers the many perks Indeed offers for free over it's competitors.  However, in the past year or two, I've seen Indeed take the wonderful perks and monetize them. In addition, it seems that Indeed is also starting to use some of the pricing models as our competitors. While I understand some of the reasoning behind it, I feel like there are drastic changes that are so far from what Indeed was as a company and what we always said set us apart from our competitors.\r\n\r\nIndeed always had two core products, resume and job for many years. In the past few years, they've rolled out so many product to dominate the market. However, this fast progression is concerning when things are rolled out too early, leaving customers unhappy and your support teams having to be the face of the company in messy situations.\r\n\r\nI would love to see Indeed hire more experienced talent to help build a stronger foundation. Most of the higher level employees are in their positions because of the length of time they've been with the company, having luck with being in the right place at the right time, or due to favoritism.  I think the company, especially the San Mateo office, can use a stronger foundation in hopes that this will help with retention. The turnover rate is extremely high which can be disheartening to a team when it's constantly losing team members. There seems to be a continuous cycle of team members leaving, causing the rest of the team to have a heavy workload while managers frantically try to hire quickly and train a new hire to help lessen the workload while their team is drowning. At some points in my career at Indeed, it became embarrassing to take on an account from someone who had left and introduce myself to a customer knowing they had probably gone through several CS members in a short period of time while we were back-filling the former rep's position.\r\n\r\nI would also like to take the time to acknowledge the CS teams in San Mateo. While most are young - I would say that a majority of them work their butts off to do  the best with whatever situation they're put in.  My wonderful team members are what kept me at Indeed for as long as I did and was the sole reason that made it hard for me to leave. I would love to see the company make changes to their compensation. Especially for the Bay Area, Indeed is not competitive. We are constantly told that Indeed does market research and their compensation levels are competitive.  I just don't see how this can be true. While they once used to negotiate salaries, it seems that starting a couple years ago they moved to a model where if you are going for X role, you can only make up to $X.  One of the reasons I chose to leave was due to compensation.  After being promoted a few times, I knew that based on their new salary model, I was already making above what the promoted role would offer - therefore, I really couldn't make any more money at Indeed. I know this because I saw this happen to many of my tenured colleagues.

Then how do you expect me to understand the processes? I wasn't asking her to teach me to use a computer, and this wasn't something I could just look up on the Internet. I was asking her to help me understand the processes so that I could be a more useful team member and do well at my job. And if it isn't your job to teach, it should be considered your job to help ensure that a team member is trained properly. And if that is too much to ask for, you shouldn't be in a supervisory role. It is mind boggling and beyond comprehension that this was refused. Even the worst boss I had prior to this jerk didn't refuse to help me get up to speed on what was needed to do my job well. This horrible excuse for a boss did teach me one thing though. She taught me what a truly toxic work situation was all about. I had never been in such a situation before; hopefully, I never will be again.\r\n\r\nThat said, I observed teams and team leaders around me, and they seemed to enjoy genial chemistry and were having fun.

If you are looking for a shoe-in at a growing company and plan to eventually transfer departments, I pray you think again. There is no horizontal mobility unless you want to go to QA (for the same sub-organization) or coast until your next outside opportunity arises. Oftentimes other departments will ignore an internal applications simply based on their team of origin. Even then, it is up to the manager's discretion and not truly weighted on one's technical ability, subject matter expertise, or any equitable merit.\r\n\r\nSome general takeaways from the experience: \r\n\r\n* Hiring process/Promotions: They both tended to be quite nepotistic. Friends will be promoted while hard workers simply keep doing just that--working hard.\r\n\r\n* Personal career development: You will not have any opportunity to grow outside of the canned \"Analyst > Senior Analyst > Team Lead\" path. Total absence of guidelines for internal mobility around the Indeed corporate structure. Self-education is encouraged outside of work only and the internal learning seminars are nothing more than a bunch of engineers/devs showing off some cool things they made that will most likely never be introduced in the actual live site.\r\n\r\n* Overall professionalism/job specs: There isn't any formal discipline that 'search quality' can fall under, so the backgrounds in this department range from Art History to Zoology. While that isn't in itself a con, barely anyone has any technical knowhow coming in, despite asking for \"Python skillz\" on all the job adverts. This leads to managers being overly selective in the hiring process, with hopes that someone will help. Meanwhile, analysts drone on day in and day out on highly repetitive tasks that would frankly be more suited for outsourcing.\r\n\r\n* Social environment: While the majority of the coworkers you will get along with, a small fraction of hypersensitive employees will not let you forget that you are in the moral minority if you don't think like them. These individuals turn the workplace into an cautious, queasy environment where even the slightest annoyance could land you an HR complaint. Managers tend to sidestep the problem with fear of more HR complaints, this is a negative feedback loop. Seemingly weekly themed happy hours are cool though...\r\n\r\n* Management style: Laissez faire management is a tech industry mantra it seems, it works GREAT when your team is inspired by what they do. In reality managers at Indeed have no real top-level direction and typically just take the first idea that gets bubbled up from below. 'Metrics' and 'statistics' are dirty, dirty words around these here parts.\r\n\r\n* Last but not least--Salary: Well below average for the Austin area, as well as the tech industry in general. They'll try to doll it up like \"But we have open PTO! and food! and even kegs!\"--these things do nothing to detract from the lack of direction and personal growth you will experience taking a job here. The bonus schemes are cryptic and pretty much just rely on how well your team lead likes you any given quarter.\r\n\r\nAll Indeed truly has going for them is branding."}, {"review_title": "Otherwise great place to work ruined by anti-gun politics", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Sept 2019", "job_title": "SWE in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay, great benefits, great work/life balance, and interesting work.

Don't count on your bonus, because they will even cite vaguely worded attitude issues to limit your bonus. Basically - if you are successful your goals will be lifted to impossible standards sooner or later.\r\n- Lack of strategy. The company seems to be jumping from here to there constantly, I never saw a coherent strategy that gave me confidence that Indeed can be successful even when Google and Facebook enter the market\r\n- Bro culture across the board, made worse by perks being more tailored to that audience, not the female or older workforce. Diversity initiatives are in place and driven by great people, but Indeed's biggest diversity issue is an extremely young, male-centric culture, with little room for parents, women, minorities (I found the review further down from a black employee\u2019s perspective very accurate!)\r\n- Insane micro management. I've never experienced anything even close to this. Seems to be happening across all departments.

Rules are consistently thrown to the wayside by AE's and Directors turn a blind eye. \r\n\r\nWhile on a sales call, you're conditioned to think about what's best for you as a salesperson. Not the client. Not the jobseeker. If someone turns you down, you'll be asked to call them back again and ask why- you're to question their honest responses and disrespect their requests to cease contact. And when you move on from that opportunity, another AE will give that client a call right away, with the same script in hand. \r\n\r\nAs you could imagine, this leads to a place where our clients do not trust us- some have a new 'dedicated rep' each week. With no pricing information available anywhere else but on the phone with an AE, clients are naturally defensive and closed off. You will get hung up on, screamed at, and threatened. \r\n\r\nMost AE's close deals to fill their quota with little regard to how the campaign will perform. Churned business is an issue.\r\n\r\nBesides being expected to conduct a high volume of calls, you'll be tasked with a variety of chores that do little to help your bottom line- things like running reports to give your director information that he/ she can easily compile on their own. \r\n\r\nEverything listed in the CRM is either a bad opportunity, or someone who will hang up as soon as you tell them where you're calling from. We're told that there's a quality team that works to ensure all information in the CRM is accurate and organized- though oftentimes you will pick up an account that is a duplicate, or somehow otherwise taken. It makes getting through your day very difficult when the platform is unreliable. \r\n\r\nThe culture is dissatisfactory, at best. To start, the dress is meant to be business attire/ casual business- a rule that somehow doesn't apply to ladies in the Summertime. In addition, you cannot comfortably attend a company event without the pretense that there will be excessive drinking/ bad behavior. There's a collective frat-boy attitude towards every function in which you'll see your team mates drunk- Directors as well. Off the phone, clients are mocked, made fun of, and talked about- with plenty of expletives. There's no restraint here in what's supposed to be a professional setting. This can make it very difficult to network, and have pride in your work. \r\n\r\nIn addition to that, I haven't come across many people who enjoy themselves in this role. It's understood that the lifespan for someone in this role is 1-2.5 years (before burnout or failing to meet a quickly inflating quota.)

I personally feel like my work matters and I am not just a number.  I feel I am a valuable employee pushing this company forward and contributing to its growth.\r\n\r\nTeam - Our team in Austin is very collaborative and everyone is here to help one another.  It is not a cut throat environment by any means. Yes, we have big goals, but I feel like my manager is realistic when reviewing my performance. If I have a certain number of hires to reach and I do not, we take a look at what challenges I was facing that quarter, whether it be with difficult reqs, candidate pipeline, or tracking down feedback.  It is not just black and white, I feel like the quality of my work is valued just as much as the quantity.\r\n\r\nSystems - We recently moved to a new ATS which, as expected, caused a few hiccups.  There were massive amounts of candidate records and data that had to be transferred and scrubbed clean. The new ATS is quite different from what we were using before and it has taken some time for people to adjust.  The good news is that a lot of processes have been streamlined (i.e. offer approval, interview scheduling requests) which is a huge win for everyone.\r\n\r\nCareer progression - This has been a hot topic on everyone\u2019s mind. The way I see it - ask yourself how often are you expecting to be promoted or how long have you actually been with the company to deserve a promotion?  Most people are still relatively new to the organization (except for a few), yet everyone wants to know when they will be promoted. To this I say - prove yourself, get your tenure in, and the opportunities will come your way.  Work hard, do excellent work and you will be recognized.

More often than not they pick the less qualified person because hey at least we're buds. \r\n\r\n-The CS department has become a joke. The pay is laughable compared to other companies even though as a business they make a ton of $$$$$$. I've seen companies that make way less and pay better. They are treated like dirt compared to people in other departments. All they give you is silly stuff that doesn't matter.

This quickly wears off once you're sat at your assigned desk in the open office. The tech start up vibes are well and truly a thing of the past, and what's left is a phoney culture of \"helping people get jobs\", maximising profit by hook or by crook.\r\n\r\nWhich ever director you get sent to when you join the business will decide your fate. I can agree with the other reviewers here that if management don't like you, you are done. You will be bullied.\r\n\r\nThey all attempt to cloud the call centre atmosphere on the sales floor with fake banter, hitting the gong etc and then shove numbers down your throat. \r\n\r\nThere is also a tradition of pushing people out of the company by sheer bullying tactics and  It is DISGUSTING to see. \r\n\r\nAll Account Executives get given leads. These are employer accounts that have been created for free and who are posting jobs. Our job is to sell the premium package. Easy right?! You cannot prospect leads or search the CRM for accounts.\r\n\r\nOn the direct employer acquisition teams certain individuals will get better leads than others and some will receive nothing but fast food takeaways on Bournemouth beach. This is literally no joke. Sadly this is only one of the many issues with the lead generation. I'm sure it's company wide. Another seriously frustrating problem with the lead gen is that you will find that many of them you call are being worked by other AE's under different duplicated accounts  and confusion is stirred over who gets to keep what etc \r\n\r\nIf you make comments about the lead gen, you will be dealt with. The business deny that any favouritism goes on and insist that we are being randomly assigned them but everyone knows there is something more sinister at play.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day if your leads are bad then you will not do well or even hit target. This is how Indeed manage their staff if they want them out etc. The directors will also take spending accounts from individuals and give them to others if they think that the individual will not get more out of them. This may sound fair enough but when they cannot prospect their own leads and rely on incompetent lead generation, this leaves people short and hits them in the pockets.\r\n\r\nCowboys.\r\n\r\nThe product of PPC sponsored jobs/ featured employer that we are selling has to be one of the biggest scams I've ever seen online. It's all a completely overpriced gamble. If you want to be absolutely rinsed as a client, then sign up. The free service works just as well if you repost the ads once a week/month and there is no way to flag users that do this. Frustrating because 90% the main users do this and we are powerless to stop it. No body wants to use the sponsored jobs and very few clients get a decent return on their investments. \r\n\r\nThere is no contract either so the clients that do spend money can stop at anytime. And they do eventually, they all do. \r\n\r\nTo combat this your director will demand that you have a back up plan, obviously. But  inevitably the churn wheel just goes around and around. It's unsustainable \r\n\r\nThe directors simply regurgitate orders from senior management (who haven't hit target all year) and make themselves look busy. They have no experience in management outside of Indeed.\r\nMany of them are narcissistic and arrogant and will micromanage your every move. \r\n\r\nMicromanagement is a big big problem here. It gets to the point where you will literally be looking over your shoulder. Expect to make 60 calls and 120 minutes of talk time as a minimum KPI. This is achievable but unnecessary. You will be shocked to see that again some individuals, regardless of circumstance, will be able to skimp on these and others will be reprimanded for not hitting them everyday. \r\n\r\nUnlimited holidays is another giant lie they tell you to brew excitement at interview stage. This is just not true. I have taken less holidays here than any other job I've had. Reason is that you simply do not have the time and the targets are a stretch to say the least. Your dictator will not approve holidays if you are slightly behind or if in their humble opinion have not given enough notice.\r\n\r\nSqueeze squeeze squeeze. \r\n\r\nI'm currently seeking other employment as I cannot bear to work here anymore.

Prospects (GOOD prospects) are far and few between so holding on to the few good leads you have is key. But even then, the chances of you closing a lead that has been called by at minimum 10 other reps before you is slim to none. This is because at Indeed, you must make at least 60 calls a day. If you don't have enough viable leads, you're calling the same leads more than once per day...over time, or maybe even immediately, you're going to find that people aren't picking up the phone simply because it's Indeed calling AGAIN.\r\n\r\nThe business rules only add fuel to the fire when it comes to the actual working environment. Recognition for work well done is a great thing in any organization, but it could be argued that Indeed puts too much emphasis on this. This leads to an ego-centric mindset amongst both reps and managers...there is a semblance of \"team\" structure but it's actually every man/woman for themselves. The vision of the company is lost every time someone rings the bell and gets to play their song. If you're not doing well it's only a reminder that you're either leaving soon or that you need a miracle...You only end up thinking about your specific position. I'm not saying that it's impossible to maintain the overall vision, I'm just saying that this becomes harder and harder to do and you may find that you're asking yourself if it's even worth it.  Petty-ego boosting and self-aggrandizement is a daily occurence, especially on the part of managers. This leads to excessive micromanagement that can build up to borderline harrassment and deception on the part of managers when a rep isn't doing so well. And it's all justified...because at the end of the day if sales aren't being made it is 100% the rep's fault.\r\n\r\nSo my advice to you, if you're in the interview process is to ask your recruiter very specific questions about the company culture and how long on average a rep will last in their role.

This has caused the current group of managers to be woefully unfamiliar with the skills needed for daily work and the culture of the company. This is a development team, and honestly, except for one or two people, I doubt anyone in management can actually code.\r\n\r\nWhich wouldn't be a problem if they were there to be guiding the strategic vision of the team, but they spend most of their time plotting against each other rather than actually articulating the direction.

There's so much talk internally about pay bands but don't expect any transparency about what they are. That's because they're completely arbitrary and don't make any sense. This lack of clarity is a recipe for disaster regarding pay discrimination and I hope they get called out on this sometime.

Here is the unfortunate answer: Indeed calls you a 'technical business analyst' so they don't have to pay you a 'software engineer' or 'data scientist' salary, and often does not consider you to be the same level as one. \r\n\r\n3. Stemming from the previous point - because the hiring bar is lower for this role than SWE/Data Science, the quality of engineering is often times lower than that of a SWE/Data Scientist. Therefore, important impactful projects that have significant effect on the website, that people really care about, are not given to Technical Business Analysts, and rather, the projects you would take on are 99% of the time building internal tools, internal dashboards, etc. if you are lucky.

This is psychologically devastating, as all sales numbers are public, and the party line as espoused by the Directors is that failure is due to a lack of drive.

A lack of understanding from management only exacerbates the feeling of hopelessness.\r\n\r\n- A lack of lead generation/marketing. A huge problem with this is the \"Small Business\" sector of Indeed holding on to leads that should be passed to the Sales team for follow up. Meanwhile, sales professionals at Indeed comb the homegrown CRM for leads held by other reps that can be taken according to business rules. This causes many sales people at Indeed to fight with one another, and new team members are often ostracized until after they've built a book. The easiest way to get prospects is to wait for others to quit or get fired, as management will pass these leads out to others on the sales team after a rep departs.\r\n\r\n - A lack of direction. Internal policy disputes among managers often sets different areas of the company (Sales, Client Services, Small Business, Finance) at loggerheads. This creates an atmosphere similar to a schoolyard. The upper management should get all parts of the business on the same page.\r\n\r\n- Low pay (specific to California). A large part of the reason that Indeed is foundering in the San Mateo office is the low salaries offered to new employees, and the insulting raises given to those who have actually stuck it out. This attracts a lot of new college grads, which in the end leads to high turnover."}, {"review_title": "BEST PLACE EVER", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Recruiter in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everything.
