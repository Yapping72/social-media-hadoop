I liked working there; I liked the people, but I was looking around anyhow, so it worked out well for me. The reason I was looking around is I do not see how it is possible for the company to survive without changing their business a lot. The change will require massive layoff. They have had them on a regular basis, but I suspect (I have no knowledge of this) that they will increase.\r\nWhat I am saying is nothing you can't read in the trade publications. Storage companies like NetApp face competition from the cloud. Even if they do well selling to cloud providers, there will be fewer data centers than if every company had their own and, thus, less need for NetApp's products. \r\n\r\nAnother is that they made an enormous commitment to clustered Data ONTAP, and I think the technology is outdated. I have many friends in Silicon Valley outside the company that work in businesses that have massive amounts of data, and many of them are shifting to commodity solutions (or started out that way). For instance, Facebook has used (and helped invent) Gluster, hdfs is used under Hadoop, which now being used by banks and other enterprise customers that are the kind of customer that NetApp serves.   These commodity solutions stripe data across a large number of inexpensive Linux systems and use block level replication for performance and data protection. Though this requires more physical discs because the storage is not as compact as RAID, especially with deduplication, reconstructing failed discs is much faster, and it provides performance benefits.  You can buy Linux systems for $9. \r\n\r\nTheir hybrid flash solutions are excellent, well designed and reliable (like everything they do) but, you can buy hybrid drives at Best Buy. It is not the same thing but, they are high-performance and when used in conjunction with the kind of filesystems I mention above can give blazing performance. They could go into this market because better administration tools are needed, the deduplication problem has not been solved and much is needed but, it is a commodity market, which is much different than their current business. \r\n\r\nThey are also competing in the flash market. They have no choice here but to be competitive on price. I can't imagine how they could maintain their margins if they have to do that so, again, they would have to go into a commodity business. \r\n\r\nI want to reiterate that I have absolutely no idea of what they plan to do and I am just telling you the logic that had me looking elsewhere.  The way it looked to me is that their high-end market was going to get eaten away by lower priced commodity solutions.  It happened to IBM, it happened to DEC, it happened to Sun -- IBM was big enough to survive but the other two are gone.  HP successfully switched to a commodity business but not without carnage in the workforce. \r\n\r\nFinally, it is looking more and more like memristors are going to work. They are being manufactured. They can be manufactured in current fab facilities with some modification. Flash memory requires specially build fabs. Also, flash has a short lifespan. You can only write to it a small number of times, and it stops working where the writes have happened. For that reason, the software that manages the flash has to be relatively complicated.  It needs to keep track of where writes have happened and choose the parts of the memory that have been written to the least. \r\n\r\nMemristors are so fast that they can be used both as long-term storage and as system memory. That means there won't be any external memory. Since they can be manufactured in ordinary fabs, the price should become quite cheap. They use 1/100th the amount of power, and a terabyte can fit in an area the size of a postage stamp, a petabyte in the volume of a sugar cube. That means even if the initial price is higher the cost of owning them is much lower. Besides all that, they can do millions of writes where flash can do thousands. \r\n\r\nIt will be several years until memristors are ready for prime time, but they are being manufactured now. \r\n\r\nNetApp has a long history of being adaptable, and I would not be surprised at all if they made the changes necessary to survive in the changing environment. Unfortunately, I can't see how that could happen without a massive reduction in force. I started learning the new technology in preparation for moving on, and I did not even have to apply for a job.  I took some time off to do some projects I had been putting off and after I decided to get serious about finding a new job I had one in days.\r\n\r\nThink about it. NetApp is laying people off and, logically, they will have to lay off more. The new industries that are replacing them are gobbling up people as fast as they can. \r\n\r\nYou can learn there, it is a great place to work, the people are nice and it might be worthwhile. The tech industry is always changing but, be prepared for this to be a place that will be shrinking, not growing.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, that gets depressing."}, {"review_title": "Turned into \"Cisco Lite\"", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Member of Technical Staff II in Sunnyvale, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice work-life balance. \r\nAtmosphere that is simultaneously laid-back yet stimulating and hard-working.\r\nFriendly, intelligent, and approachable senior engineers  - a rare trifecta!\r\nCulture that used to be amazing, now still OK but a shadow of its former self.\r\nCorporate sponsored beer-bashes.\r\nSolid perks/benefits, especially 401k match and onsite training courses.", "cons": "Company has slowly been going downhill; Salary hasn't kept up with industry standard, layoffs have been an annual occurrence, and growth opportunities are becoming even more limited within the company.\r\n\r\nInstability - both in upper management and in the company's products themselves - has become a serious issue.\r\n\r\nBoth these have combined to dramatically lessen employee morale."}], [{"review_title": "New College Graduate Experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Member of Technical Staff QA in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay, good stock options, nice perks.

Here are my observations:\r\n\r\n- The biggest problem at NetApp is the business unit structure. While this model may work really well in other organizations, I consider this a colossal mistake in NetApp's case. The BUs act like little fiefdoms, who not only don't work together at all but actively criticize the others on a constant basis.\r\n\r\n- NetApp has become increasingly political in my time here. There's an extreme attitude of \"don't play in my sandbox\", often at the cost of collaboration. The blame game is huge in every team I've worked for or with. This political atmosphere also creates a death-by-committee when it comes to decision-making. To get approval for even mundane things, you often have to get approval/input from 5-10 people, because they all want to be the decision-maker on everything.\r\n\r\n- There is very little opportunity for growth here. Basically, moving your career path means moving into a lateral position, until there is another layoff. Layoffs happen often, and upper management never acknowledges them or explains them, so instead, one day you'll just notice a whole bunch of colleagues are gone.\r\n\r\n- NetApp is stuck in its way of thinking, and from my perspective, out of touch with the market. It immediately dismisses competitors like Pure and Nutanix instead of learning from their successes. There's a reason potential customers love their simplicity...being outrageously complicated isn't a good thing for a tech company. And this \"stuck\" way of thinking might also be due to the makeup of employees. At least at headquarters, the average age of an employee has to be 50. There are maybe 20 people under 30 on the entire campus, and every year the intern program seems to get smaller. If you don't hire a better percentage of young talent, you're never going to evolve with the market and keep your perspective fresh."}, {"review_title": "Incompetent technical team and very insecure (leads to horrible politics)", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Aug 2010", "job_title": "MTS4 in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1. flexible timings\r\n2. average salary", "cons": "1.

Suggesting a good, scalable solution instead of a \"quick hack\" will get shot down because of time considerations... the fact that the good solution will save many man-months of work in the long run is ignored, because the guy making the decisions only has monetary incentive to get this release done ASAP; there is no incentive to actually do a good job.\r\n\r\nThe company doesn't care about their employees.

But its more like Wile E Coyote using black paint for the tunnel, and you quickly realize your the train about to run them over.  Lots of old decision making processes, that don't make sense regarding customers, products, tools, and teams.  And there always seems to be restructuring going on somewhere.\r\n\r\nSo a big grind from all the people I talk to is vacation, when you first start there you get 2 weeks just like everyone else.  But they force vacation as a shutdown at Christmas for 3-4 days, and starting in 2012 at 4th of july for 3 more days.  So your losing 6-7 days or you go without pay during the shutdowns.  \r\n\r\nTime management is critical at this company, because it is overwhelmed with busy work of emails and meetings.  The amount of email is at least double of any other company I ever been at.  And finding information is always a challenge, due to the shear number of \"portals\" the company has.  They are trying to consolidate but at a snails pace.\r\n\r\nSomething in regard to annual reviews that all members of my team never understood was the rating system.  Ratings from 1(best) to 5(worst), but by HR definition only 10% are allowed to be issued a 1. It is then that something like %20 can be 2, then 50-60% are 3's.  4 and 5 are reserved for people not doing their job.  So if there are only 5 people in your dept, then only 0.5% can be a 1.  And your rating of course determines your \"merit\" increase, as there are no cost of living adjustments I have seen.  So they claim a life / work balance, but not if you expect a 1 or 2.  If you just go to and from the office in typical fashion you will get a 3.\r\n\r\nI have never been at an IT manufacturer before, where the internal IT really was behind the times.  Your local in office people are good, but decisions come from HQ and India. There are constant upgrades happening and such, but the shear number of outages to critical databases is sometimes staggering.  The help desk is definitely run out of india, and they will close tickets as resolved when their clearly not.  But instead of re-opening a ticket, they create a new one.  So somehow the metrics are tied to number of tickets resolved.  And you will end up opening lots of tickets due to all the portals you will need access to.  But everything is designed with Windows in mind, so if you happen to have a MAC, which they claim to support, you might be out of luck getting help."}, {"review_title": "Horrible place to work for", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Oct 2012", "job_title": "Unfortunae Engineer Worked In Eyewash R&D Group of NetApp Bangalore in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Easy to decide whether to join R&D group of netapp bangalore or not\r\nDon't ever think to join NetApp Bangalore's R&D group, you will be incompetent very soon and you logical ability will go in vain and will be completely lost among bunch of illogical management and senior people in this group.\r\nWorst place in this world to work for any reasonable good person\r\nI wish there is -ve infinite rating to rate, I would have given -ve infinite", "cons": "Complete eyewash in the name in R&D\r\nlooting of hard earn NetApp money \r\nDictatorship, angry and retaliating nature of management\r\nPolitical and non-sense senior people who will make your life hell if you work with them\r\nManagement is completely dull and sick and makes other people sick as well\r\nNo value of being technically good\r\nYou are valuable only if you are politically aligned with management"}, {"review_title": "Great work/life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Technical Support Engineer III in Research Triangle Park, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It can be difficult to make a decent wage in IT and not work 60+ hours a week.

Too many managers that don't actually manage their employees, but simply serve as escalation managers when customers call in to complain about long running cases. TSEs are always backlogged with cases and many of them will sandbag to slow the deluge. The backlog leaves little room to self-improve during business hours and instead have to work extra hours to stay ahead. Promotions are hard to come by and seem politically motivated at times - sometimes to simply keep people after they threaten to leave. I can't speak for job satisfaction as a manager, as I never worked in that role.\r\n\r\nIn my current role, it's night and day. The stress level is very low and the amount of work is manageable rather than  overwhelming. However, this role has different challenges, such as lack of a clear definition of the job, which leaves it open to interpretation when reviews come around.

In reality, they really don't care what goes on in the trenches, how people really feel, and the actual issues that can make work here really difficult sometimes. \r\n\r\n2) Management actually believes their own stuff they are dishing out to people about it being a good company with a good culture and good work environment; in reality, they are completely detached from what goes on in the trenches and haven't got the faintest idea of the real issues that the minions are facing daily. \r\n\r\nI haven't decided yet which one is the case...\r\n\r\nSpecific issues: \r\n\r\nThere is an ever-growing rift between the minions in the trenches, middle-management, and top-level management. The vast majority of the minions are good people who just want to do their job well. Middle-management is mostly concerned about justifying their existence, playing the corporate game, and buying into and promoting the whole micromanagement/managing-by-numbers style, whether it actually makes sense or not. Top-level management, well, see above. \r\n\r\nThe larger the company grows, the slower it gets. Creativity and productivity is getting choked by processes, micromanagement, and management by numbers. What used to be an easy task and could be done quickly with some lateral informal communication now has to be done by the book/up the chain. Yes, processes have their place and purpose, but not if they impede productivity and morale. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of: morale has taken a nose-dive over the last year or so, especially in my area. The constant call for doing more, faster, with less is wearing people out. Schedules keep getting tighter and more aggressive. Management only seems to care about numbers and schedules and bottom lines. Budgets are getting tighter and tighter, hiring freezes, off-shoring work to India for cost savings, annual layoffs - you get the picture. Apart from the occasional beer bash or rah-rah speech or email, very little is done to help improve morale, motivate people in a positive manner, or curb the alarming, ever increasing attrition rate. \r\n\r\nIt's really a shame.

I spend close to 50% of my time working on a stupid spread sheet for bug forecasting; a week by week forecast of up to 16 weeks or more of how many bugs you will have each week. They call this an art of \"voodoo\" themselves. Yet the senior management will come down on you so fast and merciless if you exhibited any signs of unwillingness in doing it. \"We have been doing this for years and years\" is what they will say to you and that itself is enough reason to justify why they are doing it still so it seems.\r\nIf you went above your forecast, they want you to figure out why and where these bugs came from. If you went below your forecast, they want you to know if you padded your numbers and perhaps you should re-work your numbers re-forecast so you are not constantly below.\r\n\r\nThey seem to think making you spending all your time on bug forecast will help with their product quality, of which there are certainly many escalations exist including bringing down Apple's iTunes down frequently.\r\n\r\nIt seems all the good people who can think independently and cares about what they do have left the company and the ones who can not, got promoted to be manager/senior managers. Of cause there are exceptions. \r\n\r\nBonus and merits are good means for managers to retain talents. Here it is abused to play favoritism.    I have seen my manager withholding both to drive away a key talent in the team on a mission critical project. When I tried to put in a significant merit increase in a desperate try to keep the employee around, I was told I should never have done that without discussing this first and given that it is my first time, he'll forgive me for doing it. I, as the direct manager, seems to have no right to even make recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe senior manager of the team absolutely does not care how critical you are to the project at hand and/or NetApp, we had 9 people resign from his team in the past 2 years of a team sized ~20, a ~40% turn over rate which is so alarmingly high that it will certainly raise eye brows anywhere else in the industry. But it has not here. \r\n\r\nThere seem to be no accountability. As the product the senior manager delivered last caused numerous field escalations including the problems stated at Apple. The issues was not narrowed down/sort of patched up till ~20 engineers-year later. This has starved all other developments in the team. Because he knows no strategy except a \"pile-up\" one which he is quite proud of.\r\n\r\nHe is still there, driving away talents and delivering products with questionable quality, and god forbidden, might be on his way to be the next director.
