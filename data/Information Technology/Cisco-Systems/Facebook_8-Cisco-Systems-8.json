Coming out of college I was looking for an employer that would not only be financially rewarding in the short term, but also a company that would add value to me as a person and a worker. As such I was extremely pleased to be accepted into the Cisco Sales Associate Program, a year long training program that provides technical training, teaches sales skills and business acumen. The training was excellent and I feel well prepared now that I'm in a full time sales role. The pay's great, the opportunity for Cisco and it's employees is incredible, and I'm looking forward to a bright future ahead of me with Cisco. Most compelling however is the quality of people I work with. I've been thoroughly impressed with the diversity of experience and strong wills within the sales organization. All in all Cisco's a great place to start a career and I couldn't be happier.", "cons": "Needless to say the great rewards are a result of great demands. This means often working long hours, particularly as a new salesman. However, I wouldn't rate it as excessive or unreasonable given the position. In addition to demands on time, they demand results. This means occasionally employees are let go for underperforming, and some people are uncomfortable with such quantitative metrics. Moreover, if you're not too interested in technology and what it can do for businesses, schools, governments, and individual's lives, then obviously Cisco's not the place to be. I would imagine as well that when Cisco was primarily a route/switch vendor it was harder to get excited about the technology, but now everyone from Jack Bauer to Michael Scott's using our stuff."}, {"review_title": "too much politics", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Jun 2008", "job_title": " in Santa Clara, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Employees are permitted to work from home at least once a week.

Engineering staff there had serious morale issues. My peers were constantly \"joking\" about how terrible the product we were all working on was. At first I wondered why nobody did anything to just fix the issues. After working there a while I realized it was because the engineers have practically zero ability to effect change in the product. So the senior engineers there are basically just going through the motions because the pay is pretty good, the benefits are basically second to none, and they don't want to lose that. Meanwhile the younger engineers are leaving because the environment is pretty awful. \n\nHaving your own hard-wall office seems great at first until you realize you hardly ever collaborate with the people on your team. On my project the standard practice was to assign a single engineer to develop a feature, write tests, and perform QA in practical isolation. As you can imagine this was pretty stressful and didn't work very well, resulting in buggy products due to lack of a dedicated QA team. Asking for help on an engineering issue was usually like pulling teeth because you had to pull other engineers away from their work to collaborate. Management was not receptive of suggestions to change the status quo to alleviate these issues. My manager frequently missed our weekly one-on-one meetings, sometimes for several weeks in a row.

The ideal situation in Cisco is to join a group which already has good mix of engineers at every level, and a strong upwardly mobile manager who trusts you and manages upwards well. If you can find this opportunity, and perform well, you will have the best career prospects. \r\nThat said, the best thing about working for Cisco might just be that you if you are a competent and productive engineer, you have quite a bit of flexibility in defining your role and your contribution level. If you are really gunning for promotions, look for a good group, find a niche, take on roles that are difficult or un-wanted, and work your rear end off. If you want to coast and balance your time between work and other interests, then find a steady group, manage your time well, and you can stay safe in your job with just about 40 hours of work a week... and you might have the flexibility to telecommute or work from home.\r\nAnother note - Cisco is a great place for competent women. There is a strong network of women employees and a tradition of mentorship, that really helps career growth.", "cons": "The down-side of working at Cisco is that the salary is not great. And promotions & bonuses can get very competitive at the senior level. So, if end up in a group that is over-loaded with good people at your level and above, then you can get stuck in a situation where you are working hard but not getting enough rewards, bonus, or visibility.\r\nActually, getting stuck in the wrong group can be a pretty bad experience over the long term. Talk to people and do your research before you accept any offer. \r\nYour manager is also very important. There are two types of managers you want to avoid. One (relatively rare) will use you to get ahead but not give you a fair share of recognition. The other (more common) one is a  manager who is so swamped and has such little management insight / experience, that he or she is not able to help you with adequate guidance, especially when it comes to career development and growth. \r\nThere is one other danger I must mention. This applies even in 'good' groups. There is a tendency at Cisco to just keep loading you with more and more responsibilities until you actually stand up and say enough. If this is an interesting job, you might find that you are spending more time on work than you had originally planned, at the expense of family, friends, etc. So decide for yourself how much you want to work and what your goals are. And then be prepared to work with your management to define the appropriate role. \r\nNo one will come and ask you what you want at Cisco. You have to decide that for yourself, and then communicate it to your management.\r\nAlso, if you do end up in a bad situation, be prepared to make an honest assessment of the situation and leave. No one likes to quit, but if you end up staying 5 or 6 years without fair rewards, you will find yourself falling well behind people who were your peers when you started... and this is really not a good experience."}, {"review_title": "I recommend working here but you must be an extreme self starter/motivator.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Jun 2008", "job_title": "Senior Technical Writer in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benys and flex schedule are obvious pluses.

Everyone takes pride in the company's innovation, but I think we're mostly riding on past reputation, and improving products we already have.  While we've done a great job promoting TelePresence, its not exactly a new idea - we just improved on it.\r\nPart of the problem with the politics is that its difficult to move up once you get to say Sr. Manager/Manager level.

It will soon be my third year here, and all of my developer peers have also complained about slow growth within the company.\r\n\r\n- Due to the bureaucratic nature of the company, communication among the many groups is slow and sporadic.\r\n\r\n- It may be different for other groups, but there seems to be a general lack of expertise when it comes to software development best practices:\r\n-- Everything is hacked together\r\n-- Quantity of features and speed of development > quality and stability\r\n-- There are no design/architecture discussions that include all of the developers (\"design\" of the product usually happens as informal conversations between mid-to-senior level developers, without including the newer/entry-level developers). These discussions are ad-hoc, informal, and often not even documented.\r\n-- No standards followed for releases/deployment\r\n-- Very little effort spent on documentation of anything\r\n-- We are one of the many groups that tries to follow Agile/Scrum, but since we don't follow a lot technical practices that actual make Agile work (e.g. unit tests, code reviews, decent documentation, reasonably-sized & well-defined user stories, etc.), it isn't working as it should. The end result is shoddy code and constantly accumulating technical debt.\r\n\r\n- People in non-technical roles (middle managers and product owners) push for features and user stories without really knowing what they want. User stories are often a terse title and an empty description (no behavioral/functional specifications, no summary, no consideration for inter-dependencies among other user stories).\r\n\r\n- Projects often lack clear direction. This point applies to my group and our project, but I think it might apply to other groups as well. There are many technical leaders in our group, but for our project, we lack a TRUE lead technical architect who:\r\n\r\n1) has a clear vision of what the product should be like\r\n2) plans architecture & development tasks for the group\r\n3) mentors less experienced developers\r\n4) maintains standards on code quality and development processes\r\n\r\nBottom line: If you're looking for a place to hone your technical skills and grow as a developer, look elsewhere. Some of the other reviewers who mentioned a culture of complacency absolutely hit the nail on the head. I have observed first-hand many times where our group has accepted mediocre work or shortcuts without hesitation \"if it gets the job done,\" creating more technical debt. When developers ask for time to address technical debt, we are rebuffed by managers who claim that it is \"good enough\" and that we should focus on pumping out more features.

If you're unable to do this that will be considered as a weakness and will be taken as a good reason for not giving you opportunity to work on technologies that you already know of, interested in and in which you've already proved your skills.

I have never been as happy with my immediate manager in any job as I have been at Cisco (save the past year or two).\r\n\r\nCisco prides itself on hiring the right folks - as anyone subjected to the myriad of interviews can attest - and I have to say they generally hit home runs. 90%+ of the people I work with have been excellent, self-starting, and knew their stuff - or learned it on-the-job and jumped right in.", "cons": "I know that Stack Ranking gets a bum rap, but you know who really likes it?.. folks who rank well and bust their backsides to get there. With the move to \"The People Deal\" (still have no idea WTF that means), Stack Ranking went away - as did the RSUs. I get nearly 1/3 of my total compensation from RSUs, so these are the \"golden handcuffs\" that keep me here. No more RSUs, no more cuffs, perhaps time to look elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhy leave? I have been on the cutting edge of new markets for Cisco for be better part of the last decade. These are places where they make big bets, but quickly grow into a bureaucratic model that sells its soul to the first customer to sign a PO, then slowly drown and sink as that customer (or customers) weigh us down and not pivot with the rest of the market.\r\n\r\nAs I look around the landscape and view Cisco's attempts to pivot to Cloud and recurring revenue models, it is very clear that they are not learning from these failures. They burn out or run off all of the folks who could help prevent the next failure, thus do not learn the lesson. Or, in other cases, they do not allow enough time to get things rolling. You basically have 3 years to be #1/2 in the market - or else. \r\n\r\nReference the recent death of Intercloud as an example of what I mean. They committed $1 billion to the project, but had a massively flawed business model from the start. After all, who can compete with AWS when it comes to plain IaaS? They were far too late to bring the other table stakes bits that go along with that (VPNaaS, LBaaS, FWaaS, Big Data as a Service, etc). Many of those were just about to launch when they canned the entire engineering portion of the project. One of the major distractions - and reasons for the delay in getting that stuff in place - was being saddled with their two external partners. These partners contracted one thing, then asked for a wildly different deployment model or Roles and Responsibilities. These held back any further evolution and improvement of the platform. \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong: We screwed up alot, too, but those early commitments killed our velocity and ability to pivot."}], [{"review_title": "rudderless & hopeless -- a colossal waste of motivated talent", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "1 Feb 2017", "job_title": "Senior Engineering Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* Excellent technical talent\r\n* Many excellent leaders\r\n* Executive leadership cares about the quality of leadership & management (and appreciates the difference)\r\n* Deep security awareness\r\n* Ambitious people who want to make a difference\r\n* Strong compensation possible for the lucky", "cons": "* If you think of VSEM (vision, strategy, execution & measurement), the executive leadership seems to be focused on financial execution to the exclusion of all other concerns.

Young talent, or the lack thereof it.  Cisco is trying to aggressively hire young people, out of college, and that process is highly competitive, and painful for the new hires.  Cisco WAS a young company ten years ago, now it's just middle aged or looking towards retirement.  No one is retiring yet though, so for the next 10 years, young talent has no where to go without the older folks moving out first.\r\n2.  Hiring from outside for management positions.  Cisco used to have the top 10% of the workforce, so they said, and wouldn't hire directly from competitors to hurt them.  That's a lie we've been living with for some time now at Cisco.  Managers are routinely picked off from companies such as Nortel, Avaya, Checkpoint, Juniper, and now Microsoft.  Our \"culture\" at Cisco is turning into the culture of our biggest competitors from middle management down.  How is this good?\r\n3.  Lack of proper compensation. \"you're a salaried employee, now work overtime all the time\" mindset.  I've had it happen to me, and seen many others put in their fair share, and then work 18 hours days on top of that for months with little or no recognition.  $500 bucks doesn't cut it in terms of recognition, it's more like a spit in the face and backhanded compliment.\r\n4.  Work life balance... there is none.  There are a lot of folks at Cisco who just can't unplug, for fear that they'll get behind.  We all know the world will stop spinning if you go home at 5pm, and don't immediately log in to see what you missed in the commute home.  The culture pushes a work life balance, but when other coworkers come to you and complain about you taking a Friday off, or going on summer vacation...what the heck?  Management claims this is okay as well, but I've been called on weekends, holidays, and vacations for issues others can handle in my absence.  Letting the call roll to voicemail on your cisco provided phone doesn't cut it either.  \r\n5.  Equity Adjustment is just another way to say we don't value your time or money enough to actually pay you at the rate of inflation, so here's another $1k a year to help you with those rising fuel costs.

Some of this may be due to chronic understaffing, but with the build-up of teams in India, the understaffing is less of a problem.  We try to be very responsive to customers, but as the pool of customers in our case consists of a small number of large customers, being customer-driven can lead to sudden changes in priorities and feature creep into products and development cycles.  It's been suggested that rather than be so customer-focused and driven, we should lead the way in product development and innovation so that customers will want the products we develop, but we don't seem to be able to do that.  It has also been the case that management will try to promote good practices by training everyone in some new method (of time management or work planning), but after the initial push, the effort is abandoned and management support for the new methods seems to vanish.  We are schedule-driven no matter how unrealistic the schedule, and it's only when the true scope of the work becomes impossible to ignore that schedules (with management, with the customer) get renegotiated and start to resemble reality.

I know a lot of this is typical of big companies. But Cisco isnt any different. The problem i see here is the typical old saying \"Too many cooks, spoil the broth\". Cisco sometimes has too many people in one big team, rather than splitting up the work among different teams. This causes several issues, one is that everybody is here to succeed, to be promoted and there is too much competition (healthy competition is good, but when your peers cross the work-life balance, its difficult to meet the same expectations, its unhealthy competition) (Yeah i know, its all about hard work is the path to success, but a work-life balance is very necessary, trust me). \r\n\r\nMy team has poor management of resources and the upper management never gives a clear message.

I recall Chambers referring to this culture with a statement that went something along the lines of \"Cisco is the largest startup around\". There certainly were drawbacks to such an approach - mostly around the costs - but on balance this system worked. Cisco was a great and dynamic place to work, filled with folks who were enthusiastic about their work, excited about the future, and ready to sacrifice for a place they felt cared about their welfare. This is no longer the case. Cisco has morphed over the years into a large corporate hierarchy filled with the same political intrigues and maneuvering that plague other companies of this size. Gone is the sense that the employee matters; gone is the willingness to sacrifice; gone is the sense that the company as a whole is united.\r\n\r\nBut this doesn't necessarily make Cisco a bad place to work - it's just not particularly exciting or different from other large corporate behemoth's. Nowadays, people don't come to Cisco to find groups bubbling with excitement, they come to Cisco for the stability of a large, entrenched, and healthy company with a solid compensation system.

As a senior manager I get a bit more exposure to the behind the scenes than many of the other posters.  Some of the positives:\r\n\r\n- Ability to balance work/life - From my experience the lack of work/life balance is largely self inflicted when it occurs.  It's also far from universal.  I have had zero problem ever with taking time off.  Making my weekends my own and shutting down after I go home.  Based off of the empty parking lots in Boxborough and San Jose after 6:00 at night there are many others who have the same experience.\r\n\r\n- Ability to communicate upward honestly - I'm not only encouraged but absolutely required to communicate up to my director the real state of things.  He doesn't want things sugar coated he wants to know the real state of things.  When there are problems he trusts me to handle them and to escalate when I need help. Then he provides it.\r\n\r\n- Attempt at a fair rating rankings process -  Every attempt is made to assure that the twice a year ratings/rankings process is done fairly.  In my organization every manager is required to be able to justify in detail their stack ranking of employees.  We then go through a laborious process to merge the stack rankings across the managers.  While from an outside perspective it can seem like people aren't being rewarded from an internal perspective the reality is we have a highly talented and competitive workforce.  Most of the employees fit into the \"Core\" grouping.  The core grouping are people that are very good at their jobs but not \"excelling\".\r\n\r\n- Renewed investment in College Hires.  Cisco has a major initiative going on for the past 2 years to hire both interns and full-time candidates.  This includes a fantastic sponsorship program for H1 students which employees them outside of the US if they don't make it through the lottery.  They are employed outside the US until they can be eligible for an H3 or other means of coming back into the US.  That's as good as any company can offer.", "cons": "That being said Cisco isn't perfect.  Far from it.\r\nRatings Rankings -  It's simple math.  If you stack rank your employees you can always identify a top 10% and a bottom 5%.  That doesn't mean that the bottom 5% are employees you want to get rid of or who are not good at their jobs.  \r\n\r\nMore than a few people focused on their careers to the exclusion of all else - Of course not only a Cisco problem but with the driven type A people we hire there are many that will stop at nothing to advance careers. \r\n\r\nRatings Rankings at odds with teamwork - When you know you are going to be ranked against every member of your team you are not incented to make your teammate look good at your expense even if it's the right thing for the company."}, {"review_title": "Good place to work.

CIsco's so-called \"collaborative\" environment  focuses primarily on CYA tactics dominated by political motivations to manipulate image. In these meetings you'll see discussions center around how to make project \"look good\" and how to hide issues that \"look bad\". No discussion or activity on doing the right thing for customer and for quality of product(s).\r\n- *Cheapest solution is synonymous with best solution* With such low skilled engineering and management talent in place there is no understanding of common processes such as trade-off analysis between quality of work, time and cost. You are expected to produce the quickest, cheapest solution under all circumstances as long as it looks good on a slide when presented to execs. This is culturally pervasive throughout the organization.\r\n- *Impossible to exert influence* Staff and management are so unsophisticated about the industry and market realities that they don't even know what they don't know. There is no possible way to influence in this type of environment. Your years of finely honed technical skills and field experience carry no weight among the myriad of sales and marketing execs who can't think beyond the current quarter. Short-term sales goals trump every argument under all circumstances.\r\n- *Poor quality work is rewarded* The formula for success is say \"yes\", do poor work, hide tracks, wait for next re-org, get promoted. There is no follow up on effectiveness or quality of work - ever. You are simply measured on how quickly you get a task done and how well you \"make yourself look and your boss look\" for quarterly ops reviews. If it looks good on a single power point slide, then it is good - reality is nothing.\r\n- *Factory worker mentality* Management overly obsessed with the adage \"if you can't measure it, you can't manage it\". With marketing and sales dominating executive ranks, the metrics used to measure performance are nothing short of comical. Not only are such metrics easy to manipulate through unproductive activity but often encourage adversarial internal relationships (for example, tester performance evaluated positive on bugs found per week and developer performance evaluated negative on same metric). This makes managements job easy when it comes time to rank and lay off employees but severely hurts product quality, employee moral and the corporate bottom line.\r\n- *Unrealistic expectations* Other than sales opportunities, execs are years behind in product deployment strategy and customers quality requirements. Execs haven't a clue what it takes to roll-out production ready products and continually ignore people who know and can prove otherwise. As a result, engineers are expected to make up difference in totally absurd time frames and that can only be achieved  by producing poor quality work. And if you don't meet expectations, you will hear about it next review."}], [{"review_title": "Challenging work, Bad work culture", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Mar 2011", "job_title": "Software Engineer in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "networking leader, cutting edge technology, some BU s are good for a 9-5 job. others are sweatshop\r\ngood for people who like flexibility like wfh, generous PTOs and facilities", "cons": "too much bureacracy and no work life balance\r\ntoo much politics\r\nnothing done for  employee morale\r\nvery bad career growth\r\nnot much compensation increase\r\ncost cutting in basic facilities like break room supplies\r\nbad cafe"}, {"review_title": "Good place to work, if you're into more than 50+ hours a week", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Mar 2011", "job_title": "Program Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Cisco is great with collaboration, although the right hand never knows what the left hand is doing in terms of BUs.", "cons": "Work hours are long and working multiple timezones is mostly a must.
