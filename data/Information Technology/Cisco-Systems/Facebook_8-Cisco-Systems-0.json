The primary reason being is that when you decide to leave an organization it is usually because there is something there that isn't aligning with you or what you want anymore however, the grass is not always greener someplace else.  This has been my experience.  In fact, the appreciation I have for the company has grown so much in my time away that I would really like to return.\r\n\r\nThe company truly believes on promoting within and as an employee you are encouraged to grow your career within the organization and learn new skills by taking different positions.  Benefits are excellent.  Cisco is the industry leader for networking and now cloud.  It is sometimes easy to forget that on the daily grind but you are working for the company that everyone looks to for network and infrastructure standards.  Culture within the business units managing product lines give you a lot of freedom to be innovative and creative in your approach to your role.  In most cases you are given a fair amount of autonomy and control over how you do your job provided that it aligns with the strategic objectives.  Benefits, 401k match, RSUs and ESPP are amazing.  And while the salaries aren't the top of the industry, they are above market and pretty competitive.", "cons": "Cisco can be a machine.  There isn't an overt demand for all of your time (even the time outside of work) but more of a subtle, slight encouragement to always be on.  If you are not careful, you will live, sleep and eat Cisco 24x7.  Don't get me wrong, this is 100% a choice and if you are aware of this subtlety in the culture it is very easy to set appropriate boundaries that will be respected by the company and leadership team.\r\n\r\nIf you don't like where you are in Cisco or what you are working on, give it 6 months because you will be reorg'd.  While it is sometimes necessary to realign the company to meet competitive threats or market demands, reorganizing the company once a year is excessive and tends to create a distrusting environment for the rank and file which makes being a leader in the organize challenging.  There is a loss of momentum and motivation that occurs a few months before and a few months after reorgs so this leaves the company being effective at delivery and execution only about 70% of the time.\r\n\r\nWhile Cisco attracts some bright, motivated people the truth of the matter is you are either cut out for the company and its culture or you're not.  If you aren't it will be painfully obvious to you and those around you.  Sadly as a leader it is hard to cut dead weight from the team and the only really accepted way is via layoffs, which is why the company reorgs once a year despite the company line about the reorgs."}, {"review_title": "2011 Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "25 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Account Manager in Research Triangle Park, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High-Quality Products: Cisco's products are known for their high quality, reliability, and performance.

Many great engineers have left due to the failures of our recently promoted leadership. ESG is such a high focus that our products are failing simple quality checks.

(However the Cisco reputation is not the same as it used to be) - The offices are pretty amazing with state of the art facilities. You do not get much time to use these facilities though. But they're there. We had a mini cinema hall in the Bangalore office. It doesn't get any better than that. - Work from home option, in some teams, is quite flexible. - A well connected pickup and dropoff cab service in the Bangalore office (Not free, but costs about Rs. 2000 per month)", "cons": "Where to begin - There is zero involvement from HR whatsoever. If your director/manager is exploiting you, which by the way is extremely common, you have no one to help you. Only your teammates, who are probably also being exploited. - You are completely at the mercy of your direct and second level bosses. If your team is toxic (my experience), you will suffer a lot. In the many years I have been in Cisco Bangalore, I have seen so many people in a similar situation as me. Helpless, with the only option to look outside Cisco for work. - There is no work-life balance whatsoever. If you have a geolocated team, you are expected to be available for work/meetings in all timezones. 'Night meetings' are ubiquitous and you are expected to work on weekends too. - Layoffs are so frequent that even before the upcoming layoff occurs, rumors of the next layoff are commonplace. Who is going to be laid off doesn't matter at all on the person's merit or capability, but on the relationship they have with their manager and director. - Promotion cycles get cancelled very frequently. Bonuses are more or less always meagre, with a company factor, usually below 100%, which means you get a lower bonus than your bonus target just because the overall company is always under performing. - The CEO is an ex-sales VP, who's only focussed on profits. Since Cisco is losing market share and yearly revenues are always less than $50bn, Chuck Robbins' method for maintaining profits and consequently dividends is to hire execs with the mission to lay off a huge chunk of their teams in the so called 'streamlining' initiatives. All you hear in Cisco is layoffs. - Cisco's policy of internally promoting managers based on years of service rather than capability has filled Cisco's ranks of managers with incompetant managers (and even directors) who are more suited for tech lead or project management positions. They lack vision and foresight, and are only focussed on the present. Something I feel resonates all the way to the top with Chuck Robbins and his team in many regards. - The pay, in comparison to comparable roles in comparable companies, is always low. There is huge attrition which leads to lots of instability. It's been a tremendous challenge planning projects since teams are always transient. - The hiring process for Cisco is to hire people cheap who will be able to 'do the job' rather than 'invent new products'. Getting hired by Cisco is no longer a big deal. Thus there is a huge upsurge of converting red badge employees, who are from vendor companies, to blue badge full Cisco employees. This ensures the business is run... but not changed. Cisco loses innovation and invention, and consequently its leading edge. This problem is spread across almost all teams. - There are so many layers between you and the customer, that you will probably never get the opportunity to talk to a customer directly. Which basically means you slowly lose knowledge of what the market wants. Thus when you apply outside for a new role, you know what your manager/director wants, but not what the customers want."}, {"review_title": "TME", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Marketing Engineer in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work-life balance is very great", "cons": "Salary is not competitive in the field"}, {"review_title": "goal", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Virtual Sales Specialist in Shanghai, Shanghai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "WLB, value on employee, breaks", "cons": "very large structure, process is slow"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Chennai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good people Work life balance", "cons": "Management can be improved Hybrid working"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "29 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Smart teams, state of the art workplace!", "cons": "Limited availability of tools,devices for development"}, {"review_title": "Amazing good company with some drawbacks", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Product Sales Specialist in Stockholm, Stockholm", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "strong leadership, taking care of all people awesome colleagues Strong \"machines\", hardly ever lose any deals to competition Superstrong portfolio The midrange of social security benefits", "cons": "Salary and benefits are totally out of time, they are still as they were 10 to 15 years ago, so our competition has easy to recruit people from us.

It's overall a great place to work. But if you haven't worked as an hourly employee for a while, here are some of the pros and cons. The main positive thing about it is overtime and double time. You know those happy hour parties that you, the admin, manages until the wee hours, sometimes including clean up and strike? You get paid 1.5x your regular hourly rate for more than 8 hours and less than 12 hours, and then if you go over 12 hours, you get paid 2x your hourly rate for that hour or more. As long as your tax withholdings are set up correctly, this can be a huge, huge benefit.", "cons": "I left in 2019; perhaps it has changed since then, and it may be different depending on which business unit you are in. But a huge con is having to log your hours. The tool they use is an Oracle nightmare that's literally fresh out of 2006. Just having to use it in and of itself could be a big headache. If you miss the deadline, they pay you for the full 80 hours of your pay period, you just have to back-file for any missing overtime. Again, this review is only about the pros-cons of getting paid on an hourly basis as an administrative assistant. The other cons to getting paid hourly in a job that is typically part of the salaried crew is that you might have to get permission to add hours, and you might sometimes do work in the unapproved time anyway just because you have a strong work ethic and don't want to have to handle the fall out if a ball is dropped, essentially not charging for 100% of your work product just because of your boss's budget pressures. When I started there I didn't feel like I had to worry too much about how many hours I was working; I was hired to cover executive support for multiple high-level C-level and VP execs which is a more-than-full-time type of job. But then when company structure, politics and budget changes meant that my boss had to ask me to only put in 40 hours a week, my whole outlook on my position at the company changed. It meant essentially that I'd have to deliver a smaller work product to all of my execs, which in my line of work basically doesn't exist without loss of reputation. And then I got recruited away to my next role, which solved the problem.

Over 50% pay difference in many cases between people in same roles with same skills. Pay seems to be more about experience than skills - something that resembles a government company (could be a good thing for many since there is job security). \r\nThe TAC teams are especially bleeding talent due to terrible pay that has not kept up with industry. Freshers make more money than skilled, experienced folks who tend to leave to competitors. This has resulted in terrible support experience for customers. Most TAC cases globally are handled by folks with less product experience from Bangalore since the senior folks leave for better pay. \r\nSome teams are better placed in terms of decision making, benefits, product trainings etc than others. This disparity is often seen in different ways eg. Bangalore folks end up doing back office work and dont lead engagements or interact directly with customer.\r\nConsulting roles which are NOT TAC are amazing for experienced folks looking for relaxation and retirement only and really atrophy the skills of freshers who want to grow and learn.\r\nDo not stay if you want a pay bump.
