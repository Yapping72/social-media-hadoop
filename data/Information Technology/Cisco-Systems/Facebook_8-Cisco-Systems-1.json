They were a high-end employer with a keen eye for keeping employees comfortable and motivated. But in the last decade my stints with them had become disappointing. The Executive Assistants in any given unit will make or break you depending on if you are sufficiently obedient -- expressing confidence and expertise puts you in the dog house. The upper-level management is over 80% Indians with 60% of workers on SOWs from India and China; and the CEO pushes the woke agenda to the point you're rotated out if you aren't on board. Managers turn a blind eye to the internal politics. There are a lot of good people here, like any company. But contractors are looked down on by the administrative staff; and there's so many limits on permissions that you can barely get your job done. \r\n\r\nAs an experienced EA with decades of proven expertise, I expected my stint w/the flag-ship team to end in being recommended for other opportunities. But instead, I quickly realized the existing EAs were not only uninterested in someone coming in with organizational skills and top-level support but they resented it. One even said to me, 'Well, you're gonna make me look bad.' This is the same person who admonished me for following the direction of a senior director and ultimately feigned some problem with me in order to take the heat off themselves. She already had numerous complaints against her but they were ignored.  I was glad to leave there when my contract ended.  \r\n\r\nWhile they once prided themselves on a great work environment, the office space now is uncomfortable, stiff, and not user-friendly.  They were closing down buildings at a massive rate, and revamping current buildings to reflect the sparse, lower-functioning, remote work style even before the pandemic. Most of the new techies quit within 2 years and go elsewhere, and probably an even higher percent if they are American. It's just too hard to compete with the foreign pool of lower-paid workers. They seem to have adopted a business model of harvesting top-tier graduates, squeezing them dry and forcing them out to bring in the next level of top-tier, entry pay-grade talent. \r\n\r\nInstead of being a respectable, responsible business model for the industry, they've become a machine where the goal is to make it look good on the drawing board but everything else suffers. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't go back, especially not for the below-standard pay they offer the administrative staff."}, {"review_title": "Good benefits, bad work culture (as far as I have seen)", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer II in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good office space, facilities, compensation and benefits.", "cons": "Joined with lot of expectations - but unimpressed with my teams' work culture.\r\n1.

During my tenure my entire office of \"Gray Lizards\", people with decades of experience, customer relationships and technical knowledge of the quirks of older systems and how to keep them going, was riffed and we got a 42 page memo showing that in addition to those of us over 50, they had also removed several people who were 30 and thus no ageism existed in their decisions. While hard to accept, I do appreciate that times are changing for Cisco and they need to change with them.\n\nMid-Level \"Faces\" of the company change annually - indicating that priorities and investments are changing as well. Does not bode well for longer term employment stability after 2-3 years, especially if you are a project manager.\n\nAs with any company, politics is rife the higher you go. But at Cisco, the impact of politics is felt at operational levels in terms of investments, timelines rewards, and constraints. Duplicity is very common around projects that once held great promise, but now have new people with new priorities in place."}, {"review_title": "HW Engineer", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "13 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Technical Lead in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "work environment, good people, flexible", "cons": "Compensation, innovation, new technology, stock"}, {"review_title": "Nice company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance sometimes good", "cons": "Depends on the griup sometimes are bad"}, {"review_title": "Amazing Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Devops Engineer in Raleigh, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance is advocated for.", "cons": "A large company so can get stuck as a cog"}], [{"review_title": "Great atmosphere", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "2 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Internal Auditor in Offenbach am Main", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work it\u2019s helped me develop my skills.", "cons": "Not much of flexibility as such"}, {"review_title": "Nice", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "12 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Manager in Indi, Karnataka", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good co. to work for", "cons": "Freq.

Don't fall for the HR or CEO saying it's a best place to work.\n- If you get into Cisco make sure you ask which team it is for and go on LinkedIn find people who are working and ask them for their review. There are many teams who have useless work and pathetic culture especially in India.\n- I worked at a team called identity services engine. So heads up it's not a good team to be in especially for any fresher. Do not make the same mistake as I did by joining this place. Same goes to some other teams as well.\n- If you are a new grad I request you to not join Cisco as there are no smart people left. Most of them have already left because of poor pay and bad culture.

Every team might have different objectives, approaches, and the way they do their business. However, my review is based on my current team - Global Virtual Engineering (GVE).\n\nDue to the size of the companies, there can be quite a few changes happening every quarter and that is why I already had three different managers situated in three different countries. However, every single one of them shared the same principle - trust. \n\nThey trust you to use your instinct to manage your workload as well as choose the projects to work on. They then also provide you with all the support that you need - no micro-management! As long as you get the job done at the end of the quarter, then no one feels like they need to monitor your every step and make sure that you actually sit in front of your screen from 9-6 pm.\n\nYou are given complete freedom to manage your workload and focus on projects that are relevant to your experience as well as any other areas of interest.\n\nThe benefits are truly world-class too - everything ranging from the pension plan, life insurance, health insurance, and dental insurance is brilliant. I am not talking about the bare minimum where 99% of cases are not covered anyway.\n\nThe compensation is also great compared to what I have seen in the industry. The bonus plans are clearly defined and you know exactly what is expected of you to reach the goal - no gray areas.\n\nI also feel like if something urgent happens and you cannot work for some reason, the company will support you. No need to book a full day of PTO one month in advance for a 1 hour GP/Dentist visit, either.\n\nThe training and development opportunities are also countless. I am not necessarily talking about Cisco certifications. The company understands that in order to be successful, we also need to learn about other products or platforms, and they provide all the support we need.\n\nWhile the objectives I need to hit in order to progress in my career are not as clearly defined, I can see that good efforts are always appreciated in a fair way throughout the fiscal year.\n\nThere are numerous ways to get engaged with different teams or with your managers and directors. They are generally accessible so all you have to do is reach out!\n\nI guess my biggest advice when interviewing for any of the roles is to be passionate about the topic and be honest.\n\nMy biggest advice to you once you start working here is to get your name out there whenever possible, use common sense and do not take advantage of the trust given to you by your team and managers.", "cons": "Sometimes, it can feel way too formal and corporate, so you do not really discuss things with other employees on a more personal level."}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Solutions Engineer in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company with a superb team", "cons": "Growth problems.
