I worked from home almost the entire time I was there and loved it. They provide the tools you need to work from anywhere.\r\n- Excellent benefits; employee health insurance premiums are really low.\r\n- They employ some incredibly smart people, and I believe that the new CEO is going to do great things.\r\n- It's a fantastic company for engineers; they are the star employees.", "cons": "- They have a difficult history of annual layoffs, and the dust is still settling with the new CEO in place and the changes he's making to the organization.\r\n- Cisco is not generous with merit increases and promotions are difficult to come by.\r\n- Cisco is a behemoth of a company. As such, processes for getting anything done are complex and slow.\r\n- Don't expect a lot of handholding as you start your job. Cisco prides itself on being a \"self service\" company. That means you have to figure out how to get things done."}, {"review_title": "Good company to work for", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are a lot of business units in Cisco with a lot of projects, it's possible to move around to find team and project that suits one the best.

This is highly sales focussed company, Services are a poor relation and often driven with cost reductions. TAC are well funded thanks to lucrative support renewals.

Cost reduction appears to be high on the agenda and this impacts all aspects for a number of years now. Morale is poor and the People Deal they published is farcical considering the number of layoffs they constantly keep making. Promotions have not been communicated or transparent for a long, long time. No clear or defined career ladder either, this depends on what accounts and projects you get attached to tbh. Cisco appears to be trying to regenerate into a more youthful company to reduce costs but have lost a tremendous amount of industry experience and skills in doing so. Innovation is primarily hardware focussed. Very poor long term strategy or investment in Services, where the financials take precedence over quality, efficiency and innovation.
