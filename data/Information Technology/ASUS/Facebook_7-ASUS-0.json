Usually a company winter party (February) and a event in the summer (July).", "cons": "Lack of training \r\n- New products come out all the time and there is absolutely ZERO training on these products. You can acquire an item to test however it would take about 2-3 days to finally receive this unit. Due to the lack of training your customer support quality will suffer. If someone complains to management about the poor support, you will be to blame even though there is non-existent training. I cannot emphasize how ridiculous the lack of training here is. \r\n- When you start you are taught how to do 1 task, that is it. Everything else is up to you to ask/inquire about. \r\n-Requesting training is an option? Co-workers and myself have requested training on various products several times within the last year. It took nearly 7 months of constant requesting to receive 1 general tablet training. Expect Google to be your best training\r\n\r\nWork load\r\n- You will be given a mass amount of work. I believe I am a fast and efficient employee while maintaining quality and there are days where you will have 2-3 days of work to complete on 1 day. \r\n- Key Performance Index(KPI) - You will need to keep track of each assignment you do every day and log it. This means every phone call, every email, every chat, anything you do; you need to keep track of it otherwise you will not receive credit for doing them. This wastes a lot of time meanwhile you have several other tasks that you can be spending this valuable time on. Upper management has a target goal for you to reach, 100% of workload. They also say that it is not possible to hit 100%. What? How can I not hit 100% even if I am working as hard as I can? If you do hit 100% or close to it, they will adjust what they are expecting from you.\r\n\r\nEmployee's\r\n- Other team's are very lazy to help you out, but if they want some help they will not hesitate to ask.\r\n\r\nCompensation\r\n- There is 2 bonuses in the year depending on if you receive them (January/July) and 1 raise (July). It is not a guarantee that you will receive a bonus and or raise. If you are working in the service department do not expect a raise higher than 1 - 3%. Earning less than 40k a year this will come out to $400-$1200 at best.\r\n\r\nOpportunities at ASUS\r\n- Very low possibility of career growth at ASUS. If you work here for 2-3 years you might be able to move up to the manager of your direct team. After this step you will be unable to move any higher you can only move to another team.\r\n\r\nASUS Fremont Facility\r\n- Not very clean. Rats are known to be an issue here so do not put any type of snack or bars in your drawers.

So really, there\u2019s no function of the timer other than to monitor us: what time you get in, what time you leave, how long you take breaks and how much work you do.\n\nIt\u2019s funny to read comments by management here that says \u201cyou have to love your job to enjoy it\u201d and \u201cyou have to love and believe what you do.\u201d Is that best pitch they can give to bring up enthusiasm?

There's no staff welfare - being genuinely ill usually results in passive-aggressive attitude from your manager. The environment is toxic - there's very little opportunity to get some work done without someone actively trying to knife you in the back. \r\n\r\nOn the marketing side of the business, most of this is school playground politics (due to the average mental age of most of the sheep herded up to populate the marketing department), but there is the occasional Machiavel or psychopath who will play more subtle and damaging games for their own benefit. You therefore have to be careful of the often harmless-looking creatures who might deliver a ferocious bite when you least expect it. \r\n\r\nThe executives don't care about marketing. The marketing directors tend to just exist and are afraid to make the right decision in case they end up on the executives' chopping board. The company doesn't do proper market research, and the researchers aren't qualified to interpret any research they do correctly. \r\n\r\nIt's a very sales-driven organization, thus they adopt the 'throw a pan of spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks' strategy rather than working out what the market actually needs and making the best products possible. Thus, most of the products are full of short-cuts and the resulting poor user experiences - the executives try to be smart by saving a few cents, but end up being dumb with their dollars.\r\n\r\nThey are also unable to see the consequences to the bottom line of having too many products. In order to save money they employ inexperienced people to do jobs that are otherwise very important to the company, and under-resource every department. They get around the inexperience by having one of the three executives, Jonathan, shepherd the herd into a pen. They get around the lack of resources by expecting you to work from 9am to midnight during the week and then give up your weekends too.\r\n\r\nThe marketing strategy (what strategy?) is from a different millennia as a result and it tends to be \"do what competitor X did\", then when their sales drop the strategy is \"do what competitor Y did\". Jonathan's infamous FAB marketing meetings leave everyone feeling inadequate and like a bunch of imbeciles. One of the young marketers being forced to tears is not uncommon in these meetings. \r\n\r\nThe pay is terrible. The bonuses are not delved out according to you hitting your KPIs - it's more to do with your manager's whim and the company's performance in the month prior to bonuses being paid. Usually, there's a stock delay the month before the bonuses are paid - enough for the company to justify lowering bonuses to save money. Only for sales to bounce back by roughly the amount they dropped the following month. The benefits are also pretty shocking too, unless you count not having a life as a benefit of working for this company.\r\n\r\nThe CEO is the only product manager in this company. He couldn't make a decision and stick to it if his life depended upon it. And he can't keep his mouth shut at investor relations meetings, which makes it impossible to manage the flow of information out of the company.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you're not a native Taiwanese, you can forget about going anywhere in this company."}, {"review_title": "good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Nov 2015", "job_title": " in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "all were good, worrk performance was also good, there is no much work pressure nd also there is growth in company", "cons": "all are partial  , there is no much scope for improvement in the skills sets, management is not too formal"}, {"review_title": "HQ product marketing", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Feb 2016", "job_title": "HQ Product Marketing in Taipei", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You can work with a group of amazing people, and a boss that is always willing to teach you and give you chances to try on new things.
