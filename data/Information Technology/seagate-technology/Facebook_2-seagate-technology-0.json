There are some politics but just concentrate on your work and be friendly to everyone.

The seniors do not want to teach because they felt it was not their job and they just go on leave leaving you to fend for yourselves. Fortunately, somebody implemented some system to make our lives easier and they make us rotate our duties so the seniors also get to do other work. The new staff came and learned quickly in turn we teach each other and end up we teach each other which is great. It is a highly social place which will be great if you like to talk but talk and learn at the same time because nobody would care about you if you still do not know your stuff. It is quite a proactive job where you learn by asking so do not be afraid to ask.

There is a mismatch of expectations between management and engineers, so your contributions as an engineer will be either overlooked or used to pad your manager's portfolio. No exposure to other departments or senior management as an individual contributor, which means your career growth and opportunities are limited, unlike the high-flying execs who get promoted or rotated into new roles almost every other year. Rank-and-file staff stay stagnant in their cubicles at the same function for years (and your pay reflects that too).\r\n\r\nHire-and-fire mentality, hence engineering is seen as a cost centre and thus treated like a commodity to be scaled up or down as needed. Which is also why opportunities for engineers to move about are few and far between since the company sees no point in investing in a cost centre. Retrenchments and reorganisations will be on your colleagues' minds most of the time, which makes for a very gloomy atmosphere at work.\r\n\r\nColleagues are generally alright with the exception of those who gossip a lot or contact you outside of work for meaningless issues. Most coworkers are still friendly and helpful but don\u2019t expect a lot of product-specific knowledge transfer since everyone is protective of their portfolios, which affects their ricebowls. People generally keep to themselves here even though company events are conducted from time to time.\r\n\r\nCompared to other places I\u2019ve worked at, the onboarding process was done without much thought, and with outdated materials as well. Offboarding was done similarly haphazardly as well, with people contacting me for admin issues even after leaving the company.

I have personally learned a lot and this has been a key piece in my career to transit from University/postdoc into the industry.\r\n- Seagate encourages a nice and friendly environment with absolutely no blaming atmosphere (unless you are surrounded by toxic people -- that's my case)\r\n- You may find great people, in general managers are friendly and like they enjoy talking with employees. Most of managers have a human behaviour to the employees and care about their wellness.\r\n- In general, Seagate is setup on a way that you do not feel hierarchy, most of the times (unless you get a limiting manager). If you get a good innovative idea, you may get listened and your idea will be strongly supported (unless there is a toxic, jealous and reactive employee around you obsessed to stop your growth)\r\n- Most of the times you are surrounded by pro-active people willing to strongly support your idea and give as many resources as they can. Personally in my case, I got a nice mentorship by somebody who was fully committed with my success.\r\n- People with really good critical thinking skills willing to test your ideas.\r\n- I found that if you are at the right project and you work hard, you have a bright future in the company since Seagate offers you many opportunities as long as you are a pro-active person.\r\n- Relaxed work-environment (this might be also a bad thing as described in \"Cons\" section)\r\n- During COVID they have taken a really human and appropriate approach.\r\n- Personally, I think they pay is good since Derry/Londonderry's cost of life is low.\r\n- Seagate in Northern Ireland is recently doing a lot to improve.

The reasons are:\r\n- I have got badly harassed from an employee since the beginning. The reason, he was a \"career-stagnated\" employee who gets jealous when new employees join the company and start to \"shine\". Thus, these new employees might get promotion before the \"failing and stagnated\" employee, then that employee will harass and make bullying to the new starts. Personally, I have got harassed during 2 years, until I ended up in burn out and depression.\r\n- The harassment has been in many ways, trying to exclude from meetings and projects, verbally violent, blaming, physically violent as well (once thought I was going to get punched in the office) and has also sabotaged my work (personally once this employee has \"probably\" manually scratched my experiments/devices in order to make them un-usable and then needed to scrap my work).\r\n- In addition, all the time felt that person stand behind my screen looking at what I am doing and trying to continuously \"dirtily\" compete by copying my ideas, doing things in parallel instead of collaborating in order to \"win the competition\" (which does not really exist) and hiding information to the others or create fake data and results when not getting the right data to compete.\r\n- 80% of the time spent dealing with harassment and defending myself since the manager never solved the issue, 20% of the time spent doing engineering jobs. -- Personally, I have seen new starters, smart people, come to Seagate with a brilliant future, and their careers got completely pushed out by this person who just sneaks in their projects and violently pushes them out.\r\n- My manager had many chances to solve the issue since I communicated to him many times, however his actions were really vague. And most of the times he was bringing back the issue by, instead of separating me from that problematic employee, bringing him once and once again to the projects where I was working on.\r\n- My manager, despite the severe harassment issues, always discouraged me to report the issue to HR. I asked him several time to report to HR, but never wanted and came with sentences like \"if you report to HR this will have bad consequences and blablabla...\".\r\n- This makes me thing my manager might be more worried that everyone could be aware there is a problem in his team rather than really taking care that employees work effectively and they do not harass each other.\r\n\r\n- Another bad experience in Seagate, that is a minor reason for leaving but also important, is that in 8 months I haven't basically got any motivating work to do. Just got projects without any real reason \"to be\" or any utility which just got cancelled weeks later. This contributes also to the employee to feel meaningless in the company and pushes employees to leave. -- This is also a reason why Seagate can stagnate your career if you fall on a \"nothing to do\" blackhole."}, {"review_title": "review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Program/Project Manager in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good org to work with", "cons": "Nothing to say as of now"}, {"review_title": "Best Company for Professional Growth and Very Supportive to Personal/Family Life", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "26 May 2021", "job_title": "Staff Engineer in Derry, Northern Ireland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "State-of-art facility, numerous employee career progression opportunities, very supportive management, helping colleagues, generous bonus, fair salary increment, lots of technical & management related training courses, support financially for University Degrees by part time education, involved in a lot of charity work , blood donation camps, Employee Engagement activities.

Being in product development feels directionless with uncertain roadmaps and a lack of solid products to work on in the Singapore R&D center. Layoffs are also frequent, especially in 2020 when Covid struck, and colleagues were only informed near their last day with the company. Totally no transparency at all. Company still did alright and could afford to give high bonuses to shareholders and executives but if you aren't in the old boys' club you will always have to face constant restructuring and job uncertainty every year. Needless to say, general morale isn't good in there with many long-serving senior employees waiting for the inevitable to come.\r\n\r\nNo job mobility, and letting your manager know that you are interested in an open internal position is a red flag to your job security. Management claims to encourage mobility and reskilling into growth areas but does little to support your career growth. Loosing a subordinate through an internal transfer would jeopardize your manager's portfolio since their team would shrink, so they would put you up for layoff or give you a poor rating to justify letting you go so that they have a reason to bring in a fresh hire. Pay is also not competitive with market levels. Internal politics due to different teams wanting to keep their rice bowls means that knowledge transfer is few and far between. No work recognition at all and favoritism is oftentimes practiced, which means opportunities to grow and exposure to different roles and projects will not be shared equally if you are not in on it.\r\n\r\nJob progression is slow, and could be slower depending on your team and how vital the company views your work. Staying here for long would mean losing out to the general tech market rate and even losing out to the starting salaries of fresh grads. For young folks joining this company, stay for the experience of working in an established, but legacy, tech MNC but keep your skills and knowledge about the current tech stack current so that you can jump when better opportunities arise.\r\n\r\nThe lack of career and product visibility is made worse by the banning of TheLayoff.com and Glassdoor in the internal network (at least when I was in there), which should speak volumes about how Seagate treats feedback and complaints, whether they be genuine or not. People generally keep quiet about their misgivings for fear of offending someone with authority or influence who can easily crush their rice bowls."}, {"review_title": "Don't plan for long term", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Demand Planner in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Take ownership of products quickly", "cons": "There is no work life balance"}], [{"review_title": "Can do a whole lot better!", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "17 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Fremont, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Many talented people who are dedicated and care about what they do.", "cons": "Top level do not listen.
