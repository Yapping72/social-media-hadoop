I\u2019m forever grateful for the connections I made here and the people who supported me during my time with the company. I also had fantastic management (this is very team dependent) during my time at RH. The benefits here are decent. Pay is ok, but not nearly competitive to other companies. Remote work is supported and seamless. The addition of recharge days this last year was great! PTO is generous.", "cons": "I can easily spot fake reviews plastered here. I\u2019ve also been tracking the reviews lately and as of last month when you filtered reviews by demographics it was very clear how women and marginalized groups felt internally. This gap magically closed overnight? My strong recommendation for job seekers is to sort reviews by the lowest ratings and pay attention to the common trends/dates when making your decision. Also, ask LOTS of really direct questions in your interviews!!\n\nThe culture that was pitched to me in interviews and promoted ad nauseam internally was not at all what I saw or experienced. RH is by far the most toxic work environment I\u2019ve ever been in! Sexism, racism, and nepotism are not only rampant, but blatantly overt. RH prides itself on being diverse and inclusive (it says so on the website!), but internally that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. This is still very much a white-male dominated environment with a strong bro culture. All of the affinity groups RH is so proud of just serve as therapy gatherings for marginalized employees. There is zero transparency into promotions and pay, as a result meritocracy is pretty much a joke here. Gender pay gaps are real. If you work in departments outside of engineering, your opinions won\u2019t matter. Engineering rules all at RH and they\u2019ve been allowed to essentially dictate how the other departments run. As a result it is pure chaos and departments have zero autonomy to make decisions and changes to benefit their employees. This overarching engineering control consistently fuels fighting between departments/BUs over seemingly everything. It also fuels departmental silos...and even more so along product lines. I had to force/beg for cross-departmental collaboration and spent so much time forcing people to work together and think outside their bubble. I never succeeded with engineering. They were content doing it their way and their way meant all the supporting teams were kept in the dark and then bashed repeatedly for not \u201ckeeping up\u201d with them. If you like structure and process, RH is NOT the place for you. It\u2019s not merely about keeping up in a fast-paced environment and being agile\u2026.you\u2019ll need to survive in pure turmoil. Company direction changes all the time. There are no clear roadmaps for some of the products. No solid go-to-market strategies. Engineering will deliver functionality without including QE/Docs, because those departments are always drowning and behind. Support teams are understaffed and flailing. We STILL let customers toss money at us and shift to focus on that vs building stability into our products. Tooling in departments supporting engineering is mediocre at best. You\u2019ll sit in hundreds of meetings to discuss something and then zero action will come of it. The internal dysfunction makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to just do your job.\n\nOutside the general internal dysfunction, the bulk of my poor negative experience at RH was directly the result of sexism from male colleagues. A lot of the constant issues I faced boiled down to a toxic culture and management chains that don\u2019t know how to advocate for their teams properly. As much as we promote \"teamwork\", RH leadership is more focused on keeping/owning control of their functional areas vs being a part of the larger team. A lot of self-serving exists in leadership. If I'm honest, my biggest regret was not leaving this company sooner. I should\u2019ve left after the first time I brought up toxic/sexist behavior and watched it get swept under the rug. And months later when I watched male peers from across the company support the gender pay gap and marginalize women OPENLY on a company-wide mailing list, it should've been my cue to go. I saw all I needed to see here."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Technical Support Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work here.

As much as one may want to downsell this after working here, this name still ensures you will get calls from recruiters at better companies with much better engineering cultures. For now, this is true. Next year? Who knows. Big Blue acquisitions have never ended well.\r\n\r\nThere are few good engineers, especially at principal level or above. If you get to work with the really good ones who have a track record of shipping impactful projects, it would be a good plus in your career. Not every engineer at this designation is good though, so watch out for the not-so-obvious rotten apples, because there are a lot of them.\r\n\r\nWork life balance is ok. Your manager would usually care if you are clocking a lot of hours, but then again at same time, he may not care whether you are fulfilling your potential and having a great career. He might actually not  give a damn about those. Some of the work can be busy work created by lack of direction from the very top.", "cons": "Many downsides to working here. I won't recommend this company even to anyone I don't know, much less the people I know and care about. Absolutely, no way.\r\n\r\nSo, where to begin?\r\nVP and Directors are pretty much lacking in providing direction to the company. This is a company that missed reaping major benefits from every major technological change that occurred right under it's nose. Sure, the company has engineers who write software that runs on public clouds and mobiles. But why work in this company if the direction is set by other companies? Talk about lost potential and a misguided sense of doing something useful as an engineer. There are other companies that can take your inputs, and take them to fruition, while enabling you all the way. Competitors have better track records at launching products with customer validation, and with much less fanfare and self-adulation.\r\n\r\nThe entire top brass, from VP and Director level, to the CXOs, ought to have their performance examined for the past 10 years. People and employees who were better at providing direction have moved on, long time ago. The ones currently remaining have been here for long, have learnt nothing from failures, haven't been held accountable for stagnating product lines and failure to create new product lines. And morale is bad. Engineers quit mostly because they fail to find a sense of purpose and ownership, which they eventually get at other companies.\r\n\r\nProduct management culture is absent and abysmal. In the several years I worked here, I had never met a competent product manager who could sell his vision to engineering teams. Lot of PMs winging their way around, with product success not attributable to them. This place has a lot of failed products, and there is a history of rebranding and embedding such failures in other products, to provide a sense of utility and not have work go to waste. Reflections and postmortems are either not done, or done for the sake of hiding failures under the rug.\r\n\r\nSo, you not only get to see poor people management that demoralizes you, you also get bad product management, with the end result that you would spend hours working on features that aren't relevant. It can't get any worse than this.\r\n\r\nClueless engineers enable this culture, by not demanding accountability from key stakeholders to ensure staff deliver impact. Some are busy fighting over minutiae and trifles on memo list. Some others enable bad management by brainwashing other staff into thinking the culture is fine, and as if this were normal at a growing successful company. And a few other engineers at very senior positions have pet projects that you might end up working, by accident, where there is no meaningful and measurable impact, with all round bad decision making. You get to know of this lack of impact and the damage it does to your career, only when you've assessed yourself against peers - until then, you're just as clueless and brainwashed.\r\n\r\nI mentioned memo list. That mailing list is probably a reflection of how the company has lost its way, chasing its own tail, while other companies have emerged as better and more desirable places to work at.\r\n\r\nThis company has devolved into a laggard that focuses on selling support for software to other laggard companies. What was the last piece of software sponsored by this company, that was the choice for a new emerging startup? Did any of the projects here eventually go on to create outsized impact, that resulted in the Googles and Amazons taking notice? No. You'll struggle to find answers. If you are quitting Red Hat, better hope your recruiter doesn't find out about this.\r\n\r\nBad pay. When I worked here, appraisals were done every 18 months, and there was a good chance you would get a cost of living increase for great performance where you had to break your back, work with asinine coworkers, and deal with clueless managers. Slap in the face. One of my managers discovered this small concept of inflation and how ideally pay rises had to factor for inflation, some 20+ years into his career. Spoke volumes about how compensation is treated as a subject in this company. Avoid.\r\n\r\nRun like hell like your life depended on it - I did, just too late, and it took years of hard work to negate the shortfalls of working here. You are going to be doing much better work elsewhere, rather than this place that advertises heavily but has very little to show for."}, {"review_title": "Company with world wide best culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Sales Director in Z\u00fcrich", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Company with growth year by year, sales targets achievable, great team spirit, great culture, loved by every customer", "cons": "25% increase of quota every year, more and more competitive landscape, acquired by IBM"}, {"review_title": "Still here after 5+ years", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Principal Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Open culture, people are passionate.", "cons": "As with any big company, politics can be frustrating."}, {"review_title": "idk", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Software Quality Engineer in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- a good environment\r\n- best place for minorities \r\n- good challenges", "cons": "- misinformation but just sometimes"}], [{"review_title": "Great Company!!!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Senior Systems Engineer in Westford, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work life experience at company", "cons": "Could pay a little bit higher"}, {"review_title": "Diverse Organization", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Data Scientist in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The culture at Red Hat is great and something it\u2019s well known for.", "cons": "There are only a Data Science roles"}, {"review_title": "Very nice", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Brno", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everything is great.

Where career growth can be difficult at Red Hat is if you have been here for several years, potentially in different departments, you can find yourself having to take lateral moves just to \"develop your career\" this really hinders your ability to continue to grow your salary range due to the company policy of only a certain max percentage can be given for promotion at any given time.

The result is a bitter feud on the company-wide mailing list, with too much repetition of the same tired arguments citing dictionary definitions and the \u201coffense\u201d of totalitarian-like language control. The problem, of course, is that the people making these arguments refuse to understand that tradition and dictionaries were created by the class that did the oppressing and that it\u2019s time to give voice to the oppressed. Watching this conversation devolve has been incredibly demoralizing.\r\nThen there\u2019s the fundamental concept of the open decision framework, which calls for transparency and inclusivity in decision making. In practice, at least in my department, key decisions are still made in an isolated, top-down manner by one or two department leaders, often not even eliciting feedback from other department leaders, resulting in confusion, toxic fallout from the associates negatively impacted by the decision, and often multiple efforts going on at cross purposes because one group doesn\u2019t know what another is doing. \r\nOverall, I do not recommend Red Hat as a place to work, and I am seeking to get out as soon as I can."}, {"review_title": "Great opportunity to enhance career skills", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Channel Sales", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fantastic people, good work life balance and competitive benefits", "cons": "Still developing a strong go to market channel strategy"}, {"review_title": "Red Hat is a great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "10 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Senior Software Quality Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You have the freedom to choose what you want to work on!

There are too many to list here. \r\n\r\nRed Hat is a one-of-a-kind organization. Period. And it's an honor to be a part of their tremendous growth.\r\n\r\nPerks/Compensation: On a basic employee level, the compensation is significantly higher than any other organization around. The benefits are everything you could hope for, and they are constantly asking us, the associates, for feedback and other ways to improve. \r\n\r\nCulture: The OpenSource culture they foster here is amazing and fosters a sense of camaraderie, transparency, and togetherness. This is reflected even within the sales organization, where the sales team mentality is \"win-as-one\" without the typical corporate cutthroat, hierarchical/competitive sales culture. And if you ever need help, there's no end of colleagues willing to assist you. \r\n\r\nWork/Life balance: Everyone is working from home right now for the foreseeable future, but most Account Executives before the pandemic were remote and frequently traveling for customer meetings. Although at the higher levels of the sales structure you'll see a lot of traveling, Red Hat has always been committed to telling us \"family/personal life first, work second\". You can see that evidenced in their recent \"recharge days\", where they have given almost ever associate a random day off, just to help with mental health and general wellness during these trying times. \r\n\r\nGoals/Mission: We have high goals and standards, but we are given all of the tools to meet them. And there's a TON of upward/cross mobility here--if you are looking for a career and a place to grow as a professional, this is where you belong. Upper management has the mission to increase our size by x3 within the next few years, so I'm betting there's going to be a ton of changes but a plan of action that will absolutely get us there. \r\n\r\nSenior Leadership: Red Hat's senior leadership is virtually flawless. Their response to COVID has been one of the most humane and comforting out of any organization I've heard to date. They are transparent as possible and I truly trust their direction and decisionmaking. \r\n\r\nTLDR; As things stand, I will be a lifelong Red Hat employee because of the ways I have been treated in this organization.", "cons": "It can be stressful at times with high goals and high quotas, especially during a recession/pandemic, but the way the company has handled these changes and offered enormous help will make me a lifelong employee and advocate.\r\n\r\nManagement can be stressed at times and sometimes they can reflect that stress in team meetings, but in my experience, they are quick and willing to engage in a useful dialog to remedy the situation.

Nothing sticks out. \r\n- Opensource,  although you can work in opensource in many companies\r\n- Lots of training available. If you are at a site, you can get all the training/certifications you want for free as long as the classroom has space. But there are no travel dollars for this. If you are remote, this is somewhat of a con. There is a fairly large amount of online training, but nothing that will lead to a cert.\r\n- Smart tech people, but there are smart people everywhere. \r\n- The shutdown days have been made into company holidays, so you don't have to burn PTO and essentially get 4 more days off. The con on this is that if you carry over PTO into the following year, you must use it by Feb 15th. If you don't use it, you lose it. Yeah, this is actually a con for many people.\r\n- Easy to get promoted up to senior level. Promotions are a dime a dozen at the lower levels. Everybody gets promoted.  I've seen some people get promoted who really shouldn't be. Principal level is harder, but the domain you work in can make the principal promotion easier. For example you would have to almost be Torvald's deputy to get a principal promotion in kernel space.  See cons.", "cons": "- Equity grants practically non-existent now. No longer have a new hire grant. Retention grants may hit 1 out of 10 employees now and they are so small as to be about $2000 in stock per year. Likely the driver for the new ESPP program.\r\n- Many management new hires from large behemoth companies. They don't fit here and have created a management versus worker mentality rather than the previous one team mentality. It's ironic because they bring the stuff that didn't work from their old jobs and make Red Hat like the company they left. The \"old-timers\" who have been promoted to management still walk the talk, but are pressured by these new people and all the junk/process they bring with them.\r\n- Strange PTO policy. After 5 years you get 3 more days, 10 years another 3 more. \r\n- There is favoritism. Buddies get the promotions, the money, and the opportunities.\r\n- Low pay. No formal salary merit increase policy. Your salary used to be reviewed every June, but no more. Seems to be just whenever your manager feels like it. So if you have a cost cutting penny pincher new hire manager from one of those large companies, chances are you won't see an increase and are underpaid. I've heard it may be an 18 mo cycle now, but haven't seen evidence that it's in operation. Besides why 18 months versus a standard 12 month year?\r\n-  There is talk that the bonus could go the way of the equity grants.  Sounds like something Frank would want and since he is gone now,  this may not materialize.\r\n- No promotion path after principal. Very few senior principals+ in engineering and non-existent in the support side of the house. The unfortunate result is there is no career path after principal. I've seen quite a few top level people (committers and the like) leave and this along with the other cons is why (particularly the culture change from the new managers).\r\n- Used to get the tools to do our jobs. No longer do development/tech employees get workstations. You used to get a laptop and a workstation, but no longer. You get a laptop. The result is people self fund their hardware.

The stuffs anyone doing at Red Hat (Pune) could have been done in the current role outside Red Hat. Just that one does not believe enough.

The assistance from manager is only in words and they never care to fulfill them. Managers here only want you to pick up cases from the new case queue OR/AND give some non sensical session on any technical topic so that their name is there on the monthly Ops review session that under x supervisor , associate y gave some training. In simple terms, you have a manager/supervisor who can do harm but no good. Also most of the managers are non technical and fail to comprehend the engineers' feedback.\r\n\r\n2) Bonus :- You have a system of quarterly bonus. Its actually 10% annually which comes out to be 2.5% for a quarter. Now, if you close more than 80-90 cases per month for all the months in a quarter ONLY then you may expect to receive a bonus of 100%. This 100% is again in proportion to what your team is entitled to. So for example, after a quarter's end, a team is entitled to only 90% of the bonus (given the fact that the team closed less number of cases) so the associate who worked like a superman/bahubali shall actually receive  comparatively  a lesser share of 100% of the team's 90% as opposed to him receiving 100% of 100% of the team.\r\n\r\n3)  People :- There are some old players (basically TSEs and STSEs) who are technically not worthy of their positions and always cry about their \"low salaries\".  However, these people have good influence over the leadership (strictly at the supervisor level only). Out of 100, there are ONLY AND NOT MORE THAN 5-7 people on an average who are worth interacting.\r\n\r\n4) Salary :- Depends upon how you fair up in the interview and the requirement of the position. I've heard that Red Hat Pune is expanding but the new hires are getting lesser salary than the ones hired as recent as 6 months back. Usually they do not offer more than 30% and in some cases worse.\r\n\r\n5)  Quality of the associates :- Average or worse. Roughly, there would be only 1 or max 2 persons in any team \r\nwho would be just about good for answering questions of any level of complexity for cases in their respective queue . Rest all others are a shameless.\r\n\r\n6) Other :-\r\na) Supervisors here all the time want their associates to give exhaustive sessions for the entire Pune region. Sometimes (infact most of the times) this approach is meaningless.\r\nb) No onsite opportunities.\r\nc) You can't use MSoffice or windows.\r\nd) You have to jump in all issues of any complexity at any given moment."}, {"review_title": "Great place to gain relevant technical expertise", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Consultant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Red Hat is constantly growing their products and integrating features enterprises care about.

I think even first-level managers still can get stock options, but the chance for real wealth has past. Most of these cons apply to most corporate jobs. I improved my Excel skills to even higher levels. I didn't learn or improve other valuable skills that I can make money with, so personal growth was  limited. I was praised for my effort and results, but never rewarded with more money, more time, or better work. I discovered my marginal earnings / hour were better managing my personal investments and fulfilling orders and improving the efficiency of my own little business during lunch, so I quit after 1 year. My managers said they were sad when I announced I wanted to leave, but didn't offer anything more to keep me. I think actions speak louder than words, and Red Hat's actions said it only valued me as a $28/hr (pre-tax) / $21/hr (post-tax) Excel and salesforce.com jockey. Red Hat offered no way of improving me into a higher-value role, so I left.

So the mail app is gmail and other products are gchat, google calendar, google drive. Again this is kind of advantage and disadvantage. For Example at 11 PM you will be watching something on Netflix, your work mail just gives you a notification. You just open the mail, respond to it and go back to your show.

You need a Apple Magic mouse (costs RS. 7000), here you go. Literally anything as far as you use it for red hat.\r\n10. Everyone here use whatsapp for official chat. Make sure you have two mobile numbers one of personal and other for work.\r\n11. You have red hat University site for free, where you get 1000's of courses online. Not satisfied with that? No problem, you have Linked in Learning for free. Still not ok? Here you go, you have $ 2000 every year for your learning. Use it to do online course, Higher studies... Anything....
