You are thrown into the thick of it with little to no training. I have been yelled at and abused my my merchants for things out of my control. \r\n\r\nYou are expected to work 24/7, even if they don't explicitly say that. The work keeps piling up and there's no hope for relief. Shopify gave all of it's employees friday's off, but what they don't tell you is that you will end up working those days anyways due to the influx of merchant requests.\r\n\r\nThe job is way too ambiguous, and you end up just acting like customer support. Nobody I know signed up to be customer support but we were all lied too. We were never told that we'd have to answer complex theme questions or help troubleshoot API's. Most people joining this role think they're becoming a Customer Success Manager, not a support person. \r\n\r\nEvery night i go to sleep afraid to wake up and to go to work. Working at Shopify has made me feel like a prisoner in my own home. It sounds overdramatic, but I sit in fear of the next email that will come into my inbox. Working here has been the most stressed that i've ever been in my life. I never get to eat my lunch because it's just work work work. There's no work/life balance. Your work IS your life now. I can't leave my house without bringing my work laptop with me, even during a trip to the cottage. My friends and family have been worried about me since i've been working so late every night. \r\n\r\n There is definitely a popular clique(cult) at Shopify, and if you're not in it, there will be no career progression for you. Also there are very unfair differences and division of work between teams, ie some teams have never used their email before, never talk to merchants but somehow get to have game nights and pizza parties while getting paid more. \r\n\r\nDo not believe the hype that you see on linkedin, the culture sucks. most people are overworked.

At the same time, some teams are more lenient and even take syntax errors lightly.\r\n\r\nWork-life imbalance, especially after they went remote. \r\n\r\nSome employees/teams have strange expectations. Say, your task depends on a senior member from another team. You might be blamed for delays caused by that member.\r\n\r\nUnequal treatment of employees in certain teams, e.g. a lead or a senior developer can break prod with their mistake and the team laughs it off, while a junior developer can be criticized for small things like code-style preferences. When I needed help understanding some vaguely described issues, nobody was available to reply to my messages. However, I was surprised to see that even the busiest team member would take time to help the other noob that joined. Not only by replying to their messages, but by even jumping on a pair-programming session.\r\n\r\nSome teams are not open/ready to accept new members, e.g. if they don't like you, they won't reply to your messages or GitHub comments, they'll take weeks to review even the simplest PR you write, they won't hesitate to make a big issue out of any small mistake you might make.\r\n\r\nDoesn't matter if you get your work done and work hard to meet the team's expectations (growth mindset), if you don't have a certain \"je ne sais quoi\", the team will not cooperate with you.\r\n\r\nSome teams are not good at communicating, e.g. vague comments on PRs which might take 15-30 mins to decipher. E.g., someone might post a vague comment about something and if you try to address that comment by changing your code, they might post a follow-up comment saying, \"you don't have to change the code just because I suggested\". Additionally, delay in PR reviews can make you feel useless and makes it look as if you're taking more time to do your work.\r\n\r\nImproper feedback might lead you down the wrong path, e.g. I was always told by my lead that I was \"on the right track\", until the last month when they suddenly sent me a warning to terminate my employment.\r\n\r\nFinally, if they put you on probation, chances are that they've already decided to terminate you. I did my performance-evaluation task way before the deadline that was assigned to me, but I was terminated despite that. And... I wasn't even asked for my feedback when I was being terminated.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I've never had such a strange experience in the 10+ years of my career. Again, maybe it's all my fault.

People for whom this is their first job, or have never worked anywhere else are easily bought. Shopify is shiny, but when you look closely it\u2019s brass, not gold. \n\n2. If you have a voice, don\u2019t use it. They want you to think how they think- they hire the best bright minds and then extinguish them. They hire skilled HR Directors and then bring them in as a BP. They tell you to forget what you know, because Shopify is \u201cdifferent\u201d. I would encourage anyone taking a job on the HR team to REMEMBER what you\u2019ve learned, because that\u2019s the only way to get your job done. The team is disconnected, burned out, and no one speaks up out of fear. Processes are broken or non existent. Every AMA with HR leadership has anonymous questions because no one wants to be identified and then targeted for having an opinion that is different. \n\n3. You will absolutely burn out. The demands are incredibly and unreasonably high - there is minimal recognition and they don\u2019t pay anyone in HR enough to put up with the disregard for their wellness and mental health. For a billion dollar company, this is an area in which they MUST do better. \n\n4. If you\u2019re reading reviews, you\u2019ve read that management is terrible. There are some good folks that know how to lead, but they are needles in a haystack. They have a great leadership training program but not enough people to lead it."}, {"review_title": "Good company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Perks, Benefits, Culture, Friendly coworkers, Remote", "cons": "Huge knowledge base\r\nPush to get payment upgrades"}, {"review_title": "great freelance opportunity", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Web Developer in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "remote woking and freelance opportunities", "cons": "finding high paying clients to work with"}, {"review_title": "Great place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome culture that encourages growth", "cons": "None I can think of right now"}, {"review_title": "You will burnout eventually so get your own support", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "3 May 2021", "job_title": "Customer Support Advisor in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.

I personally think it's the most exciting place to work in Canada and love working here. Here's why:\r\n\r\nMeaningful work making an impact to users. The company has a clear goal and you're contributing significantly. You get to make improvements & provide value to the user's lives which is very rewarding.\r\n\r\nI've been encouraged to grow in terms of skills. I've learned Ruby on Rails, which I didn't know at all before. I've given a talk in front of a large group & wrote a blog post, neither of which I've ever done before and never imagined I would. This place can really encourage growth & improvement. Even though I'm a front end developer, there have been no issues with me doing some back end work or helping on other projects. It's all on GitHub and open to pull requests (feels like open source within the company).\r\n\r\nWith thousands of smart & talented people in a culture where they can do amazing things & innovate, amazing products are created. The people here are very talented & helpful. Everyone supports & roots for each other. On Slack, we celebrate each other's accomplishments. Most of the people here could work anywhere. Many come from start ups in Toronto or moved from different parts of the world to work here.\r\n\r\nThere are many opportunities to get to know others & work with them, for example Fancy Friday lunches once a month where you go to out to lunch with others (paid for by Shopify). Or a system that randomly matches you with others for lunch. Hack Days is another great chance to work with people you don't normally work with.\r\n\r\nEven though it's a big company, there is little bureaucracy. There is tons of internal communication where everyone shares what they're doing and everyone can ask any question and get an answer quickly. We're constantly doing things & telling people so that people are inspired & get feedback or help if needed.\r\n\r\nCompensation is high with public stock, something many other Canadian tech companies can't offer.\r\n\r\nGreat offices, food is usually good, house-cleaning perk. Sometimes I come into work and there's someone cooking fresh eggs for you. Book bars where you can borrow some interesting books. Internal podcasts!\r\n\r\nPersonally, I've never had to work evenings or weekends. Work from home & hours flexibility (can avoid rush hour on subway).\r\n\r\nTooling is great: Github, Slack, with many integrations & reasonable processes. Because there are several cities, there are many cross-location meetings, but with google hangouts & livestream infrastructure it's painless.\r\n\r\nReally amazing employee conferences/events like Summit, opportunity to travel to other offices.\r\n\r\nEven though there's free beer/wine/drinks, it's not a very drink-heavy culture. There's no obligation to stay late for things like hack days, so I find it very inclusive for those in different life situations. People may have a beer or glass of wine during town-hall meetings, but I haven't seen it ever go too far.\r\n\r\nThe employee population is diverse by gender, race, age & life situation, although it may skew younger than many larger corporations. Many women in leadership roles.\r\n\r\nAs with other tech companies, love that we can wear anything to work (shorts, hoodies, t-shirts).\r\n\r\nYou're always encouraged to give your honest opinion (in a respectful way), even if it challenges others.\r\n\r\nIf you're a developer, how cool is it that the CEO wrote the original code for this big Rails app that tons of people run their businesses on?", "cons": "Growth rate is extremely high. After a few months, many on your team are newer than you. This is both exciting & has challenges. Each team or group can be different or have different processes, so my perspective might not be representative of all experiences working here. I've been here about 1 year and many are newer than me.\r\n\r\nThere's a good on boarding process but I personally found Ruby on Rails to have a bit of a steep learning curve, coming from a JS background. Having said that, there is a lot of support and I've been able to learn it & contribute.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 separate buildings in Toronto. The buildings are all nice but one of them is a bit of a walk away from the others, so you may not see people from there as often.\r\n\r\nWith multiple cities (Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, Montreal, SF), groups can feel fractured, but travel, Slack & remote meetings can mitigate this.\r\n\r\nThose coming from more traditional companies might experience some culture shock by how casual & laid back it is here, but I think it's pretty standard for a tech & Silicon Valley style company. I've always worked in tech (in Canada) so things like sandals at work or beer at work is not shocking for me personally.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of autonomy & freedom which can be good for some, but an adjustment for others.

From a high performer perspective, it\u2019s tough to be coached by someone you know you can do the job better than.

If someone is putting up metrics that are equivalent to the work of 2 or 3  people,  should they be getting paid only slightly more than the weakest link?\r\n- 30 min lunch is too short in my opinion. The issue is that scaling an extra 15 or 30 mins across hundreds of employees equates to a serious loss of productivity. I still think it would be worth it for employee morale, but there\u2019s no data to show that.\r\n- Middle management and upper-middle management have some blind spots when it comes to the front line.

I realized very early that, Guru's are not paid nearly as much as they deserve - considering the amount of work that we do. Your bi-weekly pay will be around 1,250 (if you are working in Ontario). I know some may be like, \u201cthats not bad, why the complaints,\" it\u2019s really hard to explain exactly what the job entails, because of how much I do - I would be writing an essay, but I know for sure it is definitely not enough. \r\n\r\nTraining Experience: \r\n\r\nI was part of a training pilot which was only 4 weeks long. Usually, training for Guru's is 6 weeks, but they shorted it to 4 for my team, as a \u201ctest.\u201d I believe this really negatively impacted me as a Guru, not only in terms of preparedness when I hit live channels, but also what was expected of me in my role.  \r\n\r\nDuring training, it was a constant race against time. My trainer was always rushing, always cutting things short or giving us unreasonable deadlines because there wasn't enough time to truly go through all the content. I found myself skimming through the Bridge Courses (course readings) because there was simply never enough time to fully read through them. At times, this resulted in me having to spend 2-4 hours completing tasks that were suppose to be done in training, on my own time after work. Which isn't really ideal nor is it fair. Furthermore, you only have a few days to learn how to navigate 3 chats at once. This may sound like \"oh a fews days, not bad\" but in reality it requires a lot more time/practice, it not as easy as it seems, it is actually very stressful. The questions in chats, can be extremely complex considering how dynamic the platform is. You are also required to take notes for every ticket, reach out to live channels, and do follow-up emails, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem. Most of the questions I have received in chats, I did not learning training, it required my own research during the live chat. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, another common rumour about Shopify is that is it easy to move up. During training, you have various people from different teams that chat to you about how they moved up to different teams. One thing they all have in common is that they \u201cstarted as guru\u2019s, just like you.\u201d I can\u2019t even begin to explain how many times I heard that phrase. Actually, it is not that easy to move up. I witnessed members of my team (who have been there 3-4 years) mentioning they would love to move to other teams - eg. Risk or Theme Support. They would ask about steps and how they can reach their goals. Squad Leads and trainers, literally say \u201cMaster the Guru role first.\u201d Which to some degree I understand, how can you move on to another role is you haven\u2019t mastered your current role. The thing is though, you can never really \u201cmaster the Guru role,\u201d you can never know everything about the Guru role because of how dynamic the role is. Instead, it\u2019s really based on who you know and how likeable you are. It really depends on your Squad Lead, they stand between you and your goal. \r\n\r\nManagement Attitudes/Guidance: \r\n\r\nAs the weeks began to draw closer to my time to hit live channels solo, I became extremely anxious, I knew I wasn\u2019t ready and I felt extremely unprepared. I was struggling in my mentored chats, and also just struggling with what my role was and how to answer merchant questions. It was not only me who felt this way. I remember a peer on my training team, literally saying in a video call, \u201cI do not feel prepared, there are a lot of Guru horror stories about this feeling, how do I navigate this, how can you guys help me?\u201d Our lead, completely dodged the question. The answer was, \u201call starting guru\u2019s feel this way,\u201d and he later sent her a video on how to manage stress. That is the problem with Shopify. They do not take Guru concerns seriously or at all. I was feeling burnout during my training and I am still feeling it now as a regular Guru, and no one actually addresses this issue head on. Instead, they glaze over it with comments like, \u201ceveryone feels this way,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re not managing your stress properly,\u201d \u201cmaybe this isn\u2019t the job for you,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re not being resourceful enough,\u201d THIS IS NOT OKAY. By doing this, Shopify is taking accountability off of themselves, and placing on the Guru, this is extremely dismissive, toxic, and not an appropriate way to address/solve concerns. This type of dismissive behaviour, has really had a negative impact on my mental health. I know that the employer comment to this is going to be something like, \u201cSurprised to hear this, we take our employee\u2019s mental health seriously, we try to provide the best training and support, blah blah blah,\u201d I know this is what you believe in and strive for, but it is not actually how it manifests. I am constantly feeling like I am not good enough at my job, that this job isn\u2019t for me, that my feelings aren\u2019t valid, that my stress is my own fault. It wasn\u2019t until recently that I realized, these are all things I heard from Shopify Leads, as a way to shift accountability and not actually address issues within the structure of the Guru role. The feelings Guru\u2019s are having, speak more to the training/support not being as effective as it should be, it is not solely the Guru."}, {"review_title": "Learning Designer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Learning Designer in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of freedom, lots of perks, lots of opportunities, great variety of people, very conscious of diversity and inclusion, great culture", "cons": "lack of direction from my leads about what was expected of me, lack of vision from my leads around what the team needed to do, lack of communication around performance management, lack of support from my leads when I was having personal issues, lack of experience from my leads around people management."}], [{"review_title": "Decent work environment with limited career growth opportunities", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Sept 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Equipment provided for work is of great quality.\r\n-Benefits and perks are improving year on year.\r\n-Remote work and all the perks that come from that.\r\n-Strong support structure for employees.\r\n-A lot of emphasis on skills development.\r\n-Exciting company mission.", "cons": "-Two class system between remote employees and in-office employees.

Everyone is so caring and everyone helps you out as much as they can. And trust me when I say that you're not a number here. I spoke with some CEO's and Directors and they're normal people like us, they'll listen to you and they will take your feedback very very seriously. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\n1. Working from home\r\n- I never thought that working from home will be so fun and relaxing. After spending 5 hours a day on commute on previous job, working from home came as God given! More time with family and kids, drastic saving either on public transport or on car fuel and no more spending \u20ac10-15 on lunch in cantina. \r\n\r\n2. Amazing colleagues and Team Managers\r\n- These people will give their hearts out to help you out, and no backstabbing!\r\n\r\n3. Perks and benefits\r\n- Every year you get a significant amount of \u20ac bonus (trust me when I say significant) to expense it as you want it. \r\n- Fully covered private health care and full paid by Shopify\r\n- 20 days of holidays and 10 personal days (call it sick days but they aren't) so technically you have 30 working days of leave. \r\n\r\n4. Professional development\r\n- If you want to learn more about your job or if you think that an online course or a book will help you out, Shopify will cover the expenses. \r\n\r\n5. Loads of training each week that you get allocated outside of live channels or Professional Development time too. \r\n\r\n6. Salary\r\n- Salary is amazing when comparing same role with Apple. I'm not going to mention Amazon as they are paying peanuts compared to Shopify and they don't brainwash you like the others. \r\n\r\nJust to add, this isn't a manager review, I'm a Guru here in Ireland and my family means everything to me! I used to commute 5 hours a day before Shopify to bring bread in our house, my little kids didn't even see me, in morning when I would leave nor in evening when I would come back home. \r\n\r\nMy relationship with my children has drastically improved because I'm working from home and you're always there for them if anything happens!\r\n\r\nI know that some other reviewers will complain about Social life balance because we're working from home. If someone isn't capable of going out to a pub or to call their friend to meet up after they finish their shift then something is really wrong with these people. \r\n\r\nAnd I've been super productive while working from home, no dress code...nothing.

I shouldn\u2019t need to elaborate but let me, No matter how long you\u2019re here three chats is a daunting task and creates an extremely poor service especially as many merchants want their issue solved immediately. Imagine having to chat with three people, launch their stores, their admin etc, troubleshoot their issue or find info and then having to try business coach them towards the end of the chat it\u2019s simply too stressful and borders near impossible for many. Some people might like it but two should be the Max and opt into three if you\u2019re comfortable as opposed to pressuring people into three. Calls are somewhat nicer as at least then you\u2019re only dealing with one person so you have breathing space. \r\n\r\nThroughout training and mentoring you\u2019re given rather vague feedback and told you\u2019re doing great to only then go into guruland and be ripped apart by your squad lead. Who will tell you it\u2019s normal to know very little but then absolutely obliterate you for not knowing something and providing inadequate support. There\u2019s simply no win! Escalated teams don\u2019t work on live channels so everyone is rushing to get into those squads. This again creates a pretty harsh environment for gurus as you cannot simply escalate a problem and see it\u2019s sorted quickly. \r\n\r\nThe platform itself does seem well designed but has far too many flaws and allows dare I say too much customisation? This is fine for those who are actually able to code but 9 time out of 10 it is somebody following a help article that gets it wrong, contacts support, support don\u2019t know how to code so are reading from the exact same help document and stressing themselves because they don\u2019t know the answer. It\u2019s toxic and really hard to deal with. \r\n\r\nThere is zero pay for working extra hours, which is expected. Especially as you begin with the company a lot of your live interactions will be pushed to emails as you simply don\u2019t know the answer. This in turn leads to a huge personal queue which you have 45 mins to get through, 15 mins in the morning and 30 in the evening.  I have often had to stay way past my shift finish time as this \u201cget it done\u201d culture is embraced despite the stress and work life imbalance it creates. \r\n\r\nThere is so much more I could say here but writing this even makes me stressed and sad. I don\u2019t see myself lasting much longer in the role, the stress and pressure is too much and unfortunately this is common right across the company.

I was very disappointed to discover how this company turned out be.\r\n\r\nDespite the efforts Shopify makes in taking care of their employees and despite their thorough and comprehensive interview process, the sole opinion of your team lead is enough to get you fired. The positive relationships you've built both within and outside your team are overruled by the opinion of this one employee with reasons that are misguided, exaggerated, and misunderstood.\r\n\r\nYour motivation and work ethic rarely gets noticed as their just-get-it-done attitude discourages the time and energy required for high-quality work. The efforts you make in going above and beyond comes with the risk of being downplayed and dismissed as you struggling to complete tasks.\r\n\r\nWhen advised of the failures to meet their expectations, the opportunity you\u2019re given for improvement is an illusion. It\u2019s very hard to change their minds once they\u2019ve targeted you for dismissal. You\u2019ll do your best to demonstrate your skills and talents but it will never be enough; it doesn't matter how good or how successful, they'll always ask for more. Small mistakes are exaggerated and good work is overlooked. There is no clear feedback regarding your standing, and your direct and upfront requests for more feedback is dismissed with excuses about not having enough information to evaluate you.\r\n\r\nYou are given the choice to speak with HR, but it's downplayed and not given any real importance. Instead, you are advised to trust them because it\u2019s difficult to be aware of your shortcomings; you are advised to trust them and let them help you become a better employee, to give in to their \u201cconstructive criticism\u201d and look inward to see what can be done to improve yourself, to accept their comments and choice of words as \u201ctough love\u201d as opposed to being unfair and unreasonable.\r\n\r\nThe day you get fired will come as a surprise.

At the end of your shift you can be held on a chat or call with a customer for an undetermined amount of time, which means you cannot plan a life for after your shift is over without expecting the possibility to be late. You're told basically that it sucks to be you if you get a call late. Your options are to a) suck it up and do your job, or b) rush the client to try and get them off the phone faster. If you do that though you risk the negative feedback that will affect your scores and employment. The system is SUPPOSED to be set up to not allow you to work more than 40 hours in a week according to terms in the employment contract. However, that's obviously not the case, as if you go over each individual day you can still access the system and are required to conduct work as per your normal scheduled hours. So basically they are just not willing to ever pay you for more than 40 hours a week. Even though you may be working significantly more. But through loophole because they pay more than minimum wage they are legally allowed to require this working off the clock. Honestly, it's bs and shows a lack of care and respect for the employee. \r\n\r\n2) Squad Leads are... to put it simply, less than trained. There is a need to promote the right people within the company and that is not happening. My current SL disappears for large amounts of time during the shift and is non-responsive when I need assistance. He uses nothing but buzz words to try and motivate the team without actually giving sound advice or mentorship. \r\n\r\n3) There are perks to working for the company, but they mostly feel like they are there to distract you from the fact that other things are not there. They feel like they're meant to placate you from a bigger picture of what you're not getting. \r\n\r\n4) Advancement opportunities seem bleak. You really can only transfer from one team to another based basically on what you want to choose to specialize in. Or god forbid you become a Squad Lead. Many people want to be \"mentors\" and get the chance to do the listening in to your calls and what have you, but they are doing it in an effort to not have to work themselves. \r\n\r\n4) The mentality is very hipster. Which is trendy sure, but leaves a lot to be desired. They've grown too big too fast and are not properly managing the people they have. \r\n\r\n5) New features are rolled out awkwardly and do not allow for older merchants who have been with the company to access new features that new clients can. Which creates an unnecessary strain on you as an agent to answer why. \r\n\r\n6) Goals are given daily, weekly etc. That are hard to maintain. You can and will be penalized for not reaching and meeting these goals. The frustrating part is when you're being \"coached\" by an SL who really doesn't seem to be meeting the standards of what it takes to be an SL himself. \r\n\r\nThere are more cons, but I feel like.. honestly that's enough. I'm currently seeking other employment and would rather take a pay cut than to continue working with this company. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted. I'm good at the job.

I believe this was largely due to constantly having to be \"on\" - when you're on phones and/or chats, your every pee break is timed by the second. Every conversation is recorded and Shopify has very specific messaging that can be extremely difficult to keep up with (especially since new features are always being added/subtracted). There wasn't a day where I was able to actually leave when my shift ended - I would always spend at least an hour trying to keep up with phone calls, chats, and email. \r\n\r\nHigh Turnover - Although I was only in the role for about a month before the cons outweighed the pros for me,  I experienced a ton of inconsistent management and several people in my initial training group has resigned due to stress and anxiety-related concerns. Additionally, I heard way too many stories of people who were afraid they were going to get fired any second for taking too long of a break here, not keeping up with 3 simultaneous chats well enough, etc. In my short time there, I heard from tons of people about the high turnover rate and was really alarmed by how many people from my training group ended up leaving within the first month. \r\n\r\nFalse Promises - Throughout training, you're encouraged to think about the roles you want to move into after your time as a guru. You go to Zoom meeting after Zoom meeting where someone who got promoted from the guru role after 2 weeks is telling you all about their department. Then, once you get into the role, you quickly learn that rapid movement is something that's dying out - and it's now pretty much impossible to get out of the guru role even after 2+ years.\r\n\r\nI worked in sales and customer service for many years, but Shopify exudes a kind of pressure and exhaustion I have never before experienced. In a few short weeks, I lost control of my mental health - even as someone who's very active, healthy, and makes a concerted effort to prioritize my mental wellbeing. \r\n\r\nMy main point here - Shopify Gurus get amazing benefits, but at a steep cost.

Then they will put you in the dog house and rationalize their bad management if you even hint that something could be done better or say that something was not explained clearly.\r\n\r\n- Non-divulgence of the actual expected work load during the interviewing process: 3 ongoing chats are needed (along with phone calls and emails), which is 50% higher than the norm in the industry (Amazon has a maximum of 2 chats, for example, which can be overwhelming at times... 3 is crazy and anti-productive, especially when you consider the highly technical subject matter usually involved).

It's not reasonable to write out all the small daily problems happening daily here, but overall lately it's a total lack of consideration and respect. To anyone who's thinking 'well that's the way the world works and how companies are these days and bottom line is everything' - I get it. The problem here is that Shopify preaches otherwise and tries to paint a very different picture of how this company actually values you and your work. Shopify had the opportunity to be better than accepting the status quo for call center environments - toxic morale, high stress and high turnover, responsibilities piling as our platform integrates with more and more on the internet - and that was silly wishful thinking on my part. In the end, saving pennies will be their intention despite the role getting 3x as complex since I started. Raises are non existent or equal to/below inflation. You are constantly being told corporate lines to make us think one way and deflect us from the decisions being made that are making this job unmanageable and gurus suffer daily. I used to be such a lover of Shopify and wanted it to be my forever company but everything is going downhill here. Morale, our stock price, our employee numbers. We get announcements boasting about how much money Shopify is making and processing in GMV, and somehow when we ask about our paywe are met with judgement of being entitled and comments of 'how can we NOT be happy here' - it's the wonderful place of Shopify so if we don't like it we can reevaluate if it's the right place for us. Trying to make any negative feelings heard is only an uphill battle. First you will be told you are just making these things up and no one else but you actually feels this way and to change your attitude. Then you will talk to your squadmates and realize you are all feeling exactly this way. You will then be told you are a toxic squad that is spreading these feelings to the rest of gurus, and the intention to keep making gurus feel like they are the problem continues. Any hardship Shopify puts on their employees is expected to be managed by the employee by just doing 'more self care' or 'changing your attitude'.

This place is terrible. Middle management and supervisors are absolutely clueless with how to properly run the support team that Shopify needs. Our concerns are dismissed always and we're made to feel like we don't know anything by people that have never done our job. The only people who stick up for gurus in the rest of support are people who were recently gurus since they know what it's like. Suggest something reasonable like adding a character/ message limit for merchants starting chats so we don't get pages of text before even connecting with the merchant during our HOUR long wait times? Nope, no way, god forbid we implement something that makes the guru job even a sliver easier when we are actively voicing where we are struggling. Stop trying to compare Shopify to other companies that are nothing like us. We support the ENTIRE internet. This isn't Rogers, or Telus where you actually have departments that know about a specific aspect of the company to help someone, so you have no business trying to tell us that we're following the norm. Pretty sure Rogers went down to 2 chats at a time also after their employees voiced concerns but noooo, not Shopify, it's basically a crime to make any kind of change that positively impacts employees and helps them with an increasingly stressful job. \r\n\r\nWe're the place mat for merchants to walk all over us and if you voice that you're struggling, you're essentially told off since there's 100s of people wanting to work here (obviously oblivious to how it actually is working here). Please PLEASE read all the Glassdoor reviews before considering working here, especially for gurus. And anyone working here under a year is still probably under the impression that Shopify cares about them and they have a chance to advance. That notion will fade soon once you start seeing the patterns of how decisions are made and the lies you are fed to make you think you are working towards a larger goal. You are fed the idea that Shopify's success is your success. It is not. Shopify will use and abuse gurus to grow and once you are burnt out they are done with you. Upper management has completely lost touch with what it means to care about their employees. Last time I checked, it's normal for large companies that say they are 'progressive' to actually invest time, resources and money into their employees to try and keep them here.

Your KPI\u2019s are almost impossible to reach, no matter how hard you try. A day in the life of a Guru consists of back to back phone calls for either part of your shift (8hrs) or half of your shift, where you better not take more than 5mins to finish your notes and send out an email. This is then followed by back to back chats, which just by the way you are expected to do 3 at a time (they don\u2019t mention that in the interview process, this little nugget of information becomes known well into your training). You have an incredibly high workload, with constant interaction where all you do is try your best under the circumstances, all to be told during your QA that you are either a low performer or if you\u2019re lucky average. There will be constant and borderline over the top goal setting, which in all honestly don\u2019t lead to anything. The cherry on top the cake is that you will often get abusive merchants, and be prepared to be told that there is always something you could have done differently, even if they come in being completely rude, it feels like it will always be your fault that they are upset.

Promotions stink of nepotisim and cliques are rampant.

The place is in a desperate need of a union for employees. There is little to no long term planning, which is ridiculous for a company planning to be 100 years old. As a Guru, it is a soul crushing, empathy sucking, time demanding job and it will wear down anyone. There might be a reply to this review from management that will \"understand where these feelings are coming from\" and \"it is not for everyone\",  they \"empathise and understand\" and they \"make changes to address these kinds of issues\" but that is lip service. They are looking to cover themselves and protect the company image at the cost of Gurulands wellbeing. It is business as usual and unsurprisingly they hemorrhage talent.
