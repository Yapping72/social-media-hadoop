This was regardless of your own background, or where you are from.\r\n\r\nThere's an interesting slack channel there called \"politispot\", which became fueled by emotional rage/hate. You'll see comments in there like \"Alabama shouldn't even be a state\". \"All Trump supporters are racist\", or \"My cousin/sister/dad is a Trump supporter, I don't know how to react...\" with everyone agreeing or not objecting to them. Most of the articles that were posted were essentially click-bait headlines that just riled up everyone's emotions even more. \r\n\r\nHubspot brought the outside political environment into work. Oddly enough, most if not all of the folks there are totally fine with blanket statements calling a group of people racist, re-training for white people, and other concerning behaviors.

Leadership (CEO, CTO etc) constantly appreciate engineering as well as UX efforts and trust employees/teams to design the tools for our customers. Leadership makes an effort to highlight customers and learn from them \r\n\r\n- Amazing leadership: Leadership treats you as a human first, an employee second. Obviously they want you to get your work done, but they are empathetic (especially in these times) and build out a culture that invests in employees and gives them the support, education & programming they need to be successful \r\n\r\n- Transparent/Thoughtful crisis response: It's no secret that 2020 has been an insanely hard year for many. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, leadership has given regular updates and kept employees in the know about what is happening. That's no small feat, given we are a global organization and countries are all making different decisions. They did not shy away from tough conversations, and were transparent with us in all of their plans on how to move through this time. They are ahead of the curve in announcing what the future of work will look like post-pandemic, and giving multiple options to employees so each person can freely choose what is best for them. On top of that, with the social justice issues we are facing specifically in the US, leadership has taken a strong and necessary stance on investing in DI&B efforts (not just saying they will, but highlighting their action plan, reporting on diversity hiring etc) and standing by Black employees during these painful times. We have a new required training around racism in the US, they have made donations to the Equal Justice Initiative and more. HubSpot is actively trying to help employees be better people and make our communities better for everyone. They acknowledge that they still have more work to do. \r\n\r\nI was at a previous company for a number of years, that I had loved, but it was my first job out of college.

You will learn, and you will learn a lot. HubSpot doesn't just have a great culture, it has an advanced technology stack. The code base is very new (even at its oldest points) and we utilize a vast array of technology.  Your resume will be very impressive after being here for just a year. Your bosses are very supportive, and will make sure you are learning from every pull request, and every mistake. You're encouraged to take your time and develop your skills, I have never felt like I wasn't being supported by my team during my ramp up process. Everyone around you is very intelligent, and you're able to just absorb information and knowledge. You'll get a bunch of different opinions (HubSpot engineers are very passionate), and it'll be up to you to draw conclusions and decide what the best path forward is. You learn by doing, and you do a lot here. \n\n2. The infrastructure is state of the art. Unless you're on the dev ops/infra team (bless them), you won't have to worry about deploying/scaling/monitoring your teams' service, it just happens automagically. Your team has a mission that is well defined, and you will pretty much only be writing code that adds direct value to that mission. This allows teams to iterate very quickly, and is honestly one of my favorite things about working here.\n\n3. Autonomy. You will absolutely not be micro managed. Do you think this new technology that just came out will help the team? You have the freedom  to pursue that.  There is no set work schedule, nobody to track your hours, if you're executing and doing your work effectively, how you manage your time is up to you (meetings are generally from 11 AM - 3 PM from what I've seen).\n\n4. The relationships between product managers and software engineers is absolutely phenomenal. All product managers I've worked with are surprisingly technical, and understand that what may seems simple to the lay man, may actually not be quite so simple, and will respect our estimates and feedback. The product managers also do a great job communicating what the customer pains are, and are a great bridge between us and the customers. I always feel like the work I'm doing has a purpose, and is directly adding value to the company, and this is largely thanks to the wonderful PMs we have. \n\n5. Wide variety of roles. We have backend/front end teams. Within those teams we have dev ops, infrastructure, platform teams etc etc. You have the freedom to pursue what you're most interested in and where you take your career is really up to you.", "cons": "Experiences may vary from team to team.

I couldn't believe how excited they were about the team and company mission. I was skeptical that someone who'd been at a company for five years could still be so animated about it. After all, it's only a matter of time before cynicism creeps in at every company, right? HubSpot is different. The culture they preach is one everyone truly lives by. Not just in the good times, but also the bad. The times I've seen HubSpot's integrity on display is during times of crisis, where tough decisions had to be made with real tradeoffs. Time and again, HubSpot's leaders have always come back to the core values of being humble, empathetic, adaptable, remarkable, and transparent. HubSpot's executives think for the long term, and it shows in every decision they make.\n\nFor me, HubSpot has been a place to learn and grow more than any place I've been. I've benefited enormously from so many opportunities to shape various parts of the product as the company has grown. Because autonomy is so core to HubSpot, I've always felt I can make a difference, even as we've grown larger.\n\nI have two young kids, and HubSpot has been an ideal balance between an energizing pace of work, and the flexibility to be present with my family now - not later when they're all grown up.\n\nI'm a big believer that impact at work isn't dependent on your physical location. Thankfully that aligns with HubSpot's believes as well, which allowed me to move from Boston to Orlando, FL, to be closer to family while continuing to grow my career. I'm grateful to HubSpot's commitment to remote work, not as just an option, but as a way of life that HubSpot fully embraces. That commitment benefits me personally, but is also good for diversity, inclusion, and internal mobility.\n\nAfter two years of beginning a remote manager, managing up to 10 people with a mix of folks in the US headquarters, our Dublin office, and remote locations, I can say I've been able to have just as much of an impact as I would have in the Cambridge office. The company has invested heavily in the technology to make global work a smooth experience. Recently, they've also doubled down on the culture of remote work to make sure its the norm, not an afterthought that privileges hallway conversations at HQ.  Our approach has been thoughtful - accomodating a range of needs folks have and avoiding a dogmatic position on either extreme of office-only or remote-only policies.\n\nAs a UXer at HubSpot, you'll meet folks with a range of incredible talents, all with a humble attitude. Everyone wants to do their best work, solve real problems for customers, and enjoy working with each other while they do it.\n\nBeing at HubSpot is the best thing that's happened in my career and has been a huge benefit to my family. I'm grateful for the experience and see a lot of promise still ahead. HubSpot is just getting started with a strong strategy and thoughtful leadership at the helm. It's the people that make it so special, so you should come along for the ride.", "cons": "At our size, we're a little behind on scaling our systems and operations. This creates friction and can take away time from focusing on customers and product strategy. That said, I see signs we'll continue to invest here and we'll catch up as the company matures.\n\nOur DNA of small-autonomous teams has kept us nimble. The tradeoff is a structure that makes the execution of a smooth, cross-platform UX a challenge.\n\nWe have a ways to go on hiring a more diverse team and retaining those we hire. However, I'm continually impressed by the long term thinking and deep commitment of everyone in the company to make systemic changes that will last over the long haul.

At any other company, this would have seriously affected my day-to-day working life. It may even have meant I couldn't continue working. But at HubSpot, where adaptability is deeply ingrained into the company culture (which includes flexibility and remote working), my working life has continued without any glitches or stress. In fact, I would go so far as to say the accommodations HubSpot made for me reduced any stress levels. I was allowed reduce my hours to work a 4-day week. I was allowed work from home as much I wanted (which importantly, never impacted how I work or my connection to my colleagues). The nature of the work I was given was adapted to suit my circumstances. I don't have to ask for permission to attend medical appointments and I'm never made feel like I'm asking for special treatment. I'm simply trusted to do my job, which I'm still very capable of doing, just not necessarily at an office desk, between the hours of 9 and 5. I'm also still very much challenged every day with new responsibilities and tasks, which is very important to me because I don't ever want to stop learning. It's important to mention that even before my health deteriorated, I had the same flexibility to manage my home life and parenting, when it comes to things like children's doctors appointments for example. \r\nAs well as those practical things, one important thing to mention is that I felt comfortable opening up about my circumstances and being 'my authentic self' at HubSpot, something I could never do at other companies. I know many people who work in chronic pain or with some other personal weight on their shoulders and don't feel able to talk to their employer about it for fear of how it might affect their career. At HubSpot, while I can't speak for every employee, my experience has been that HubSpot wants to help employees to their jobs however they can and colleagues are empathetic and understanding. \r\n\r\nAside from my personal circumstances, I've been very impressed with how HubSpot has dealt with the Covid crisis, always putting employees, customers and partners before profit. They acted quickly and the support and resources they provided while we all worked from home while parenting was fantastic. Don't get me wrong, they were still tough months for everyone, but it really felt like we were all in it together, helping each other get through each day. And leadership were incredibly transparent at every stage so we knew where we stood from day 1, with regular updates as offices closed etc. I'm not sure they could have handled it any better.\r\n\r\nAs an ally, I'm so proud to work for a company that walks the walk when it comes to social issues. There's always work to be done of course, but it feels like there's a genuine passion to do the right thing and a thoughtful process involved to identify real and impactful actions that we can take as a company to be better allies and support minority communities, both within and outside of HubSpot. Leadership are also very transparent when it comes to the efforts Again, full transparency, I'm speaking as an ally here, not a member of a minority group.\r\n\r\nSo all of that, along with the incredibly smart colleagues I work with every day, the top-notch perks and the fast-pace (which I love), I highly recommend working here.", "cons": "Over 3 years in and I still can't think of any.

The people are all friendly and there's a genuine camaraderie within departments. \r\n\r\nThe benefits were up to par with a scaling mid-sized tech company and the location was accessible. \r\n\r\nI really believed in the vision of the leadership team, and the north star of the company influenced each business unit, resulting in a strong combined effort!", "cons": "The customer support rep job is an entry level job and the only clear pathways available are into customer success and backline support via the product expert role. People successfully transition to other roles, but compared to success and backline support, other transitions are much less direct and have a lower probability, meaning you might be forced to stay in customer support for much longer than you desire. Timing is a huge limiting factor with regards to non-traditional internal transfers -- you might be waiting for the perfect opportunity that you ultimately get passed over on. More on this below, but this is a greater risk because support reps are not paid well. \r\n\r\nDepending on your background, customer support can be a fantastic entry point into a strong company. But for some, the choice will be between taking a support role for 40k instead of a position that pays a non-negligible amount more at a non-tech company. I believed that I would be able to ascend quickly based on working harder than other support reps, but the internal structures do not incentive outperformers, they reward time in seat. Despite being able to complete cases with rapidity while maintaining a high NPS score, I was not able to take on stretch projects due to my manager tracking \"availability\". While the operation justification for tracking availability made some sense, practically it meant that I was not allowed to work towards my next desired role during my work day despite exceeding the core KPIs of case count and NPS. This is not how a salaried role should be structured. Becoming more efficient at your current role is how you stretch into the next role at any other company. My development was throttled due to this dynamic.\r\n\r\nFinally, you'll be paid below national market rates at every step of the way at Hubspot. For some people the pros mentioned above are worth being underpaid and experiencing stagnation, but I didn't believe it was a prudent early career decision -- although it might be a valid choice at a more senior position within the company."}, {"review_title": "Grow with HubSpot", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "22 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Senior Engineering Manager in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is an incredible feeling to work for a company with a true growth mindset. There will always be growth opportunities for the company and its engineering organization, but the company has great leadership, especially in people ops, to ensure we smartly grow from those opportunities. Even the company culture code has changed in my time at HubSpot to put greater weight on empathy.\r\n\r\nThe product/engineering values, like the culture code, are powerful and accurately reflect the technical culture and how to be successful within it. There are high expectations for the performance and growth of engineers. The result of those high expectations is a group of very smart people working together to solve hard customer problems with a large amount of autonomy. There is autonomy at the team level to decide what customer problems to solve and at the individual level for how to best solve for the problems. Everyone has a lot of flexibility over when and where they do their best work or to take a break using the unlimited vacation.\r\n\r\nThe company seamlessly made the transition to full-time remote during the quarantine. They provide resources and requested lots of feedback to ensure that management and onboarding can be as successful in this new environment. Once the pandemic ends, I am thankful for the ability to choose to work full-time remote or be \"flexible\" and only go in a few times a week without any pressure on which option to choose, and instead be able to make the decision that works best for myself and my family.", "cons": "The technical culture will not be a great fit for everyone. There is intentionally no dedicated QA or ops teams. That requires engineers to take full ownership of their code and have a solid understanding of our customers. Writing code can be the easiest part of the development lifecycle for customer-focused engineering teams. Because of the company's size, fewer problems can be solved by engineers in isolation. It is hard to be successful with poor communication skills.

I took the role and have never (ever) been happier. It's truly a very special place. During the \"interview process\" (which felt more like meeting new, really interesting and smart friends), outsiders commented that 'people make HubSpot great.' With two years under my belt, I'd say that's very true. Don't get me wrong, the tech is amazing too. But, HubSpot's magic is in the culture and community that the founders, leadership team, and every HubSpotter has created. It's an extremely supportive environment and there's an ever-present focus on learning and growing. While past roles have helped me develop my technical and/or functional expertise, my time at HubSpot has taught me about *real* people leadership -- not just in a textbook sense, but in a real world, practical sense. Putting people first, truly VALUING diversity and the unique backgrounds and perspectives that each HubSpotter brings to work every day, leading with HEART.... these are invaluable lessons not just about work, but about people, about life. I'm extremely grateful every day for the opportunity to work with such an amazing team, amazing customers, and an amazing network of partners.

If you are none of those things - good luck to you and your sanity.\r\n\r\n- Still tries to act like a start up when there are now well over 1000 people.  The lack of structure worked once, but now it feels very messy and too loose.  A lot needs to be tightened up (in a way that doesn't lose the casual atmosphere altogether).\r\n\r\n- Unqualified and inept management.  It appears that once you have been at HubSpot for x many years you get promoted to management, no matter if you were a developer or a support 'engineer', which is an absolute nightmare for real professionals to work under.\r\n\r\n- Unmet expectations.  They do a great job marketing themselves to potential hires, saying how they are truly changing the world, how there is infinite opportunity in the company, how they are the best of the best, that it is harder to get into HubSpot than Yale, that culture and transparency is the #1 priority.

Again, if you are a frat house type extroverted person, you will love it.  if not (especially introverted developers) you will feel left out.  \r\n\r\n- Hidden HR Department.  HR is deftly called \"People Ops\", and people are left in the dark about the support they can offer to employees.

The expectation was you\u2019d always have your laptop \u201cin case anything came up.\u201d If someone left their desk before 6pm, you\u2019d often hear them say something like \u201cI have to go to an appointment but I\u2019ll be back online by 8.\u201d Oftentimes managers would communicate this as well- reinforcing the idea that you needed to be \u201conline\u201d 24/7. \r\n\r\nAge\r\nMuch has been said about HubSpot\u2019s lack of diversity. I do believe there\u2019s a good-faith effort to improve this, and I respect the standards they\u2019re trying to set in the industry in this matter.  But what they seem unwilling to address is the lack of age diversity. Among all the people I collaborated with at HubSpot, I\u2019m struggling to think of even one person who was over the age of 35. There are a lot of problems with this, obviously, but one thing that stuck with me was the \u201cinmates running the asylum\u201d vibe. Over and over again, major problems were left to a bunch of 25 years old employees to solve. While we (I was one of those 25 year olds) struggled to find solutions, these \u201ccrises\u201d could have been solved easily through the lens of experience. Reflecting back, I often think about how every day felt like a fire drill at HubSpot, and I think much of that is because we all had no frame of reference. It was nearly everyone\u2019s first or second job, and we all could have really benefited from someone working with us that had longevity in the industry, or longevity even in an office setting. \r\n\r\nEgo \r\nNow here\u2019s something with a harder solve. HubSpot has an ego problem. Employees are told over and over that they\u2019re the best, the most intelligent, etc etc. and that ethos is internalized by many. There\u2019s a \u201cwin at all costs\u201d mentality that causes high tension between employees, and fosters and extremely competitive environment internally. There\u2019s a \u201cwatch your back\u201d culture- your teammates WILL undercut you to get ahead. Leaders who\u2019ve had complaints leveled against them time and time again continue to get promoted or shuffled around departments. If you provide results (hit your goals, etc) you\u2019ll be held up as a \u201cgolden boy\u201d and protected."}, {"review_title": "Best place I've ever worked", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Technical Lead in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* The people here truly walk the walk in terms of culture.

Hubspot has values. At my first company meeting, I discovered Hubspot hired Ta-Nehisi Coates to speak at their yearly conference. If you don't know Ta-Nehisi Coates, he writes about being a Black man and a Black father in the United States. You can't have a speaker like Ta-Nehisi Coates and feign indifference. Being someone who also cares about Black people and issues of racism, I was so grateful I started crying at the company meeting. Hubspot was willing to ruffle feathers and lose business to stand behind someone they believe in. It was refreshingly honorable.\r\n\r\n2. Hubspot hires people who are both sharp and kind. At almost every job I've had, someone has always made me feel small or uncomfortable. At Art.com, a woman would completely ignore me whenever I'd try and communicate. I'd try to talk to her in the hallway and she'd act like I'm invisible. It made me feel horrible and it made me incredibly inefficient at my job. At Hubspot, I've never met someone I haven't liked. Consequently, I'm a happy person, I collaborate easily with new people, and I'm efficient in getting work done.\r\n\r\n3. Hubspot is a big company with a small company feel. Big companies get overly political and bureaucratic. Culture is often lost and you quickly become a bee in a hive-slogging through process after process to get your job done or to accomplish any HR task. You feel like your voice is lost. Hubspot has maintained an incredibly friendly, free atmosphere as a 1500 person company. There is a shared culture of getting things done, putting ones ego aside, and asking questions. Everyone is responsive and accessible from the Head of Culture to the VP of Product. You're empowered to do what's best for your team and to lead your own charge in your own way.\r\n\r\n4. Hubspot has great design managers. It's common to promote the loudest, most extroverted, outspoken people. Hubspot is different in that they promote a variety of personalities into management positions. My boss is a soft spoken, incredibly empathetic person. His boss (the head of our department) is a super creative, nurturing type who's always looking ahead and reexamining the way we work to ensure we get what we need. My therapist says I've never been this happy. She says all this time, I've just been looking for a good manager.\r\n\r\nSo what about that Disrupt article that guy wrote-the one that talks about how Hubspot is a frat house filled with 20-year-olds? Here is what I can say:\r\n\r\n- I had read the article and I was skeptical about the seemingly very young people who interviewed me.\r\n- They won me over in minutes with their smarts and lack of ego (to me, this has nothing to do with age).\r\n- I've never experienced any of that fratty behavior in Product.", "cons": "I moved to Cambridge from Oakland, California.

For commuters, cooking at home is not an option, especially if your dept requires you to work late shifts. Nobody has time to cook. You either snack your meals with free snacks in the office or spend a lot of money buying food. There are a lot of employees in the office who snack their meals with chips and cereals from the office. They are brining in smoothie baristas next year, but I bet there are going to be a lot of people drinking smoothie to substitute their breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I did not sign up for any health benefits because I cannot deduct any more pay from my salary for that.

At HubSpot I feel like I've finally found what I've been looking for (take that, U2). I know that sounds like a big statement but everything I've seen in engineering aligns so perfectly with the values I've practiced and preached, from the top of the stack to the bottom. I don't want to bore you to death with an essay, but here are some of the things that really stand out:\r\n\r\n* The technical talent on the team is amazing. I've worked with brilliant engineers in the past, but the consistent level of intelligence, capability, and competence here is impressive.\r\n\r\n* The passion the entire team gives and the pride they take in what we're doing is such a motivator and inspiration. I've read the same stuff you have about the 'cult'; it couldn't be farther from the truth. This is hard working people taking pride in what they've accomplished.\r\n\r\n* The lack of bureaucracy and process is so refreshing. It's focused on Just Effing Doing It instead of endlessly debating and needing sign-off from eighty nine different levels. This can definitely take some getting used to because leadership is largely just sketching a very rough outline and everyone else is not only filling it in, but erasing the lines and redrawing as they see fit. It can sometimes feel like we're veering around a bit, but leadership does a fantastic job of catching that just as it's beginning to show signs of a problem and correcting it.\r\n\r\n* I didn't realize how much the politicking at my old company was affecting me until I came to a place where... well... it doesn't happen. There's a real lack of kingdom building or ladder climbing - and instead it's very much a bottoms-up mentality with a focus on what you've done and not how well you play the game.\r\n\r\n* Competence and excellence are recognized and rewarded. It's not about who you know or what group you're in; if you do awesome stuff it's seen and celebrated. I was so tired of needing to brown nose to get ahead. Here I've told my boss to his face he was wrong, or that I disagreed with our leadership, or that I was going to do something and didn't care what he thought, and rather than being smacked down I was thanked for pushing for what I knew was right.\r\n\r\n* The culture here is Absolutely. Fantastic. There's an commitment to employee satisfaction that they really do take seriously. There are regular satisfaction surveys, we have people dedicated to making it an enjoyable place to work, the company's very willing to spend money on things that could be considered frivolous - like team lunches, or trivia nights - and any tool you need to do your job better is essentially yours. I'm not naive enough to think that this is all altruism, but it definitely feels like the company cares about us as people. And what's more, that belief and focus is practiced and felt at all levels, by everyone here.\r\n\r\nI know that all this sounds too good to be true or like I'm a soulless shill, but I couldn't be happier with my decision to move here. If you're looking for a place that dispenses with the crap, does awesome things, hires amazing talent, and treats its employees with respect and kindness you could do a hell of a lot worse than HubSpot. I'm looking forward to many more years here.", "cons": "This isn't a place that caters to passivity.

There's plenty of help if you ask, but if you're expecting someone to give your formal requirements, document the steps you should follow, or shepherd you through your day-to-day you're going to be sorely disappointed. We want passionate, driven, opinionated people who aren't going to sit back and let someone else make all the decisions.\r\n\r\nOur lack of structure and process is almost a negative, and I'll be the first to admit we probably need a little bit more. We're growing rapidly but we don't do an amazing job of defining defaults that lead people to the right solutions, which means every new tech lead or engineer has to figure a lot out for themselves.

This is a standard mid-sized tech company that's performing well. You'll get excellent medical , dental, & vision, excellent stock options, above-average base salary, a beautiful office, unlimited PTO, and more.\r\n\r\nThe company has done an excellent job of becoming a best place to work for women, and this shows, from the high number of women in top management positions. The company hasn't achieved this by taking a radical feminist stance of trying to encourage women to be more like men and then driving them away in the process, but rather, by valuing women for who they are and creating special benefits that women will enjoy. On site you'll find manicures and pedicures available, and the company offers flexible hours and other benefits so that women with children won't feel they have to choose between their children and their careers.\r\n\r\nThe managers have created a positive environment by genuinely listening to their employees (en masse).

However, this comes with a caveat that if the job doesn't work out, it can also hurt your prospects because many employers assume that if it didn't work out for you at HubSpot, you must not be a good developer. This is especially concerning given the above-average chance of it not working out for you, which is something I will cover in the cons.", "cons": "The company has done an excellent job of creating a positive environment for women, but this can lead to double standards. In the office, women make sex jokes of the same nature that you'd expect most women only to make in private with their female friends. It's generally understood that if a male employee were to make similar jokes, he'd be fired.\r\n\r\nMost tech companies err on the side of not hiring an employee they're on the fence about, in the belief that it's more detrimental to the company to make a bad hire, than it is beneficial to make a good one. HubSpot wants to ensure it doesn't miss out on a rockstar developer. The way it reconciles these two competing interests is by hiring anyone the company could go either way on, but also firing them if, for any reason, it isn't working out after 3-6 months. What this means is it's possible to be hired by the company, placed in a situation in which it's impossible for you to succeed through no fault of your own, and fired three months later. In my case, I was placed on a team in which the tech lead was out recovering from surgery and the person who was supposed to be helping me was unavailable. After six months I was fired without the company ever trying me on a different team.\r\n\r\nWhat Dan Lyons wrote about the company only caring about the bottom line is very true. The managers do listen, but only to large numbers. As an individual, you matter very little. I worked 10 hour days and on weekends to compensate for the absence of management I was given. I suggested pairing me to work with someone from another team for just a few days and it was ignored. People knew I was struggling, but not a single one ever offered to help me. The only management I was given was being told that anonymous members of my team had assumed I wasn't doing work, and because the team is more important than the individual, it was my job to figure out how to get them to stop. When I was fired, I saw a very different side of one of my managers. This was someone who was largely respected in the company and regarded as a sensitive, helpful manager. I was told I didn't have common sense and that I didn't belong in the field. I've since gone on to lead projects at major companies and be courted by some of the biggest names in tech, but once the company decides it doesn't need you, you see its real side. \r\n\r\nThe company's approach to management is very passive aggressive. They might hold a meeting telling everyone they don't want them to feel they have to work too long, but privately you'll be told you're underperforming and you need to get your productivity up.\r\n\r\nEven though the company does take steps to create a feeling that you're around friends, the truth is many of the people will show a different side of themselves once you're no longer with the company. Only one person from the company has kept in touch.\r\n\r\nThe reputation about being the best place to work in Boston is largely hype that the company has created. During the years I've worked in Boston, the only people I've met who wanted to work for HubSpot were college students who bought into the hype. By contrast, I know several seasoned developers who know about this company's reputation and don't want to work here. Everyone in Boston knows someone who knows someone who got overworked by the company and either was fired, or quit.\r\n\r\nOnce you leave the company you'll meet multiple people who tell you they felt the same way as Dan Lyons but were less vocal about it, etc."}, {"review_title": "Great place for flexibility, learning and being a part of something BIG", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You are constantly challenged here.

All of my expectations have either been met or exceeded. I work with extremely talented, intelligent, and motivated people that individually produce more than entire teams at other companies that I have interacted with. Beyond that, I have not yet encountered an instance of ego or political domination. The company is very open minded and receptive to criticism and innovation. Considering how large HubSpot is, it's also a very flat organization. For example, I sit just a couple desks away from Brian Halligan (CEO). He uses the same desk furniture as everyone else and because he sits out in the open, he and all of the execs at HubSpot are extremely accessible. I have an immediate team of 3 people and I correspond with 8-10 people on a daily basis. This allows me to have true autonomy and influence over my work. We are building a legitimately world-class product and it feels awesome to be a part of that. The energy at HubSpot is extremely positive; the company is doing well and you can feel it. On my first day, I was immediately given all of the tools that I needed to complete my work (regardless of cost). HubSpot believes in enabling you to do what you do best by giving you access to everything that you need. All of the culture-related promises are true. There are no designated work hours (at least for my role), unlimited vacation, the office is incredible, free food is everywhere (and beer / wine), there are dozens of events every week that the company pays for, you name it. Working at HubSpot is challenging in the best ways possible. I have never grown so much, so quickly in my life. I go home happy every day and I wake up ready to get after it again.", "cons": "HubSpot maintains a very fast-paced, results-oriented (read: \"work hard, play hard\") environment. They're very diligent about recognizing high performers and the criteria surrounding recognition is totally pure (it isn't political). This is great when you're the one being recognized, but it also places a lot of social pressure on the people in the audience, thus creating a subculture of competition where you may always be chasing after that next \"quick win\". A byproduct of this is a high level of self-motivation and team-driven motivation. While I personally have noticed my work-life balance improve, I do feel that some people may work too much, and it may be a result of this aspect of the environment. If you generally don't like your job or you don't enjoy \"taking your work home with you\", you probably won't fit in. For example, many HubSpotters are friends or roommates with each other outside of work. Beyond that, if you don't produce legitimate results or you don't know what you're talking about, people will call you on it.

Other companies don\u2019t do that. Other companies hoard, and filter, and release bitesize chunks of \u201cdigestible\u201d information to their frontlines. But HubSpot's commitment to transparency means that every employee deeply understands how the company works, why the strategy is what it is, and why our execs make the decisions they do. It also empowers every employee to knowledgeably identify opportunities to improve the company \u2014 our founders openly share their thought processes (and their concerns and their blindspots) because they want everyone at HubSpot to have a founder\u2019s mindset. You\u2019ll learn more about business, leadership and decision-making in 1 year at HubSpot than you could at any business school.\r\n\r\n*Dynamism*\r\nOur leadership team refuses to fall into complacency. Good is not good enough. Even if we\u2019re beating the industry average on some measure, if they know we can do better, they will push us to do better. They\u2019re not afraid to break what works in order to find something better. Other companies would be happy to make small tweaks to earn incremental progress. At HubSpot, you\u2019ll learn best practices, but you\u2019ll also learn to constantly challenge the status quo, whether that\u2019s around sales tactics, go-to-market strategy, product innovation, or customer service. \r\n\r\n*Professional Growth*\r\nMany entry-level employees will start with concrete tasks and a clear plan, but as you grow, you will increasingly have to define your own roadmap. You will be expected to experiment (and fail), you will be expected to digest as much knowledge as possible (through coffee chats and devouring the internal company wiki), and you will be expected to take advantage of unlimited free books and thousands of dollars available to support classes/training. Other companies puts people in boxes and make them climb a pre-defined ladder; HubSpot takes a build-your-own-adventure (with some guardrails) approach to professional growth. \r\n\r\n*Autonomy*\r\nUse good judgement. Take as much vacation as you need. Work from wherever you are. And get sh*t done. The results you produce matter more than whether you\u2019ve followed every instruction in some hundred-page employee handbook (see: other companies). Some people prefer structure, rigid expectations, clear lines of authority, etc. \u2014 there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but that\u2019s not HubSpot.

Given how much information and data is made available, it\u2019s sometimes hard to know what I should know and care about. At best, this can simply be a time suck; at worst, it can be overwhelming.\r\n\r\n*Manager Growing Pains*\r\nAs the company as grown rapidly, we\u2019ve promoted a number of first-time managers. Young staff look up and say, \u201cHey. I could be at least as good as that manager!\u201d Which leads to frustration, more inexperienced managers, and misaligned expectations about what professional growth should look like at its best.

But for me, the real perk at HubSpot is the flexibility to work when and where I need to (within reason) to get the job done. And the fact that I'm trusted to do my job. There's no micromanagement and you end up wanting to work better as a result.\r\n\r\nWhen I was pregnant, and as a parent now, this flexibility is everything to me. Being able to pop out for appointments or work from home when my baby is sick without any stress or hassle is worth more than any amount of free food. They allow you to be your 'authentic self' at work which you probably won't think it a big deal for you, until it's a big deal for you! In my personal experience, HubSpot really cares about their employees. So whether you're pregnant, you're unwell, a family member is unwell or there's something else going on in your life, in my case, HubSpot allows you to do your job around that life event (again, within reason). It sounds too good to be true but it's really a win win. They invest a lot in our training and onboarding when we join so why wouldn't they want to help us continue to work to the best of our abilities. Their systems are also set up to allow us to dial into video chats and access documents from anywhere.  As long as you're working hard and getting the job done, that's what matters. It's a great way of managing employees in my opinion. I used to think work/life balance meant getting out the door on time (which never happened in any other company I worked at) but now I know it means being able to fit work in around my life. \r\n\r\nHubSpotters are generally also amazing at helping each other out. The culture is really set up to make people work together. We're encouraged to thank and recognise colleagues who help us out. I've never been thanked more for just doing my job as I am here. And while that might seem like a corny pro, it actually really makes a big difference to your day.\r\n\r\nThe company also check in with us quarterly to see what issues are concerning us; what they might need to change. The month I started, there had been a big change in how we sell our services which meant people were going through a phase of working late to figure it all out. It became clear in the survey so HubSpot acted on it. Not only did they continue hiring to meet the needs of the company, they also brought in outside support to help us 'unplug' and manage work/life balance. \r\n\r\nFinally, they genuinely do their best to live by the Culture Code. When I read it (at interview stage) I was skeptical. Seemed too good to be true. So I tested it. I asked a bunch of Qs about maternity leave/pay; what the company is doing to help women thrive in tech etc. I was convinced these would go against me but instead, they were seen as positives - meant I was a good culture fit because I cared about the stuff the company cares about. I also love working at a Customer First company.

HubSpot puts immense weight during the interview process to hire people that are smart, driven, and most importantly kind. I've made some great relationships during the time I've been here, and it makes work that much more enjoyable. Everyone here is motivated to succeed and advance their careers, and it fosters an exciting environment.\r\n\r\n2. Company values. HubSpot is a company looking to be profitable like all others, but it strives to do so in partnership with its customers. You've most likely heard all about the inbound methodology, but HubSpot truly does strive to do business holistically and in a way that makes the world a better place. This not only applies to the way HubSpot goes about business, but also the way it treats its employees. You work hard, but I've never worked somewhere that invests so much in individual growth as well as transparency.\r\n\r\n3. Benefits and perks. Benefits are great compared to where I've worked in the past. The coffee is fantastic, snacks are good, and beer on tap is great. \r\n\r\n4. Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. HubSpot puts soooo much into becoming a diverse and inclusive company, and strives to foster an environment of belonging. It admits that it's got some more work to do in this department, but it's truly steadfast in eventually becoming a leader in this category. \r\n\r\nI can go on and on about my experience at HubSpot.

If you want to coast in an easy 9-5 then HubSpot is not for you. If you are coming from another industry, then prepare to put in even more hours learning the ropes and becoming familiar with tech, marketing, sales, and general business acumen. You can quickly become overwhelmed (especially in the beginning). Every employee is here to grow and make a name for themselves, so if you don't give it 100%, you will be left in the dust. \r\n\r\nThis isn't to say that the work-life balance is bad (it isn't).

It's inbound marketing software, not an emergency room.\r\n-No structure. If you like to do your own thing and are very entrepreneurial, you may enjoy this. Policies and company direction can change day to day and you may be working in marketing one day, in product the next.\r\n-No HR department.

One of the most impressive things is that the management relationship is not the kind that makes you feel watched or judged, but managers seem to go out of their way, whether or not sacrifices are necessary, to make sure that you feel comfortable, are not stressed, and most importantly are growing in your role and toward your next promotion.\r\n\r\nTech-wise, I have been extremely impressed with the platform tooling at HubSpot.

In some areas there are archeological layers of legacy stuff that has to be understood and worked with, but could and probably should be much simpler. Also associated with the level of growth is a possible lag in onboarding. Currently there is a quick burst of onboarding on some basic tools like Maven and our deployment platform. But after that you're kind of on your own to acquaint yourself with the intricate and often unintuitive product-specific systems that you need to work with. Under the banner of autonomy, engineers are expected to drive the rest of the process by asking questions and giving feedback on how they're doing. For various reasons I think that kind of guidance should be more structured and should mostly come from others, not be solicited by the new hire.  Another recent hire and I were talking about this recently and a choice line was \"it's hard when the onus is on you to connect,\r\nand you're new so you don't necessarily know what to say, but you have a nagging sense that you need some guidance.\""}, {"review_title": "HubSpot Sales", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Inbound Marketing Specialist in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work life balance and strong management at the top.

I can't speak to the overall strategy, but for the most part, as both an internal and external user, there's been continuous improvement in functionality, and the UI and general ease of use is considerably better than garbage like Marketo and Pardot\r\n\r\n- There are enough people at this point that you'll definitely find like-minded colleagues. People are generally smart and capable (though there's definitely a Dunning-Kruger effect and HubSpot's internal insistence on its meaningless stat that they're harder to \"get into\" than Harvard certainly doesn't help things), and I've connected with some truly incredible friends and colleagues here", "cons": "Two main cons, neither an easy fix:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The \"Peter principle\". Upward trajectory at HubSpot relies heavily on an eventual promotion to middle management. This is seen as \"prestigious\" or a sign of talent, but the fact of the matter is that across departments, the responsibilities of managers are vastly different from those of individual contributors. Although not universally true, wayyyy too many people get promoted to a management position based on their excellence in their current role, with little regard for whether those skills will translate to middle management (hint: they often do not). HubSpot's only alternative to rewarding excellence besides the management track is pay raises and more senior titles. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis isn't all that different from how many other companies operate, but it doesn't absolve HubSpot of its poor managerial culture. As the saying goes, \"People don't leave their jobs, they leave their managers\", and far too many strong contributors are put into managerial roles where they're at best ineffectual and at worst, an active hindrance to employee performance. There's a strong sense that managers view their status at the company as an elevated one, where it should be the reverse: middle managers are there to enable their employees to give their best performance, not to flex their tenure. Ironically, because of this culture, I've seen the converse scenario as well: middle managers stuck in middle management because it's the \"mature\" thing to do, despite being talented and smart enough to be a better fit as senior members of their team.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Diversity and inclusion. There's been a strong push at HubSpot lately to be better about diversity and inclusion, which is great to see. The problem is that most of the top-down directives are coming from a place where the top is neither very diverse nor inclusive. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a year ago and a half ago, I personally saw a new POC hire go through the new hire training, and then be let go almost immediately. Apparently, his manager didn't feel that his output was very HubSpotty. I bring this story up because I think it highlights how much work HubSpot still has to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's countless research out there highlighting that no matter how much raw intelligence or talent someone from a low-income or low-privileged background possesses, there's going to be a (usually pretty rough) transition period when they move into a more demanding environment. It's not laziness or lack of fit - it's the natural outcome of trying to adapt to completely new environments, environments which are often very familiar to those who were privileged enough to get tutoring, go to schools with AP classes, attend top tier colleges, etc. I'm not suggesting that it's HubSpot's responsibility to fix systemic inequality. I am suggesting that the company should be more patient with those they hire from, to put it bluntly, less \"Martha's Vineyard\" backgrounds. The fact that you would hire someone, put them through a month-long training (in which they've presumably turned down any and all other offers of employment), and then fire them right afterward is... not great. I chalk this one up to the individual manager's inability to empathize or just a general lack of D-I training and awareness, but it's a particularly insidious component to the systemic exclusion at the heart of tech that I don't think is talked about enough."}, {"review_title": "Great Place to Grow and Have Autonomy", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Dec 2015", "job_title": "Senior Account Executive in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "HubSpot is a great place to kick off your career and develop skills in the tech world. There are a lot of different departments that can appeal to anyone coming out of college or experiencing a change in their career or wanting to take their skills to the next level. I've learned more at HubSpot over the past few years than I've learned at any part of my life. They TRULY invest in training and that's huge. Most companies miss this, HubSpot does not.

As you go through highs and sometimes you'll feel like you messed up (but you really didn't) if you do continue to prove yourself, you do have the ability to advance in your role, you will move up, or even if qualified, possibly join another department.

The training is thorough and the experience you get working with customers is EXTREMELY valuable - you can completely start your software career from zero here, and the skills are transferrable if you decide you'd like to work at another company. Once you get out of Support, or if you start at a higher position, there's a strong feeling of belonging to a community and being truly respected and appreciated by your colleagues for people who do good work. The benefits are unbelievable so you'll definitely feel comfortable and taken care of. It seems like you also have some pretty extreme job security because the company basically refuses to fire anyone unless they're a colossal failure, but I'm not sure if I would 100% consider that a \"pro.\" \r\n\r\nI have a lot of negative thoughts I'm going to share below but I don't want it to come across the wrong way - the pros GREATLY outweigh the cons at HubSpot. There are only a handful of positions here where you'll feel under-appreciated and underpaid. If you're smart and responsible, you'll move up quickly and you'll have fun doing it. The culture is fast-paced and challenging in an exciting way, Brian and Dharmesh are absolute wonders to be associated with, and you'll have plenty of opportunities to grow and succeed. The benefits are excellent and will make even the less-desirable positions comfortable. Take advantage of the unlimited time off, free healthy food in the kitchen, crazy good health care, and generous sabbatical!", "cons": "If you're starting in Support, as many people at HubSpot do, GET OUT AS SOON AS YOU CAN. The work is grueling, hours are long, expectations are ridiculously high, and you'll be abused pretty regularly by customers (although this has gotten a lot better since they've put restrictions on who can call into the support phone line). The success of the company is so heavily reliant on support (a lot of customers list support at the top of their reasons for choosing HubSpot over competitors) but no one cares about you at all except for your direct manager (DIRECT support management is amazing, to be fair). Sales and account managers will throw you under the bus or bully you into spending your whole day on difficult side projects for their customers so they don't have to do their jobs. \r\n\r\nThe pay is super low even for an entry level tech support position, and the majority of jobs that are readily available to you after a year or 2 in support come with insultingly measly pay raises. View these positions as stepping stones. You're not getting everything you can out of the company until you're 2-3 steps away from Support. That being said, don't give Support too much of yourself while you're there. You'll get ahead by doing your job well and networking and that's it - don't waste your time on side projects and overtime because it will not benefit you, and the second you show that you're willing to put in extra work, upper management will bleed you dry. Keep your head down and trudge forward if you want to succeed here, and be wary of your low-effort colleagues. For some reason HubSpot refuses to reprimand kids in Support who do *under* the bare minimum and continuously make HUGE mistakes. These people will make your job so much harder because they're looking for every excuse to put their work on your plate so they can go enjoy the free beer. Don't befriend these people, and when their lack of effort starts to effect you, just go right to their manager and move on. They're not worth your time.\r\n\r\nNow that I'm out of Support I enjoy my job SO MUCH MORE. In fact, this is my favorite job I've ever had, despite the fact that I'm still not getting paid a competitive rate. I'll take the lower pay for a job I truly enjoy and the feeling of genuine respect in the workplace though. \r\n\r\nThe last thing I'll say about HubSpot is that you should be wary of the work culture. Especially when you're in Support, they'll try to distract you with constant social events and parties. It honestly feels like a frat house at times and there seems to be this constant pressure to drink and party, especially when you first start. Like with any other job, just be careful. Go to the social events that seem fun to you or that will actually help you network. If you're going to drink, do so lightly and skip the afterparties. If you're in Support, I would honestly recommend not going to any parties if you can avoid it. Finish your work and go home because otherwise the office will become home and it gets unhealthy really quickly. Since it's so common for people to start drinking at the office, the line of when work ends and time off begins gets blurred and things can get ugly. People have no boundaries and are constantly embarrassing themselves by talking about private/personal things that should NEVER be discussed in the office. Don't be one of them. Trust me, I've made that mistake a few times during my early days at HubSpot and I'm still humiliated."}, {"review_title": "Come as you are", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Sept 2019", "job_title": "Human Resources Business Partner", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Leadership and Management really care about  people\r\nThere is a true commitment to DI&B\r\nNo matter the level, everyone is humble, team player and hardworking \r\nThere is no lack of transparency or feedback\r\nWith the fast growth and emphasis on 'growing better', very day is a school day  and you will never be bored", "cons": "FOMO can be real - with fast growth everything moves super fast and, if not careful, you can find yourself being always on"}, {"review_title": "The most Caring, Flexible and Supportive Company I Have Ever Worked For", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Senior HelpDesk Technician in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "HubSpot is hands down the best company I have ever worked for.

I work at the latter. Halloween party at in the afternoon at daycare? I'm there. Child sick? Work from home. Vacation? I take it. Really. There are no weird looks. There is only acceptance and support from my team and colleagues. I can't say how much that makes me want to work harder and give my all.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me to the work. It's challenging. It's collaborative. It's evolving, which is a good thing for those who like change, and perhaps scary for those who want solid footing in knowing exactly what their day will look like.

It feels truly awesome going to work and doing your best with wonderful (or any adjective that's synonymous with super amazing) colleagues who tough out the day together; it ain't easy, but that's why it's fun.

What I really LOVE about it is the fact that everything is so well defined through metrics, definition and time frame (as with everything else in the company actually).

The issue with having an open door policy with almost anything that goes on in the office, is that yes, you get fantastic feedback that could bring about the next big change, but on the other hand, it's getting pretty messy (with the company expanding so quickly). \r\n\r\nSurveys and regular 1-on-1 sessions with managers are effective in garnering qualitative responses, which are useful in identifying pain points/ suggestions.

Being here for a little over a year, I've seen us scale in number of employees, overall revenue generation, perks, and professional development opportunities.  We've seen hardships along the way, but I can honestly say that 80% of the changes we've made have been undoubtedly for the betterment of the company as a whole, and have spilled over unto us as individuals, to enrich our daily work life. Our constant push to always be improving really affects each of us in unique ways, and in my opinion it's always for the better.  \r\n\r\nOne of the top reasons I stay at HubSpot is because of the work/life balance and flexibility to make your own schedule.  Although my friends and family may not at times think I have the best \"work/life\" balance, the way I structure my time is completely up to me, and I capitalize on our Unlimited Vacation policy often.  It's incredibly refreshing to be able to map out your own days and schedule, and be able to enjoy things in life outside of work, whether they are during the typical work day or not. \r\n\r\nI've been able to grow on my own at HubSpot in numerous ways due to the autonomy that has been given to me, and our Culture + L&D teams have done tremendous work in making sure that outside and internal trainings are available and top of mind to anyone who would like to attend.

I think we can do a better job of operationalizing our day to day, without losing sight of our customers as the main focus.  I think in a lot of ways HubSpot isn't a company that appeals to everyone, and I think we need to change this approach as we grow.  While this may be okay when we are a mid-sized company, this won't be an optimal way to operate once we become very large.  There are many \"cultural issues\" we face as an organization, and while I feel our company culture is mostly positive, I think there are pockets of teams here that operate in ways that wouldn't work for every type of background/personality/culture, and in my opinion we need to look outside of our bubble more often to create a more conducive environment that serves all types of people around the globe if we want to stay relevant as a Global leader in our industry."}, {"review_title": "Great place to thrive as a high performer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you're dedicated and self-motivated, you'll do very well at HubSpot.

As you'll see, I'm solidly not that, but I love HubSpot, warts and all, and I firmly believe that the company has nowhere to go but up.\r\n\r\nI've seen people go from zero to near-C-level in under two years here. Is that everyone? Of course not. HubSpot absolutely means it when they say you can be a high-performing individual contributor your entire career (I am one). But for people who want to move up the org chart, and have the chops to do so, HubSpot absolutely provides the framework and the support to give someone that chance.\r\n\r\nThe perks are nice. Beer and unlimited vacation and a barista and all that good stuff is nice, but it's actually secondary. Because we have those perks, it means we only have people who can have those perks and not abuse them. The caliber of the \"average\" HubSpotter is anything but average. Every single HubSpotter has something to learn from and be impressed by.", "cons": "Remarkably few. One, because HubSpot is willing to take risks on people and helps them move up the ranks, people sometimes do get promoted before they're ready for it. There's nothing more demotivating than a bad manager, and I've seen entire teams underperform for months while a bad manager is either coached or replaced. I'm not sure there's an easy fix here. On the whole, it's a good thing that HubSpot gives those people those chances. There probably needs to be more guardrails and mentoring around this to identify where a newbie manager is potentially having cascading negative effects.\r\n\r\nSecond, and this one is some tough love from me, but it needs to be said: You need to toe the line on some things. If you're politically conservative, keep it to yourself. If you're liberal, preach it from the rooftops. HubSpot, for all its diversity and inclusion efforts (which are admirable!), does not allow for certain political viewpoints to be shared at all, and certainly not respected. On the one hand, it's not surprising that the majority of the company is more liberal. However, the Women@HubSpot and LGBTQ Alliance use Hillary Clinton campaign slogans in their \"official\" materials. I get it, I'm solidly liberal, and I don't think it's done with any sort of malice, but I've seen people basically shouted down and degraded for expressing any view that isn't solidly on the left side of our political spectrum. I know a few conservative folks at HubSpot, and I know for a fact they fear for their careers to even engage in debate on certain issues. It's never good for anyone to feel silenced, and in this manner, it's happening here. It's a glaring dark spot on HubSpot's supposed openness, and it needs to change. I am sure that it will in time, but it's something to be aware of if you are in that set and are considering HubSpot to work for right now.
