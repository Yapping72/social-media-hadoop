You can practically grow old and retire here if you do not mind the miserable salary and horrid long hours.", "cons": "Salary - Forget about fat bonuses if you are not from China (Not even Asians!!). The salary scale tipped the point of below mediocre and expect yourself to be like this for years to come. If you are holding a CHINA passport, yes there are perks beyond imagination like private shares, but if you are not, stop dreaming and look the other way. \r\nManagement - What's that again? That doesn't even exist!! You would likely be managed by some young chap who would be 10 - 15 years younger than you, sitting in his spanking office (with a door - CLOSED) and you?.. outside in a cube with the rest of the low-lifers. Customer meetings? - handle it yourself, they won't follow you when the meeting's agenda is about putting fighting fire. Some excuses like they would be busy the whole day or having other meetings. Good luck, buddy!\r\nCareer path - The only path that you would likely see is a path of flat line, no opportunities, no learning curve, just pure work.\r\nWork/life balance - You would likely be in a volatile situation, depending on your position. Product people are ok with some life. Sales/ Accounts people would need to find ways around this.\r\nCulture/Value - Yes, their culture, regardless of any country. The whole work environment is filled to the brim with propaganda posters supporting their own country and with gaudy colors of red and white, making you riddled with the fact that if you are in YOUR own country or Theirs!

If you're unemployment Chinese person, you can become HR BP in here in one day even if you don't know anything about HR. The only important thing is being Chinese native speaker. That's all. But if they try to hire local Turkish employee, they suddenly become too curious and start to ask difficult questions in the job interview. There is a Chinese cafeteria that only Chinese employee can eat there. Turkish local employees is not allowed :) Chinese managers do not care employee motivation at all. They're thinking like \"They can go If they want to, we will not do anything for them to stay\". I heard that sentence with my own ears :) They do not follow inflation rates, they do not raise salaries, they do not want to work hybrids etc. In short, they ignore all employee requests. The funny thing is, when an employee tries to quit, they suddenly start to panic and tell lies to get them to stay. They're really difficult people to understand. Some departments work from office while some of them working as hybrid. However, If you're working in a department which works 5 days from office, you will realise that even 5 days working from office is not enough for your Chinese Manager. They also want you to come to the office on Saturday for an unnecessary 6 hours meeting and they do not accept any \"excuse\" for not coming. Lastly, mobbing, mobbing everywhere.

At this point, they don't even care about their most capable developers leaving the company because they have a very low budget and the R&D director in Turkey doesn't have any authority. \r\n- Almost everyone at the company is looking for jobs. People got no commitment nor respect for the company anymore. The general morale in the company is very low. \r\n- Directors are leaving for better pay even if it's a lower position.\r\n- Almost all of the developers are interns and juniors. Therefore, there are many quality issues and bugs in the projects. You will never come across best practices. All they care about is creating a product and because of the incapability of the teams, they will force you to do overtime.\r\n- Too much bureaucracy and useless exams which will not help your carreer. \r\n- The HQ decides for everything and the teams in Turkey work as servants. \r\n- You have to deal with Chinese project managers from the HQ who neither can't speak English, nor will they understand you. If your English is fluent, they will warn you to speak bad English. \r\n- Depending on the HQ for almost all of the projects is really painful. \r\n- You are generally paid half of your net worth compared to similar positions in Turkey. If you are a fresh graduate, you will be working for little above the minimum wage. If you are a senior or a manager, you will be working for a junior's salary outside. The last average salary increase was 35% while the yearly inflation rate is about 300%. \r\n- Managers earn the same amount as developers. \r\n- Nor managers, neither the directors don't have any significant authority. - Weekly hero reward is a 50TL D&R gift card.\r\n- 80TL sodexo per day. \r\n- Baklava for the feast.\r\n- Biscuits and soft drinks at the R&D, and hopefully 200TL sodexo in the new year's eve. \r\n*P.S.
