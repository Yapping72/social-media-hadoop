This usually happens in large group settings so as to impose maximum embarrassment. Problem is its caused a culture of yes men around him where no one will tell him things are failing until its too late or they blindly direct their engineers to implement whatever random thought that comes out of Jensen's head without questioning or that no one wants to pick up potentially risky projects for fear of ridicule so they just get dropped.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the GeForce cash cow has allowed nvidia to put its head in the sand when everyone in the know knows that that business is not long for this earth as personal computing devices get smaller and more integrated. Tegra was to save us from that fate but with that business burning to the ground everyone seems entirely too happy to pretend like the temporary Maxwell win vs AMD is going to last forever. And yes, as AMD slowly dies a painful death nvidia will appear to grow, but once that fire is put out once and for all, GeForce will hit a ceiling and optimistically will decline slowly, but realistically it will probably have a few catastrophic cliffs as new generations of integrated parts take out more and more of the dedicated GPU business until they are no longer a feasible product category entirely. With Tegra dead that leaves only Tesla and Quadro, but those are products that rely entirely on GeForce's high volume to make the businesses make any sense at all. That would turn nvidia into yet another HPC only company and will see the same fate as Cray, Sparc, SGI and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond that when I finally decided to move on I was blown away by the offers I got elsewhere.

During this time, my experience at NVIDIA has taken a sharp turn downward. \r\n\r\n* The only reward for good work at NVIDIA is more work: if you do well you will just get more tasks piled on yourself. You will _not_ get a (significant) bonus, a promotion, or a team. \r\n* NVIDIA hires really good people and give them an unreasonable amount of work. Almost everyone is drowning in work and emails. (I have 40-50 hours of meetings every week, plus 300-500 emails per day to respond to.) The company gets away with this by hiring really good people who try to do the best for their business, but in the end its just exploitation since they don't give anything back.\r\n* As was pointed out in several other reviews: EStaff is in very weak. 80% of them are Jensen's buddies since the early days. They have made $50-200M each, know they won't get fired, and that they will never get promoted. So they play with their pet projects and zoom in to micromanage what interests them.\r\n* Non-existent HR policy: there are _no_ promotion paths. You will stay at the level you were hired at. What makes this fact extra sour is that there is a huge number of under performers at director level and above. \r\n* Compensation looks good on paper and on comparison sites like this one, but one you realize there are no 401k contributions the story isn't so pretty anymore.\r\n\r\nIn short: avoid. The only good reason to join NVIDIA is if you want some quick experience, but make sure you have an exit plan."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "1 Oct 2013", "job_title": "Engineering Manager in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "*Awesome people, they hire the best.
