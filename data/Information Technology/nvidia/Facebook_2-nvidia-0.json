Not like a lot of companies that only do what makes money most in the near future. This puts Nvidia in a unique position domainting the tech industry in certain domains as by the time others realize the importance of the work done here, we are way ahead of them already. - Nvidia is the one company that has most computer graphics experts, especially in the domain of real time ray tracing. Working with the best people is also a nice perk that not a lot of other companies can offer. - Nvidia treats employee really well. This includes company perks, fair compensation, etc. - Nvidia treats employee with a lot of respect.

This is reinforced through various company initiatives such as Free day, decision making to save variable costs but not at the expense of human investments, access to care (ex: health, child, etc.) as well as growth (ex: academic journals, learnings, conferences, etc.)\n\n2.

Collaboration - Structuring the organization to be extremely collaborative where synergies can be achieved and a possibility to do one's life's best work\n\n4.

Company is highly focused on software and the importance of the software stack to their success. Being at a ton of semiconductor companies that treated software/drivers as an afterthought to selling hardware this company took a different approach in the beginning and continues to really respect the value of good software. Makes for a good environment for software devs that care about doing things right. 2. I really like the mix of long term highly experienced folks and young talent. There are a lot of people at NVIDIA that have been here for a *LONG* time. The cooperation is really, really good amongst the 'new guys' and those that have all of the tribal knowledge. Every group i've worked with has been very cooperative and very willing to help. 3. Company is very focused on the value good software brings to the table. This drives a code base that is generally in excellent shape. I've seen way too many code bases at mature companies that are an absolute mess but this is not one of them. The attention to design, quality, etc. is apparent. and it makes it much easier to learn and maintain the code and follow up from the example. Granted i've not seen all the code but what i touch, though being a huge code base is well structured, easy to read, and a treat to work on. 4. Benevolence. Most companies will tout that the people are important but I see NVIDIA really does follow through on this. What they did for the employees during COVID was really telling. Starts at the CEO and down (\"attitude reflects leadership\"). He truely cares about each of us and want us to care about others outside of work. There are a lot of people at NVIDIA that have made a lot of money over they years and they want to share it. It's realy nice to work with people that have this attitude as opposed to the greedy (corporate greed) mentality. 5.

Benefits are fantastic. Loads of cool projects going on.", "cons": "I will admit that there are some spectacular positives about working at NVIDIA. The benefits are top-notch, the stock is promising, the support during this pandemic has been fantastic, and the vision for the future is bright. On top of it all, the company is led by a true visionary, who is compassionate and genuinely cares for his employees. Unfortunately, that quality leadership does not trickle down to lower-management.\r\n\r\nStructurally, NVIDIA boasts about being a \u201cflat organization,\u201d where all thoughts, ideas, and suggestions are heard and implemented. While this rings true across several teams, I have not been fortunate enough to experience this myself. \r\n\r\nThe lower-mid management here is astonishingly toxic. Of course not all, but many managers solely focus on promoting their favorite employees and ways to get a promotion themselves. The only way you\u2019ll be promoted and recognized for your hard work is if you loudly kiss up to the right people, play into the political games, and keep any complaints or suggestions for improvements to yourself. Management heavily relies on their personal relationships or feelings towards individuals in order to dictate who gets recognition and opportunities. Want a promotion? Ask them to lunch. Get little gifts for them. Chit-chat about frivolous things, such as exercise classes or shopping. I\u2019ve seen many quality, hard-working employees get overlooked despite dedicating hours of overtime or going above and beyond, simply because they refuse to play into the game and are not the \u2018ideal employee,\u2019 according to whatever the manager has in mind.\r\n\r\nAnd to be quite honest, that \u2018ideal employee\u2019 is NOT a person of color. As mentioned before, management has biases towards people who look a certain way, dress a certain way, speak a certain way, have certain hobbies and interests\u2026I\u2019m sure you can read between the lines. If you\u2019re a diverse candidate, they will want you to join to help their pitiful diversity numbers, not because they will value or honor what you have to bring. They will smile and nod at your suggestions, just to tuck them away in favor of the opinions of the ones they actually like and respect.\r\n\r\nAnother alarming red flag that I\u2019ve seen has been witnessing MULTIPLE work-place bullies be praised for their \u201cpassion\u201d to their role, when in reality, all they\u2019ve actually done is steamroll over others, throw folks under the bus, and cover it all up by using pretty words to win management\u2019s favor. It\u2019s disgustingly obvious, and although those same people have been addressed to management AND HR *multiple* times, all that results is them getting a light slap on the wrist and a 15-minute talk for formalities purposes. And then a few months down the line, you\u2019ll see that same employee get promoted or converted to full-time, with praises adorned.\r\n\r\nSpeaking up, or standing up for yourself or others, only yields a target being placed on your back, and being gossiped about by the very same toxic people and management. I\u2019ve witnessed numerous managers gossiping about their own employees as if this is some high school popularity contest. All of the injustice wears down any employee who gathers the courage to try and make a positive change, and leads to them becoming jaded and giving up on any hope that the situation will turn for the better.\r\n\r\nWork-life balance is non-existent. No, they will not tell you to work overtime, but you will be praised for it if you do. This leads to a nasty cycle of employees doing extra work (like they see everyone else doing) because they think it\u2019s the norm, or will be what gets them praises as well. My suggestion is to just do your work within normal business hours, and clock out completely if you can. No matter how hard you may work, you won\u2019t get promoted unless you\u2019re your manager\u2019s favorite, anyway.\r\n\r\nPerhaps among all the numerous praises flooding NVIDIA\u2019s company reviews here on Glassdoor, this will just be seen as a \u201cbitter\u201d employee airing out their grievances. I\u2019m certain that HR/management will see it this way.

Unreal... same title had 3 levels so I had no idea until a few months after joining. So the RSU refreshers were much lower than discussed with recruiter.\r\n b) Waited several years for my manager to let me do the work we agreed to upon joining before moving on. \r\n3) Only long term employees get promoted (or those with same race/ethnicity as VP). \r\n a) I experienced complete reverse discrimination while there (VP only promoted those of same race/ethnicity). Those of this race/ethnicity treated me like garbage and the VP (and other similar race/ethnicity managers under him) protected them and retaliated and beat-up on me for complaining. \r\n4) From what I saw, all new employees get treated like garbage by the long-timers at this company. Ironic since they have been there a long time and are making significantly more than you due to stock run-up. \r\n a) A big part of the problem is that this company has no peer review system in place for annual or real-time feedback, so when folks behave in an outrageous manner, there is nothing you can do but try to ignore it. Totally broken review system.\r\n5) People only respect you if you've been with the company a minimum of 5y.... time spent with the company is like a badge of honor. Ideas and industry experience gained outside Nvidia are disregarded/ignored (Nvidia is *not* interested in how things are done elsewhere in industry.... it's their way or the highway type of mentality). In my case, I had ~20y industry experience (specialization) in a particular area, and they wouldn't even invite me to meetings (I practically had to beg to contribute). No one at Nvidia had anywhere near the level of experience or knowledge I had in this area.... folks that were hacks were listened to like they were experts. It was amazing. I was used to being the subject matter expert for a company with 200,000 employees, but at Nvidia...with <10000 employees, they refused to allow me to be a subject matter expert (my director actually rejected my request to contribute).\r\n6) People working here displayed a complete lack of integrity/honesty (although this happens at some other companies too).\r\n7) The labs at NVIDIA are a disaster.
