Annual bonuses barely account for inflation. Equity grants are the main form of compensation. \r\n- Job insecurity is a constant. Over the three years I worked at Tesla, I witnessed about 6 rounds of layoffs. This has a negative impact on morale and everyone always has one foot out the door in preparation of being let go.\r\n- Tesla does not value individual knowledge or expertise. Tesla is the only company I've worked at where it is acceptable to announce on a Wednesday that you are leaving the company and then be gone by Friday. There is no effort to transition knowledge or roles, leaving to inefficiencies and knowledge gaps. \r\n- High attrition due to constant layoffs creates an unstable environment in which management/senior leadership is constantly changing, strategy is changing and knowledge is lost. \r\n- Tesla is a VERY demanding company. There is almost an expectation for employees to avoid incurring expenses and therefore employees will often pay for business expenses out of pocket. You will be expected to work long hours and be flexible to do so especially at every end of quarter. Due to this level of demand, Tesla is not a supportive place for parents or those with significant personal demands. \r\n- Because everyone is overworked, it is difficult to get follow-through from other teams and constant follow-up is required.\r\n- 80% of Tesla's workforce is under 35. While this creates many opportunities for those early in their career, there is often a lack of functional expertise and professional maturity. \r\n- Elon has final say on everything and will not be challenged by others, including his direct reports, for fear of losing their jobs.\r\n- Due to constant attrition, people managers and leaders are regularly purged. This creates an environment in which employees are rewarded for being average performers for fear of being promoted and then eventually fired. Many people who have remained at Tesla in the long term (i.e. 7-10 years) have done so by flying under the radar and avoiding visibility, creating a perverse incentive for mediocrity. \r\n- Many departments are male dominated and have a \"bro\" culture, with few women at the Senior Manager level and above. There are few people of color at the Senior Manager level and above. There is a lack of diversity within leadership and a lack of effort to cultivate and retain a diverse pipeline of leadership talent. Diversity is not integrated into the company culture as demonstrated by the radio silence from senior leadership this year (aside from the sole Black executive). \r\n- Career growth is not well tracked or managed. There was a period of 1.5 years where no formal performance reviews (or salary increases) were conducted. Promotions and compensation are HIGHLY dependent on the manager. It is not uncommon for someone to be underpaid or not receive a promotion for years because a manager is more focused on managing their personal job security vs. advocating for the team."}, {"review_title": "Best role I've had", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Inside Sales Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High impact work\r\nStrong culture\r\nGreat team", "cons": "Whole sales department has been turned over multiple times in the past."}, {"review_title": "Headache", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Logistics in Melbourne", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice to put Tesla on CV", "cons": "Bad management , a lot of ego in the work place, doing a lot of the grunt work, processes are still in early stages growing pains at the moment..

There is little regard for employee happiness or improvement. Very little upward mobility within certain regions of the sales organizations as most management hires come from outside Tesla. Executive team doesn't solicit feedback other than a company-wide annual survey. \r\n\r\nINFORMATION: Important information is often withheld from salespeople until the last minute which harms our relationships with our customers and loses all trust. Product and process updates are often revealed to the public before employees.  \r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION: All Owner Advisors (salespeople) are held to the same standards regardless of location. This creates enormous disparities in pay between salespeople based on luck (location and popularity), rather than effort or talent. Within the same role and region, some people make $200k+/year while others make $42k/year. On top of that, the lowest-performing Owner Advisors typically get fired each quarter. Compensation plans come from the top-down and are variable, non-negotiable, and often detrimental to our annual take-home pay.\r\n\r\nThere are only two reasons why people stay at Tesla:\r\n - They are lucky enough to be in a high volume location which makes them a lot of money\r\n - They care deeply about the mission and are willing to be treated poorly by the executive team to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy"}, {"review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Production Associate in Fremont, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay\r\nGood benefits\r\nLearn a lot", "cons": "Draining\r\nMind numbing\r\nIts hard to move up in the company"}, {"review_title": "salary", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Associate Maintenance Manager in Fremont, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good solid place to learn", "cons": "very fast paced and can be a culture shock"}, {"review_title": "Could improve", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Finance Specialist in Clarkston, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Outstanding Health insurance\r\nManagers push you to be a better employee and challenge you\r\nSick pay", "cons": "Management styles vary, communication at times lacking.\r\nExpects too much from employees at time - fine line often crossed and blurred\r\n10 days vacation"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Mobile Diagnostic Technician in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, teamwork, great management, feelings of success after every day.", "cons": "Overnight shifts, weekends, other than that no cons."}], [{"review_title": "Competitive co-workers, fast-paced environment.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Customer Experience Specialist in Fremont, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great room for growth in the factory and beyond.", "cons": "Can sometimes be a competitive environment."}, {"review_title": "Frustrating, but rewarding", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Material Handler", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits are really good", "cons": "Pay is not adequate or equal to the work expected of you, and getting a promotion is more about politics than work ethic"}, {"review_title": "Eh", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Senior Ops Specialist in Westmont, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, pay, friendships made along the way, being apart of a revolutionary company", "cons": "Leadership lacks in a lot of ways, business structure needs to be improved"}, {"review_title": "Tesla is great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Forklift Operator in Lathrop, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay and good work hours", "cons": "Night shifts and that\u2019s really just about it"}, {"review_title": "Never a dull moment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "26 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Associate Manager in Fremont, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Versatility and the ability to work with every team, very few silos.", "cons": "Ambiguity at times, the fast pace means lots of last minute changes and communication could suffer"}, {"review_title": "Great company to admire, not great to work for", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Insides Sales Executive in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This company is literally changing the world and it is incredible to watch.", "cons": "When you are able to justify treating your employees poorly by leaning on your mission of \"changing the world\" you need to re-evaluate."}, {"review_title": "Make sure you ask for all the job specific requirements, especially hours", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Operations Manager in South Farmingdale, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of work if you want it", "cons": "Job was not as advertised"}, {"review_title": "Great Place to work.

I have been with the company with quite some time and have worked across most engineering groups with the exception of the infotainment division.\r\n\r\n- ISOs and RSUs. I entered prior to the stock hike. Company-provided options and RSU grants for achievement has been a big financial reward and will continue to be until full vesting. This is important and one of the top three reasons Tesla has me staying put with the company (see Cons below)\r\n- Opportunities to learn. The company moves fast and because of that there has been a multitude of opportunities for me to interact across various technical groups. I have had the opportunity without any hindrances, due to my role, to gain a holistic understanding of the technology behind this vehicle. It's special to say the very least.\r\n- Bright minds. Tesla has acquired top-talent in its early days (I cannot say the same now see below). the backbone of the company has been the engineers with the confidence and courage to tackle challenges no one else has ever attempted. Many other automotive companies have come to recognize that Tesla is a competitor and looming threat.\r\n- Advancement. Up until recent months, Tesla did a fairly decent jobs at providing opportunities for advancement. This was in part due to its very loose structuring (leveling didn't officially happen until a few months ago...) and also in part because you truly were recognized for your experience, knowledge, and impact. If you were promoted from level 1 to level 2, you earned it, if you were promoted from level 1 to staff (level 4) you changed the approach for something crucial and you definitely earned it. You got what you earned, and even though recognition came slowly, I can't think of many companies that would have let someone jump from level 1 to level 4 regardless of the fact they were qualified just out of tradition.\r\n\r\nBottom line. Though I am still young in my career, in comparison to many other senior engineers at other companies, whether they are friends, family, or acquaintances, I know that in my time with Tesla, the experience and knowledge I have gained has been 2x to 3x greater than what they received in the same amount of time. It came at the expense of very hard and tediou work and deadlines. But I made it work out.", "cons": "People interested in applying to Tesla now must be aware of several things. \r\n\r\nMy comments are particularly applicable to engineers. As Tesla continues to grow to support all of its upcoming activities (read the news) one of its biggest challenges is management. It is very apparent that the culture to a degree is shifting from a \"start-up\" mentality to a very particular vision of what proper management should look like. This includes leveling, improving documentation, enforcing best-practices, etc. There is one very big drawback that anyone looking to join a cutting edge company should be wary of: this is slowly KILLING the original culture of doing what is necessary, thinking outside the box, promoting cross-group interaction. Elon won\u2019t ever let this culture shift touch the side of innovation and technological advance thankfully. This I am certain of as it would kill the heart of Tesla's edge.\r\n\r\nI have been fortunate enough in my career that I just made it onto the \"old Tesla' side of the team. This is a group of people who recognize there are management challenges and there is need to improve on those now, but also understand there is a need to minimize internal politics to remain one team. It is also a team of individuals that have leveraged and maintained a particular amount of political pull to keep that system in-line to a degree. Let me draw on one generic example. A large group discovered a flaw that was in part due to decisions made along with another group, and instead of approaching the problem with a \u201clet\u2019s fix this\u201d attitude, they \u201cstrategically waited\u201d until the other group confronted and accepted responsibility before acting towards resolution. This, in my mind, is unacceptable. \r\n\r\nWhat I have been witnessing in the transformation of the company is a greater dependence on politics.  Be prepared if you are an associate level engineer to be told exactly what you are allowed to do. And if you are senior level, know that you are entering potentially shark-infested waters depending on what division you are working for. Ask as you apply and interview to learn more about the dynamics. \r\n\r\nThe last downside is compensation. Tesla targets average pay, nothing less, nothing more, unless you are a rare candidate with such specific expertise that no one else like you exists. If you are that individual, you will be treated well (senior manager, exec, VP level). As a new hire, you do not have as much of an edge with your options. Your strike price will also be significantly higher than \u201colder\u201d Tesla colleagues. You will get paid enough to live on, but without the added bonus of ISOs at your side helping to ease the pain as you work tirelessly each and every day, you will find it more difficult to make it at Tesla. \r\n\r\nThe company and used top talent and let them go off to other companies after they were burnt and ground to ashes. I\u2019ve seen some of the best engineers leave under these circumstances. And as many other reviewers have mentioned, if you decide to take a job with this promising company, know you WILL sacrifice work-life balance, your family with see less of you, and you will have to make sacrifices while you stay at Tesla. You will get down and dirty. In return you will hopefully receive bonuses and rewards for your hard work and you can say you were part of it all, changing the mindset of all people, and shifting the paradigm and direction of personal-vehicle technology."}, {"review_title": "Passt am anfang.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Finance Specialist in Munich, Bavaria", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Young Team.

We work long hours (12 hour shifts) but its well worth it when we get 3-4 day weekends. Work clothing is provided by Tesla but you can also wear your own personal clothing as long as it is up to code they provide steel toed shoes as well. PTO is easy to obtain you could potentially take a paid day off every month. You can move up in the company very fast as long as you have the drive and put in the effort to do so I have worked for companies that require alot more physical and mental labor for a lot less pay and terrible benefits so I think Ill stay at Tesla as long as they will keep me.

Some associates are allowed to take 30 minute breaks and hour long lunches while others sometimes only get their lunch. Supervisors and managers do not enforce HR policies, safety policies and workmanship policies. \r\n\r\nLake Tesla- Parking lot doesn't have drainage. When it snows and rains the parking lot becomes flooded . \r\n\r\nTime off policy- You can only take a day off if you have pto and there is no unpaid time off. This means if you're sick and have no pto you're forced to come into work sick. This is terrible business practice and shows the company  doesn't care about employee's. There should be pto and unpaid time off. A good company will give you pto and up to 40 hours of unpaid time off to cover times when you're sick and have no pto. \r\n\r\nRoad Condition- The road conditions are terrible here. Poor lighting, huge pot holes, and poor road striping. \r\n\r\nOverall: Find a better and more enjoyable palce to work.
