There is a lot of higher level management turnover (I couldn't even tell you how many director's I've been through) so things change constantly. For those of us who've been here a long time, we laugh any time a new director comes in and says lets change everything to this (which usually is an idea which has been tried multiple times and failed). Also, the biggest con for me is the layoffs, there is always a huge threat of layoffs... I've been here almost 6 years and its pretty consistent they do layoffs every 6-9 months. And then they decide we don't have enough people and hire for all the positions they just laid off at less money. So if you do join Tesla, please know that things will change constantly (I've worked in many areas and it's the same across all of them) and they can change by the minute. Also, be prepared for the performance structure to change and for it only to get more confusing. I've been through 3 or 4 performance structure changes and been denied raises a few times because of it (not because my performance was bad... my performance has always been great... I got denied raises because they only give each team so much $$). If your whole team is great, then one of you isn't getting a raise. Also, there's A LOT of stress. Since things change so often, you get comfortable with one process only to have to completely learn a new one. And if you don't learn it quickly, your performance gets dinged. Also, if you work here, make sure to put boundaries in early. Do NOT let them take advantage of you just because you want to prove yourself...

Leaders often refer to the culture of Tesla as a meritocracy - which sounds like a good thing (the hardest working people get the biggest reward) however that culture comes with a double edged sword. This concept really only benefits people who are young and single and willing to work longer hours and constantly say yes. If you're a yes-man or an \"idea-man\" you will get promoted, even with no experience managing people. There is a huge amount of turnover in all departments. The turnover massively hurts team morale and work life balance suffers because of it. Typically if someone resigns, Tesla asks them to leave immediately without any reasonable time to help find a replacement, and a whole team takes over their work until they can hire someone. Since Tesla is frugal, they will often promote someone from a lower level and ask them to do both their current job and their bosses job, with not enough compensation and not enough training or experience to succeed.

It was made clear from day one on that nobody cared about me no matter how hard I worked on the line, solid employees were fired over trivial things, poorer performing employees stuck around if they sucked up enough to supervisors and leads. My group got written up for the dumbest and most inconsequential reasons no matter how perfect we were up to the point of the incident occurring, and positive feedback was rarely given out to anybody. Leads walk around yelling at associates to do something when the line slows down even though the work is exhausting and the breaks are way too short. \n- I cannot stress this enough, days are 12 hours long, you get four 10 min breaks and one unpaid 30 min lunch, that's it. The job is exhausting, you are pretty much always on your feet, always lifting, moving, bending, reaching, and putting your body in stressful positions over and over again. Over time this is absolutely taxing and doing it multiple days in a row can totally exhaust you. There's not much that the company can do if you get hurt aside from send someone to check on where you are experiencing pain and offer advice and stretches, but more often than not it won't result in any long-term solution. Tesla encourages proper ergonomics and to not put yourself in a position to get hurt, but at times it's basically impossible to do that. \n- Break areas are fine for what they are, its hard to get access to a microwave no matter how many are within the area. Some associates will steal your food if you put them in the fridge. I had my backpack rifled through on one occasion. I recommend bringing a lock for your things.\n- Bathrooms are unacceptably filthy, in disarray, and way too far from the line. This is the only job I worked where going to the bathroom was ever a problem. There are never enough people on the line to fill in for you while you take care of a basic human need. Leads and supervisors were always super rude about you needing to take care of business.\n- If you are late or have to excuse yourself from your shift within 2 hours of your shift start you are basically screwed. Tesla does not take absences lightly nor do they want you being late at all, even if its just by a few minutes. It is very easy to get written up for not being on time and you can get yourself fired if you call out too often.\n- ESPP and the income for a production associate are kind of oversold as a positive when its anything but that. Starting hourly pay is essentially poverty wage in the Bay Area and you only get overtime pay after 10 hours, not 8 hours like you would think. Because of the stock prices, it will take forever for ESPP to be a solid incentive.\n- There really isn't much room to move up within general assembly, your ceiling is really becoming a supervisor after becoming a lead and there's basically a never ending logjam to get there. It also seems like Tesla drags their feet on hiring for internal roles and its hard to really stick out if nobody will stick up for you."}, {"review_title": "Best company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "29 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Scrum Meister in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "very imaginative and full of spunk", "cons": "very musky smell in basement"}, {"review_title": "Waste of time", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Just doing this for the credits", "cons": "None that I experienced in my time"}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Manufacturing Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- employee discount\r\n- great culture", "cons": "- very numbers focused\r\n- lay offs"}], [{"review_title": "God is here", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very place to work, Elon is great", "cons": "Toilets are very poor and smelly"}, {"review_title": "Hard Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Customer Experience Specialist in Burbank, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of room for growth and fast moving pace.", "cons": "Super hard deadlines and goals.

Long hours, flexible for some but not most especially manufacturing, management supervisors leads, yup the same story, they put people in charge who put people they make friends with in charge of other people and not experience in leadership. Those who supervise do not give good hard works the opportunities they should be given while others who just bs their way around the place get promoted and raises. They say \u201cWe want you to go home in a better condition than what came in to work. I was hurt my supervisor told others I was lying then the manager was focused on me being in the break room. Because he didn\u2019t know I was on a special project and we were on break. Some people may care but the people I worked directly under did not! Pay is not great because a worker is worthy of his wages, they don\u2019t see us like we\u2019re worthy. Benefits are just okay and I say that because this is non-union work place you have no protection and our benefits should cost us close to nothing like longshoreman. For the automotive industry the pay should be should be a lot higher like Nummi was. The only pro for me was working at Tesla I learned a skill to go somewhere else and I only learned that from the few good people around me. After four years I never was fully vested and when I left they said it wasn\u2019t four years but it was surly. I know everyone needs a job but Tesla is not very professional in manufacturing. There\u2019s a lot of clicks going on with this street attitude and disrespect and racism thrives there on the floor.

Going over your manager is almost expected if that is the best/quickest way forward. Goals are determined collaboratively and you are mostly left to your own to achieve the solution. Manager helps in getting resources or giving direction as required and periodic checks on progress help keep you on track. Successes are duly recognized and rewarded but the important thing here is that failure does not make you an outcast. The only expectation is conscientiousness and thoughtful actions.\r\n3) Driven Team- You know you have made it to the top as an engineer if you manage to get hired at Tesla. Team mates  are extremely competent/driven individuals and easy to work with. The general theme is that the team rises or falls together. I have seen this attitude at work in several cross functional projects.
