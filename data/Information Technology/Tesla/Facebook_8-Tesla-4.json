Manager can hit bonus level much quicker while individual OAs will get in trouble for not hitting a much higher individual number. Regardless of region, state, or store level traffic, the individual OA is held accountable for the same sales number across the country, this doesn't make any since as not all regions, states, city's have the same traffic and interest. \r\n\r\nZero path or internal support for career growth. Have been hearing about how they are working on that for over 2 years now but still nothing no internal career portal as of this writing. Regional level management sees you as a number and you will not be recognized as a person unless you are knocking your numbers out of the park, \"what have you done for me lately?\" mentality. If you are a puppet and enjoy being at someones beck and call then your looking for the right place. Zero advertising and majority of the public still thinks buying the vehicles is illegal in most states, so you normally start the sales process from that step. Requires a TON of educating before you can actually move to the sales/closing process. \r\n\r\nWhat work life balance? Not asked but expected to work 6/7 days a week, there are no 9-5 positions here so don't waste your time. Given a phone and laptop, enough said!  You will be expected to bleed for this company and only if your a top performer will you exist in managements eyes.

Things are rapidly becoming super corporate and the way things are run, seems very systematic and machine-like.  Before, it was more about overall customer experience.  Now, it's be efficient, get their info, pass on the lead to make a sale.   \r\n\r\nAlso, if you want to become full-time at Tesla, be aware that you start part-time 30hrs a week at $13/hr, no commission, for about a year before you will be considered for a promotion, even if your work performance is solid.  Salary for a full-timer in sales is about $40,000 annually.  Commission is $60-$70 for every car you sell.  This is factual information. Yes, I do find it a bit strange that you get $60 dollars for every $100,000 car you sell, BUT on the bright side, you still get your $40,000. (Note: Sales and delivery positions count for 90-95% of the company's jobs)\r\n\r\nRecently, they have been increasing entry-level position, part-time workers and decreasing the number of full-time workers because from a corporate standpoint, you do not have to pay healthcare, benefits, etc., less money to be put out.  The goal is to have more part-time workers to do a full-time worker jobs for less benefits and less company expenses for the benefit of the corporation, as well as top shareholders.  I think this model is a fantastic idea to follow if you own a big corporation.  If I ever own a corporation, I want to follow this example to increase my wealth.  Very smart idea!\r\n\r\nTesla Motors, though, is a good company, esp with the technology and innovative machines they are creating.  I really hope they strive to help mother earth in 2-3 years with their $30,000-$50,000 vehicle to positively preserve the environment for the better of the every man.  Realistically, how it's going, I think it'll be more towards the $40,000-$50,000 range vs. $30,000 because it has to make company profit.\r\n\r\nOverall though, I hope that Tesla can positively impact the world and really help people in polluted cities and make the world a healthier and happier place to live in (while keeping it at an affordable price for the majority of people to buy for the sake of the environment)!"}, {"review_title": "Gallery Manager", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Gallery Manager in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working for Tesla is a glorified experience as the company carries a prestige name that many want to be a part of.

If you can't rely on the financials, you should not partake in ownership of the company. Tesla gets a free pass at a lot of it's activities due to the brand image. There are a lot of hidden bodies that are bound to be found at some point. The culture encourages somewhat of a cover up or a way to push financial issues down the road. Top dollar is paid to make a nasty outlook and financial result, seem good...but again, they don't get enough scrutiny. If an employee raises an issue that is not on management's list of 'will this news bring more money' ... it get's buried and the employee is removed from future meetings so they always get filtered. This is a big reason as to why there is such high turnover in the Finance and Accounting group. Throwing money (equity) their way just makes them more uncomfortable in doing the dirty work. Invest the money, get more reliable results, an investors need to aware that even the auditors are drinking the Kool Aid in expectation that their profile will have the next Google or Apple. \r\n\r\nThe SEC and PCAOB should really look deeper.

People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they spoon feed high priority info upward, making their visibility they output of their work. So there are layers of non-value add individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no system to actually do anything about that because \"emotional intelligence\" or \"sustainable systems\" are not taken seriously.\r\n\r\n4) Schmucks, the fast paced environment in combination with the spoon feeding middle management results in a toxic atmosphere, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. Many managers straight-up intimidate/scare their employees into compliance of doing exactly what they want them to at that exact time (extreme micromanagement), without even understanding the priorities that person has (resulting in no-win situations and poor performance overall).  This intimidation is a blue collar management tactic that doesn\u2019t work on highly trained, highly intelligent engineers.\r\n\r\n5) It's a big company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.

CEO/founder Elon Musk is an inspiration and leader for our generation and these are reasons why I wanted to start a career with Tesla and why I stuck around so long. A game changing and innovative company.", "cons": "With new companies come growing pains and in my case the sales department. At my particular location I experienced a lot of disappointment in company decisions and who they allow to call the shots. After being hired as an owner advisor (sales person) I got a substantial salary pay cut after only two weeks. I was told to \"roll with the punches\" and \"aren't I lucky to be part of this great mission and the Tesla team?\" I continued the job but not without notifying HR that it seemed extremely misleading and unfair considering I had turned down other job offers to work at Tesla with the initial income we agreed upon in mind. They reminded me that they can change how much they pay their employees, that changes could be made whenever they want, as often as they want and there's nothing I can do about it. The general public seems to think that the sales staff is commission based or receives a large percentage of commission per car and this is not true. Unlike car dealerships, the sales staff is either hourly or salary with a lousy fluctuating commission of under $100 per car (average Model S sells for about 110k). That being said, the overall pay is nowhere near what people think. Tesla tends to hire a young staff and seeks \"energetic and innovative talent\" but this could be because no seasoned professional would tolerate drastic company-wide policy changes and what goes on behind the scenes. I left a career at Tesla Motors because I could not tolerate my manager's behavior one moment longer. I contacted HR multiple times because he had created such a hostile work environment.  Every co-worker I had at the time and every single one after me has contacted HR about this man. Every single one. He's a huge liability to the company and yet miraculously still has the same job, having only been given light warnings for his actions. Early on while I was still training he cursed me out in front of customers and my new coworkers. He wanted me to follow around one of the sales members like a puppy, not leaving their side and when I went across the room to get something he used profanities at me because I disobeyed his orders and wasn't following their every shadow. He told me to pretend like I have a rope tied to my waist and my co-workers waist. This was in front of my new colleagues and a customer he was talking to. It was humiliating and demeaning. I would soon come to find that this guy lives for drama. He tries to play the employees against each other by stirring up rumors and gossip and creating jealousy by giving sales-orders (and with it commission) to whomever he likes most that week. He curses at employees, yells and points in their faces, makes employees come into work on days off and makes them do excessive work from home during time off. So much verbal abuse, harassment, drama, ego-trips, power-trips, and aggression. It often left the staff shaking, crying or just quitting all together. I was eventually offered a promotion and graciously accepted. I'd be transferring to the delivery department and would finally get away from this guy. Weeks turned into months before I went to job shadow. It was 5 months later before they were ready for me but it wasn't at the location I had been promised and training at rather an hour and a half away. I declined because I did not want a 3 hour daily commute and was always told I'd be working at the place 20 minutes from my house. When I declined they tried putting me on a guilt trip saying, \"it's a shame you'd pass up such an amazing opportunity because of your car. And we were going to offer you ___(an amount lower than my sales salary)\". In short, it was never a promotion, just a way to incise me to work there. Some say delivery is worse than sales. A guy I know who works there is sometimes required to work seven days a week during every end of the quarter. Seven! How is this legally possible? For the 60-70 hour work weeks he put in (I am not exaggerating here) his salary divided into hourly didn't fall below minimum wage so it was legal even though he was working around the clock, making minimum wage with no overtime compensation. Once the realization hit that there was no place better to transfer to (unless I wanted to relocate to headquarters in Palo Alto) I knew my days with Tesla were officially numbered. The last straw came when my manger came into work on his day off for the sole purpose of yelling at me because he didn't like the way I worded an email. Worst work experience of my life. So bittersweet because everyone who finds out I worked for Tesla praises the car, the company and knows me to be passionate for the cause (I drive an EV and still preach Tesla). But if they know me well enough, they've heard the stories of a company that's still working out the kinks and a sales manager who is so absurdly inappropriate and out of line."}, {"review_title": "Sales Organization", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Manager in Mesa, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent opportunity for merit based promotion on an extremely accelerated timeline.

Horrible, unqualified management, 2.) low pay, extreme hours and high demand, 3.) zero support and poor communication. \r\n\r\nThe long version:\r\nManagement, particularly on the sales side of the organization, is a major failure. Starting from the top down, the initiative for the past couple years has been to bring in people from the fashion or \"high end retail\" industries who have ZERO knowledge of the product, the company culture, the automotive industry, and no desire to actually learn about it. These people are given management positions without proper training or education, and lack even minimal base knowledge to do their jobs well so instead they rely on statistics/metrics in hopes that they can succeed by playing a numbers game. They do not have good intentions for the company or it's long-term success, and have completely destroyed what was once a great culture and environment to be a part of. People who have worked for the company for years and dedicated themselves to the mission aren't given any consideration, and very few promotions from within ever occur anymore. There is rampant sexism and favoritism at almost every level, if you have any aspirations to advance in your career, it won't happen here. \r\n\r\nThe pay is awful, you will be expected to work a minimum of 60-70 hours a week, available 7 days a week, for a 40hr/week salary. Commission for sales is insulting (approximately one-thousandth of a percent of the cost of the vehicle), you don't get paid until the car is delivered (which, as a member of the sales team, you have ZERO control over and can take 8+ weeks in some cases), and you get to work in an environment where your employment is constantly being threatened by your boss(es). \r\n\r\nHR doesn't do anything to correct any issues brought to their attention, they do not look out for the interest of the employees in any way, shape, or form. Emails and phone calls to just about any department often go ignored on a consistent basis, and regardless of how valid it may be, no one at any level of management wants to hear about the problems that exist and how to fix them. If you speak up, you will most certainly have a target on your back and I guarantee you will be subject to retaliation at some point or another. It is abundantly clear that the employees who are down in the trenches, bending over backwards to try and achieve targets and satisfy customers are thought of as completely expendable.

If you have a family with children, it's almost near impossible to have a constant schedule each week. \r\n-Small office that hosts 10 people at any given time.  Approx 100 sq/ft no windows, people eating over top of each other, and silly shenanigans that they young staff  partake in. \r\n-Very childish behavior from both staff and management.

Doesn't matter if they are garbage or Hot leads they just want another phone number or email to add their hundreds of thousands of contacts that they already have in their ever growing data base. \r\n-Regional management lives in a Ivory tower and has never walked the talk.   Some with huge egos that typically enjoy talking down to staff with nonsense stories that have no relation to the current role within Tesla. \r\n-Unrealistic goals that are almost stretch goals and unattainable even for the top performers\r\n-Malls are going to be distressed assets in the near future.  The footprint of malls are shrinking with more and more stores closing, resulting in a fewer foot traffic. \r\n-Being told that cold calls are not allowed, and only reaching out to those who have raised their hand for additional information. \r\n-Marketing yourself through social media is very restricted and don't want images, or videos to be portrayed in the wrong light. \r\n-Management across the board in multiple departments with no real life experiences\r\n-No discount on the purchase of a their vehicles, only on lease programs which if you live in state that offers state incentives they would waive the sales tax which there is no savings. \r\n-Dress code from HQ doesn't match to what is actually expected in each store. \r\n-No 401k match"}, {"review_title": "Great Time", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Nov 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay and worked with some amazing people.

It's exciting to be a part of Tesla Motors at first, because who doesn't want to work for Tesla Motors right? \r\n\r\nThere are many cons to consider when working in the sales/retail line of Tesla Motors. This isn't just my perspective, simply Google Tesla Motor's employee retention rate and let the numbers speak for itself. First of, there is zero work life balance. Part time employees work 35-40 hours a week without health benefits. Time slots between October-December Floating Time Off and Paid Time off are blocked off, causing additional stress for employees who have families from out of the states/country, or want to utilize their Floating Time Off before it restarts at the beginning of the year. \r\n\r\nSome managers are hired from the retail industry without any expertise in car sales which causes the team to sink because their answer to every team member's question is \"I don't know.\" Not only do they not know the answer to a problem, they also fail to obtain additional phone/email contacts of skilled professionals who can help answer difficult leasing and financing questions for their team. Long story short, there is no leadership and guidance. In other words, employees are not equipped with the right tools to set them up for success, even if they take it upon themselves to learn from outside sources. \r\n\r\nLastly, if you've been at Tesla Motors for a while (1+ year), you'll start noticing that rarely, does anyone get promoted from within. I've seen many people who were \"promised\" a promotion for their hard work and seniority within the company, but sadly, every single hire for that same non-entry level position would get hired from outside. The most mind blowing aspect of HR and upper management recruitment is the fact that the new hires for the non-entry level automotive sales position fail to posses ANY prior automotive experience, neither do they have expertise on how Model S or Model X functions.\r\n\r\nIf you want growth and leadership, I'm sure positions in Northern California will be a better opportunity within Tesla."}, {"review_title": "Inspiring but lots of Growing Pains", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Order Operations in Amsterdam", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fast-paced and exciting environment.

You better hit their arbitrary goals or you\u2019re a terrible employee. \r\n2.) False promises. You will be promised $400k a year. What that means is you\u2019re actually going to make $30k year. If you want $70k a year, you better be willing to work 90 hours a week. In Tesla\u2019s eyes, you work for what you bring home.

You might bring home $70k for devoting your life to a bunch of Solarcity managers that barely made it out of high school but were strong at deceiving people in door to door sales.

What they are doing is making you feel good about your background and how you\u2019ll be awesome at Tesla. What really happens is they don\u2019t care. The carrots are there to make you feel good about making  ~$5 an hour only to be criticized because you couldn\u2019t make someone commit to a $50k solar install the first time you met with them. Nine times out of 10, if one makes a commitment on the first visit...they decide to cancel. Tesla holds you accountable if your customers don\u2019t commit on the first visit.  \r\n4.) Forced to break the law: Tesla encourages their employees to get a customer signature on a legally binding document. What the customer doesn\u2019t know is there is a box where the document is supposed to be notarized.

So it doesn\u2019t matter what ACTUALLY happens to a customer, just make sure you call enough people in a day. \n\nNo improvement - Management and neighboring departments ask what they can improve, when agents respond and actually give examples in which such changes would apply, the answers are always \u201cNo\u201d and/or \u201cthat doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d - which only shows the disconnect from all departments. No one listens to anyone. How are we supposed to work together when we can\u2019t even get along ourselves?\n\nYou\u2019re punished for wanting more - You can\u2019t simply ask for improvements, and/or FIGHT for what a customer needs (not even above and beyond, literally requesting the minimum requirements in order for a solar project to go forward.) is a battle EVERYTIME. You have to almost harass to the point of exhaustion. \n\nOver worked - I can list off every department that is insanely understaffed, but to be transparent I\u2019ll list examples in which we\u2019re severely lacking:\n - It is taking 3+ months to get a piece of paper from another department (inspections) to move a customers account. It has literally been stuck. I have looped in my, and their management countless times, in person and email without any response or a sign of help or concern. \n - The utility relations team has dropped the ball so many times its expected. It\u2019s an entry job with little to no training, they never submit applications correct or complete, and when you call them out or tell them so they can resubmit soon (Because by this point the application has already been submitted 8weeks) they usually bark at you and tell you not to contact them directly - but rather to email their queue team that 1) Doesn\u2019t exist anymore 2) They are not the agents who submit anyways, they do not know how to correct applications. When they attempt it\u2019s just rubbing salt in the wound.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency - Management says this all the time, but trust me they\u2019re so disconnected they couldn\u2019t even tell you how to do the job you\u2019re working under for. They ask you call as many people you can in a day and send as many emails as you can but the second you find a flaw on a project they blame you and tell you to figure it out. There are countless times I\u2019ve had to loop in 10-20 people on an issue and panic everyday for a week for someone to understand there is a need higher than what u can provide. Customer experience is ruined because no one cares. The application teams are infamous for playing golf in the middle of the office, while they\u2019re taking 7-9 business days to acknowledge and email you sent requesting they correct the applications that they submitted incorrectly\n\nYou\u2019re constantly in negative and upsetting settings - Management holds weekly meetings and all they do for 30 mins is give the third degree on how dissatisfied they are and how awful you and your team are, while reminding you, you are only showing other people why we do not need to exist. Don\u2019t worry though, when we ask management to allow the improvements to do better they simply say \u201cFigure that out yourself\u201d and/or \u201cNo.\u201d And laugh. Not only that, Sales Support Specialists are held to a much more burning quality standard than anyone else AKA when the application team takes 4 weeks to notice a rejection (that I do not have access to.) because they\u2019re playing golf, I will be the agent to be yelled at not only by the sales rep and the customer, but by management because I must be stupid to if not known.\n\nNo one will tell you how to improve but they all remind you you suck. - they have a spreadsheet that talks about your reviews, standard \u201cRed, yellow, green.\u201d Ranking. They almost always give you red and yellow and will never tell you why. Myself and multiple agents have asked for more information and more insight in this grading and they just don\u2019t give it to us. Good old \u201cyeah soon.\u201d.. \u201csoon\u201d has been months. But they continue to mark good jobs as red, reminding you you suck, but uh.. offer no help to improve.\n\nThis is the most backwards and negative place I\u2019ve ever been. Everyday is tough and I am happy to be leaving. The solar side will not survive long.\n\nElon always sends emails about his precious cars.. what about those PWs Elon?
