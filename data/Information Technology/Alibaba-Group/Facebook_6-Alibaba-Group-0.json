I'm pretty sure upper leadership would agree to this point behind closed doors, as they are obviously kowtowing to HQ as they spend their days in endless meetings, pretending to have any actual clout in the greater organization. It must kill them inside, but they get paid enough to be okay with indefinitely being a cog. \r\n\r\nBesides the lack of heed paid to \"local\" hires, I have never seen a company with such a near-criminal disregard for its customers despite claiming to be \"customer first.\" I witnessed countless instances of negligence and fraud without there ultimately being any accountability for those culpable. Escalation of such issues was clearly unwelcome, as that would involve a disproportionate amount of work up the chain of command to address what would never have occurred were there a functional resolution process to begin with. \r\n\r\nThis is a bureaucratic nightmare of a corporate culture, complete with top-down \"command and control\" and endless layers of nebulous middle management who care little for their reports and are desperate to game their KPIs for promotion. If it's not attached to an already decided-upon KPI, it may as well not exist, as evinced by a customer experience that is qualitatively awful, because leadership is happy as long as the revenue numbers keep going up. This myopic approach fails to consider how much growth potential is still goes wasted, but this is a place that is all about blind cheerleading and shuns meaningful critique or dissent. All tropes of hypocrisy with regard to a company's stated values are at play here.\r\n\r\nOne of my most trenchant and instructive memories during my time at Alibaba was at the goodbye drinks for a bright, talented colleague who had worked there for years. Once most people had filtered out, she began to cry, because no matter how hard they worked, and after all those years of their life, almost nothing they did ended up making a difference to the product or company. \r\n\r\nThe main takeaway I had working here is that you can take away a solid paycheck, but you have to be okay with having almost no real impact. If you want to go the established-company route, I would advise advise that you save yourself some time and frustration you work to get into a Western company."}, {"review_title": "Nice Company in before", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Marketing Director in Beijing, Beijing", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "big group and nice history", "cons": "too slow and not flexible enough"}, {"review_title": "Ali culture", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Apr 2021", "job_title": "BDM Manager in Hong Kong", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "a big company to work for with a good package and benefits", "cons": "Thats a 996 China work style and very top-down style with a strong china centralisation .
