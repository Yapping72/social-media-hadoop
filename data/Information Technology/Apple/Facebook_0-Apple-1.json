Don\u2019t work here. Not much good here.", "cons": "worked as an annotation analyst from the creation of the AIML department in late 2019 until 2022. In the Lavits Quay office in Cork city centre. The job in short was to listen and transcribe audio taken by Siri. And to analyse the response of Siri to the user. This role in my opinion is completely mind numbing click work. It is the same task every day listening and transcribing short audio snippets in the thousands every day. and doing a few niche side projects at the side which are equally as tedious. The job was pretty ok and relaxed at the start in 2019 when the department was in its early stages. As time went by more emphasis was put on hitting KPIs which solely just measure keystrokes and mouse movements which now require constant attention to meet the targets. People have left this role over constant harassment and micromanagement over KPIs. People are constantly micromanaged and management is always thinking of ways to further oversee employees. The starting salary is quite poor for Cork. Working in what\u2019s supposed to be the richest multinational in the world. Pay increases are quite low too. Expect to barely make the rate of inflation. Shares which take years to cash out are sometimes given. But In small amounts. The benefits aren\u2019t bad. But aren\u2019t any better than any other multinational. Wfh is uncompetitive as this role requires you to be in the office three days a week. Other companies offering more working from home options. The office culture can only be described as cult like. If any issue is brought to the attention of management it\u2019s always shrugged of as \u201cbut you work for Apple. Be glad for that\u201d You are constantly forced to take part in corporate cringe activities. Treated like adult children by management. There is close to no career progression in this role. As most promotions are given to friends of friends. Management shifts their responsibilities onto analysts by creating new roles with added tasks with no additional pay. In summary. This job may be tempting for a recent graduate. But I\u2019d still stay away. As the work itself is soul destroying and benefits aren\u2019t much better than a normal multinational without all the cons."}, {"review_title": "No balance", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Technical Advisor in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay Bonuses vacation days", "cons": "no work-life balance multiple managers no community feeling"}, {"review_title": "great pay", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Sales Advisor in Glasgow, Scotland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good pay,, and good culture", "cons": "long hours and hard job"}, {"review_title": "Amazing", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Penetration Tester in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very nice good amazing pay", "cons": "They won't let me drive the Apple car"}], [{"review_title": "Good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Senior Sofyware Engineer in Dhaka", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good to work in apple company", "cons": "nothing to say like that"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "20 Feb 2023", "job_title": "People Team in Boise, ID", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of opportunity at apple", "cons": "Nothing bad to report here"}, {"review_title": "Good company to work for for a short term or really long term", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Sales Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits for full-timers and if you start young enough and save your stock, you can afford a down payment on a house.", "cons": "It\u2019s tough to get to the long term benefits.

I know not everyone will be your friend but some respect and responsiveness would be appreciated. I never experienced this in any workplace with more mature co-workers. \r\nThe work-life balance is not the best specially for young moms on a part time basis where you have to work minimum 4x week and hardly ever you get a weekend off.

Benefits One of the most attractive attributes of working at an Apple store is the great employee benefits they provide. They offer a comprehensive healthcare package that pays for medical-related expenses and preventative care. The healthcare plan Apple utilizes is one of the best in the industry and allows employees to get medical attention to prevent certain conditions and maintain those chronic conditions. Apple also offers its employees other benefits such as financial perks and savings options to help pay for retirement, future expenses, and plan for any major purchases. 2. Rewarding Working at an Apple Store can be rewarding for many employees. Various duties include helping individuals solve problems or purchasing the right products for their particular needs. It can be a very positive experience to cultivate customer relationships over time and ensure that each person gets the best service and assistance. Some instances can include retrieving lost information, transferring phones, and electronic details, assisting with purchases, etc. 3. Challenging Unlike many other technology and retail-related jobs, Apple store jobs can be challenging and provide an environment that encourages growth and learning. Many retail jobs can become tedious and monotonous for workers and pose little to no challenge. However, working at an Apple Store, there is always a new challenge to assist customers and something new to learn almost daily. It is a great way to stay engaged with work and look forward to solving issues for customers along the way. 4. Diversity The Apple Store is a business that prides itself on diversity. They hire from various backgrounds and cultures to ensure a complete representation of society and actively select the best candidates based on their previous education and experience in the industry. That means that truly qualified people usually land the job. Anyone who values diversity in hiring and working in a multicultural environment will enjoy working at one of the Apple Store locations worldwide. 5. Education People who work at the Apple Store can get continuous education related to the latest products and technological applications for Apple-related devices. Additionally, Apple ensures their employees at the Apple store stay up-to-date on the latest techniques and information related to sales, service, and maintenance. Individuals who like to learn and stay on the cutting edge of technology will get great satisfaction working in an environment where continuous education related to Apple products is promoted and expected. 6. Resume Whether an Apple Store employee decides to stay in their position permanently, having a job with an Apple store always looks great on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. This is especially true for individuals who want to keep in a technology-related field. Employees of the Apple store are required to learn many different skills, and other employers know that individuals selected to work with Apple are likely to have a wide and varied skill set that is an asset to just about any company. 7. Upward Mobility Those who choose to take a position with an Apple store at an entry level can look forward to the possibility of promotion in management and a relatively short time. One of the great perks of working at an Apple Store is moving into management after a certain timeframe. Management positions offer competitive salaries and the ability to create stability. There are usually plenty of management positions available within an area. Apple does not solely hire from within, so there may be the opportunity to work beginning at the management level if the applicant has adequate credentials and experience. 8. Work in Any City There are Apple Stores in almost every city across the country. That means that individuals can work at an Apple Store in just about any place they choose. If you start at a particular Apple Store and want to move, there is always the opportunity to transfer to a store near the new location. That offers greater flexibility and the ability to travel to other locations if desired. Employees may also want to transfer to another location for management opportunities.", "cons": "1. Long Hours Many Apple store employees have reported that the Apple store expects them to work long hours. Many employees at Apple stores report excessive overtime hours and issues with time off during certain holidays. Unlike many other technology companies, the Apple store tends its employees to wear clothes that require them to work long hours to complete. While this may mean significant pay for workers, it can also be the source of employee burnout after a time. 2. No Work/Life Balance Employees of the Apple Store have consistently argued that it is difficult to maintain a good work/life balance at the Apple Store. The long hours and fluctuating schedule may mean working the majority of days off at times and dealing with erratic schedules at times. There is no guarantee of time requests being granted for family events, vacation, or sick leave. That means employees must be prepared to work more than the average industry employee, especially during the busy times of the year. 3. Challenging to Stand Out It can be very difficult to stand out from other employees at the Apple Store. The work is fairly standard and does not leave much room for employees to really shine. In order to get a promotion to management, the employee must adhere to all the company\u2019s standards and perform consistently rather than stand out on their own merits. This can be a negative point for some who wish to stand out via their outstanding performances. 4. Too Many Managers The possibility of promotion of management is a benefit of working at the Apple Store, but the excessive number of managers at any one location can also be a downside. Many Apple store employees report they felt too many management positions were available within the company and specific locations. Individuals hoping to manage a store may find fewer opportunities and less prominent than standard management positions at any Apple Store location. 5. Too Much Work There is a great deal of work for employees who work at an Apple Store. Since Apple is one of the most popular electronic brands on the market, there are always many customer issues to address. That can mean longer than average hours and having to go the extra mile. 6. Not Enough Time Off Along with the potentially excessive workloads and long hours comes limited time off. This is especially true for those employees who fill management roles. Managers are expected to work when needed and may not always get the standard two days off per week. Additionally, workloads vary according to season and need. 7. Difficult Customers Working with difficult customers is always a con of any retail job. However, working with electronics in a major electronics retailer may mean putting up with more than the average number of difficult customers. Having a cool demeanor and level head is extremely important for those working at an Apple Store."}, {"review_title": "Looks good on the outside but think again once you get an offer.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Technical Specialist in Seoul", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "No extra work after the shift", "cons": "No opinion is valued although the company says that they do.

I worked for this company for many years and witnessed first hand an insane amount of favoritism across various markets. - Men specifically are approached with role opportunities they otherwise didn\u2019t express interest in. - The benefits package is outstanding and is absolutely required because after a few months to a year and a half you begin to feel worn down. This feeling doesn\u2019t go away until you separate from the company, voluntarily or otherwise. - Management does a really good job at putting on a persona of cultivating an enriching and inviting environment that is ultimately used against you. If you ask questions you\u2019re labeled as insubordinate and this will be reflected in your review, further effecting your wages. This \u2018pushback\u2019 is also used against you when you desire to grow within the company. - Transferring from retail to corporate is insanely difficult for reasons that are still unclear to me and remain a mystery to many colleagues. - The company emphasizes the importance of exchange journals and owning your journey however, leadership continuously fails to respect the time scheduled for your development, if it\u2019s scheduled at all. Their argument is that we\u2019re there to meet business needs. Once that card is dealt your personal development doesn\u2019t matter. - Training is also almost nonexistent beyond the core week(s). They will schedule time for compliance training as it\u2019s required by law but even then due to business needs and the impact it has on the company image anyone spending time off of the floor is reprimanded. - There\u2019s a significant amount of micromanaging if you\u2019re not vocal about this. Unfortunately, many of my colleagues do the bare minimum which calls for more feedback than you wish to give and also sheds a new light on why leadership micromanages. - Positions in the retail space are exactly that \u201cretail\u201d and \u201ccustomer service\u201d there\u2019s frequent discussions about how your job impacts people and technology. However, the reality is that there\u2019s a SIGNIFICANT disconnect between the world of technology and your role during your time at Apple. You\u2019re not learning new processes and terminology that translates to any position in the tech industry. It\u2019s easy to get lost in the company culture which in hindsight will translate to you becoming increasingly comfortable with the bare minimum provided. It\u2019s important that you put your foot down with your training and development and also do the work on the outside if technology is a space you want to grow in. The only valuable certification is a Genius certification and even then you will be required to study for and taking certifications outside of Apple if you want to grow in the tech space. Apple is NOT tech focused in the retail space. Do not allow the image to cloud that reality. - There are significant pay gaps between each individual and role. Often this is defended by stating a role is a lateral move however the responsibilities often aren\u2019t lateral. Because a leaders perception of you is so heavily weighed in your reviews this impacts your wage increases. This circles back to favoritism. A leader who favors one person will ensure to write a review reflecting this thus justifying the max pay increase where as penny\u2019s are given to someone they view as a challenge. - The culture being so inviting it\u2019s also easy to confuse professional relationships with friendships. You will meet incredible people throughout your journey. However, please understand that your colleagues are not your friends and it\u2019s okay to emphasize this in your day-to-days. There is a fine line in sharing in work experiences and discussing work related topics and sharing your personal experiences. You\u2019re not required to be an open book and it\u2019s difficult to feel like you don\u2019t have to be one because of the company culture and the pressure to be people focused. You can 100% be people centric without divulging any aspect of your personal life. - Work / Life balance only exists if you let it. There\u2019s only ever been one leader in my many years of service that saw me working overtime and cared about how it impacted me and not the company\u2019s pockets. In hindsight overtime isn\u2019t necessarily an issue depending on your store\u2019s performance. They\u2019d rather have you stay and finish a task than hand it off hence why little is said unless the store isn\u2019t performing well and lacks overtime flexibility. You\u2019ll hear this conversation increase depending on the quarter. - There\u2019s a lack of transparency across the company especially when it comes to wages, specifically leadership wages. The leadership team is incentivized with bonuses that 100% depend on your performance. Leadership compensation isn\u2019t discussed at all across the company. Doors are kept closed for a reason and another reason is because they discuss employee matters as a collective. Whether these conversations are professional or not will depend on that specific leader. - All in all you won\u2019t realize how suffocating it all is until you separate from the company. You won\u2019t understand why you\u2019re unhappy during your time there until you separate and realize the lack of growth and mismanaged opportunities."}, {"review_title": "Could be better, could be worse", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Apple is a fun place to work.
