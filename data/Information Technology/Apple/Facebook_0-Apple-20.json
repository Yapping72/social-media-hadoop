This lab has a reputation of treating onsite vendors unethically. You are nothing to Apple employee team. The lab wants you to realize that you are not an Apple employee nor contractor. You are just a vendor.\r\n\r\nThe lab hired someone from a restaurant to manage the lab. The lab has many demeaning rules including the prohibition of walking too close to Globalization director\u2019s office inside or outside the building. \r\n\r\nBelow are some of their rules:\r\n\r\n- The lab protects Apple employee team. Even though you are right and they are wrong, You are nothing to the lab - you will be terminated the next day. \r\n- Cell phones are not allowed inside or outside the lab. If you want to make a phone call or text, walk away to other buildings.\r\n- Paid by the hour and hours change all the time, unstable income.\r\n- No Perks at all.\r\n- No Bus service and no mileage reimbursement. \r\n- You are allowed to take a 15 min break to do whatever you want, but you can't have breakfast because it gives the lab staff a bad impression that you are hired to work but not have a little breakfast in your own free time.\r\n- You have to come to work on time but you can\u2019t wait or hang around outside the building. You have to wait in your car waiting for the Lab door to open. It is terrible for a pregnant tester like me. Sometimes, I have to wait in a hot car.\r\n- The lab threatens if you loose your badge, you will get terminated.\r\n- Can\u2019t pick up any complimentary fruits or drinks in the refrigerator. They would rather see those fruits spoil than share with you because you are not an Apple employee.\r\n- Your work screen is monitored and viewed by lab staffs all the time. The lab uses this fact as a means of intimidating and taunting vendor staff.\r\n- You can\u2019t even post \u201consite at Apple inc\u201d on Linkedin or any other websites.
