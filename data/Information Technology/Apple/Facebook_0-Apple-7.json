Additionally, the KPI were used as a weapon in ratings. Using numbers and reviews that were out of my control to determine my quarterly and annual review \u201cscore\u201d never felt like a way to learn what to improve upon. Constantly asking what I can do to improve in order to get promotions or raises fell on deaf ears, although my Team Manager referred to me as a RockStar. For such a valuable company, they didn\u2019t really pay that well. In my six years I went from $14/hr to just over $20/hr but it was extremely hard fought/won and I was left to myself if I were to have any success. ZERO mentorship offered - little more than words offered by direct management. They don\u2019t really care about you as a person. Oh, and if you want to succeed at Apple I was told by a \u2018successful\u2019 employee that you can\u2019t have a life outside of Apple.
