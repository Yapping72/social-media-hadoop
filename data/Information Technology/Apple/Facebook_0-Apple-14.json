This leads to some employees cheating by giving credit for sales that didn't meet any metrics to house instead of their own name.

It didn't matter seem to matter if you worked really hard, did a good job and pleased your customers if you didn't always hit the required metrics (which were often arbitrary and based on things you had no influence over).

When it was offered to me, it was referred to as an entry-level position, yet it is a position that those who start as specialists are promoted to.  The work is backbreaking, requiring a significant deal of knowledge and an ability to take abuse from customers.  You don't get to just chat with customers about cool speaker systems.  You have to deliver the bad news.  You have to be able to deal with pissed of customers,  work quickly, be creative and sharp.  It's a huge step up from the specialist position, and although it requires only a tenth of the technical skill required to be Genius, it requires just as strong an ability to work with angry, upset and confused customers with broken tech.  Yet you make less than half of what some of the geniuses make."}, {"review_title": "Great teams, stressful atmosphere, okay-ish pay", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Retail Sales Associate in Southlake, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The biggest pro to working at Apple is the people who work there.
