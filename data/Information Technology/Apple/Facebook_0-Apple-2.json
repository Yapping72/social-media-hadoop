The worst part about these customers is that they get sent a survey to rate you. If you get bad reviews, management will come to talk to you. \n\nOn Christmas Eve, I once had a customer shove a watch band in my face and not say anything. No questions, no request to buy it, they just expected me to read their mind (I'm supposed to fix the phones too, not sell merchandise). I did it anyway so they wouldn't have to wait awhile.

Getting promoted/role change is hard work but would pay off well for those looking to lead their team. Many options available for those looking for a career experience at the corporate level after being successful in your current role.\n\n-Great loyalty to and from their employees, although sometimes this means we just 'do whatever corporate thinks we should'. During store closures amid the pandemic apple had all of us work our full hours remotely on collaboration and individual and group projects, great to see them take care of us like that compared to many other retail spaces.\n\n-Genuine joy from helping others often at no cost (depending on hardware/software issue) and repairing trust in Apple's products and services. A personal passion of mine.\n\n-Some new minor benefits and lower schedule requirements for employees coming soon (mostly in response to work life balance issues, see below).", "cons": "-Overall direction of new leadership and management. Prioritization of metrics and statistics. Although these stats were always important (they are factored in to determine pay increases), I've noticed newer leadership change how they treat different employees over small changes or minor trends in sales metrics (Applecare,trade-in, accessories,connected).\n\n-Work-life balance is not well for a full-time role. Hours are long and can be tedious, working long is expected and rewarded. For college students, I would've recommended a part time role, but even then the schedule inconsistency and still high commitment would only be for those who can effectively balance the two as equal. I was burnt out and ready for something new after about 2-1/2 years, many will stay for years, some decades.\n\n-You are taught that the Apple experience is about doing what's right for the customer, within the boundaries of what's possible for the company. Often, even a straightforward and legitimate solution (the one our service guide recommends) involves jumping through many hoops to get the customer,leadership,and system to all agree. As a starting specialist, you are the professional hoops jumper, especially at the genius bar.\n\n-Consistent issues with in-store software and hardware, internal tools and services going down, loss of written notes and repair details. Service blackouts are usually minutes but can sometimes last for hours. Daily re-write ups of unsaved repairs or broken repair chains. Extreme lack of production due to these problems, usually amplified by the higher amount of customers we saw at our smaller and less employed store.\n\nSlight anti-union attitude, but no outright call against them. We saw other large stores in cities unionize, I know some of my fellow employees weren't opposed to the idea given the dissent from work-life balance."}, {"review_title": "Great company, no 100% remote options", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "27 Sept 2022", "job_title": "3D Artist in Sunnyvale, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working with some the most talented artist on some on the newest tech!", "cons": "No 100% remote options, so you're left having to live in the expensive Bay Area."}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Retail Sales Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Iphone is a cool product and the store always looks nice", "cons": "It's still a retail job and customers are annoying"}, {"review_title": "Great Job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Tier 1 IOS Advisor in Tallahassee, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "compensation and work-life balance.

I believe that as long as you're meeting deadlines, contributing to your team and doing impactful work, it doesn't matter how or where you do it. Apple needs to trust their employees more. \n\nThe benefits are alright. The cafeteria food is marked down by maybe 10% and isn't very good so we often get lunch from the Whole Foods hot bar.

Many employees talk trash about other companies as if everyone is the enemy. This was off-putting when I first joined and during my first 1:1 meetings with multiple people including my own manager, my previous company became a topic for slander.
