So, do your homework on the group you are joining (stay away from IS&T). \r\n\r\nLastly, telling people you work at Apple always gets a lot of attention - the brand recognition is amazing.", "cons": "As with any company, there are parts of it that are amazing, and then parts that are not as amazing. IS&T falls in the 'not so amazing' category. Employee development is mediocre at best, pay is lacking and the charm of stock is elusive.  There are a lot of fiefdoms, a lot of obscure politics, and parts of the organization lack the Apple culture that you would expect or hear while on the outside. A director, having come from another bay area company, had hired others within management from the same bay area company. There seemed to be quite a bit of favoritism within this clique - didn't look like people moved up the ladder if they weren't a part of the clique. \r\n\r\nWorking from home is generally frowned upon and discouraged. The occasional working from home is ok but the expectatation is that you are in the office  (why else would you build a multi-billion dollar HQ?). \r\n\r\nIS&T heavily relies on outsourced vendors to do the heavy lifting and this can grow frustrating as you spend most of your time interacting with non-Apple employees. As a result of this, the diversity is lacking and there is an endless line of replaceable Indian resources. It's very impersonal at times - if you don't like one of them, pick another, like a box of infinite tissues. Constantly working with replaceable resources prevents one from developing any meaningful working relationships. There are stretches where you hardly interact with other 'badged' Apple employees. Many in management have moved over to Apple from one of these vendors, and bring with them a different work culture which at times takes away from the Apple culture. Apparently, it's ok for customers to email Tim Cook, or Steve Jobs when he was around, but god forbid that an employee emails an executives admin (not even an executive, but their admin) inquiring about the most benign of things. Hell shall break loose, and you will forever be marked as \"that guy\". All of a sudden, the backside of the fence doesn't seem to be painted as nicely as the front side. \r\n\r\nPerformance reviews are an absolute joke. If you are too technical and lack the business/management aspects they will tell you that you need to grow your business acumen and management capabilities. If your strengths are management but you lack technical skills, they will tell you that you need to strengthen your technical skills.  Needless to say, there is next to no process in place, or employee development to help you grow in whatever area they think you need focus on. This is just a tactic - draw attention to your weaknesses then provide no means to improve them, thus justifying your paltry merit increase. While you are told you will get a bonus, additional stock - if you aren't in the right group or have the right 'people managers' batting for you, you are screwed. Many in management have no business being managers as they do absolutely nothing to help those under them grow professionally.  At the end of the day, it's an attitude of 'be grateful, you work for Apple'...unfortunately, this just isn't enough justification to stick around long term for some. \r\n\r\nIS&T also has this extremely poor and chaotic funding process for capital projects. It may have worked very smoothly when Apple was much smaller, but it does not scale well at all and creates absolute mayhem. It's a process that begs the need for a six sigma type approach to correct it, or get a bunch of consultants (real consultants, not offshore) in there to help streamline it. Many of the challenges they face, such as a diluted culture resulting from an overabundance of offshore resources can be directly attributed to a poor planning and funding process. Also, projects that are deemed 'sexy' are the ones that get approved, the ones that are on senior managements presentations, and the ones that you have to be a part of to really get any recognition. If you are on an 'operational' project', even those that are business critical, and it's not a 'sexy' project - you will more than likely be sidelined when it comes to merit increases/performance reviews."}, {"review_title": "May vary from store to store", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Mar 2014", "job_title": "Specialist in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "opportunity to work with amazing, talented people.  great opportunities on discounts applicable to third party accessories.  access to stock options, software, discounts on apple products, health benefits and more.  lots of focus on training and time to meet with managers to discuss your goals.", "cons": "poor work-life balance.  retail hours are all over the map.  our store focused primarily on attachments- one to one memberships and applecare.  it created an incredibly negative environment for anyone working in sales and took competition out of the friendly zone.  it was pretty much impossible to move up without sipping the kool-aid and racking up a good attachment rate.

I've heard this numerous times from people everywhere in Apple, so this is not a local culture thing in my department; and as you would expect, a lot of time is wasted that way, either on trying to figure something out for days that could have been explained in 30 seconds, or achieving entire pieces of work that have already been done by other people before, but no one told you even if you asked.

It is upsetting to receive a bad survey over an issue that you did not cause or have no control over, especially when you did everything possible to correct the problem. \r\n\r\nThe surveys and other other performance metrics are used to decide priority when bidding for schedules.

We are also not given much information in regards to any \"known issues\" or bugs in the software.

Furthermore, there are many very smart and dedicated people working alongside you that make the job enjoyable on a day to day basis.  Apple typically makes the right choices when it comes to advancements/promotions.  Apple is competitive when it comes to compensation.  They typically aim to be better in this area than many other companies.  It's easy to get behind a company like Apple who is continually releasing innovative products.  The positive aspects of working for Apple are almost too numerous to list here.", "cons": "The negative aspect at Apple is its growth.    Apple, in some ways, has grown to become the behemoth company it stood against in its infancy.  Apple is, on its surface, an incredible place to work, but Apple is struggling with becoming a giant corporation like any other thriving tech company.  It would be difficult to explain without proper context.  I'll share some of my personal experience.\r\n\r\nI worked at Apple's corporate campus between four and five years.  I excelled in every role I was placed and was quickly promoted through several different groups during my tenure.  I was chosen for my last promotion at Apple over at least 250 other applicants.  This promotion was on a 'technical path' while I was being groomed for a path in management.  I accepted a position in Apple's 'engineering group' over pursuing a management role.  This was considered a extremely desirable promotion and a reflection of my hard work.\r\n\r\nI excelled in this role as well.  I had worked approx. three months in this group before I was taken into an office to be interrogated by Apple's HR group.  They explained I had become the subject of HR complaint.  This was the first time I had ever had any interaction with HR or been the subject of any disciplinary action whatsoever in my entire tenure as an Apple employee.  \r\n\r\nApple's HR group made the decision to terminate my employment over their interpretation of Apple's business conduct policies regarding tobacco and 'electronic cigarette' use.  I was assured by my management team that the decision was made entirely by Apple's HR group.  In other words, my management team was not consulted and this had nothing to do with my performance at work.  I was urged to appeal the decision by virtually every manager and peer I had at Apple.  \r\n\r\nThe decision/interpretation that led to my termination also led to a series of meetings to clarify Apple's policies on this subject.  Numerous employees at Apple Inc. use personal vaporizers or 'electronic cigarettes' as smoking cessation devices.  Naturally, my termination led to fairly serious questions about HR's interpretation of 'tobacco use' and 'personal vaporizer' use.  HR's own support could not give a singular answer on this subject, so management had to demand clarification on what the policy actually states before any one else was terminated on the same grounds.  The understanding being that if I was somehow guilty of violating Apple's policies so were many other people working on that campus at that time.  \r\n\r\nDuring my appeal, HR stated that the clarifications made to the policies regarding this subject did not apply to my termination because they were made the day after my termination.  This ignored the fact that the decision to terminate my employment with Apple was directly responsible for the push for management to seek that very clarification.  Furthermore, it was verified by my co-workers that I was never a part of the conversation that was originally cited in the complaint to HR in the first place.  In fact, I had never met or spoke with the person who originally made the complaint to begin with.  Finally, HR's representative who handled my appeal made several statements that indicated she did not have a fundamental understanding of the events or policies that led to my termination.  This being the result of two months of 'research' she claimed she was doing on my appeal's case.  I feel it's also important to note that the group that made this decision also resides in California.  It's likely they had never stepped foot on our campus.\r\n\r\nI hope this illustrates the issue well enough.  This is the kind of corporate behavior you would expect to find in a Terry Gilliam film or a Franz Kafka novel.  This is not the behavior I expected from a company that I was fiercely loyal to and loved working at.  I can't help shake the feeling that somebody was 'making their numbers' when it came to my case.\r\n\r\nIt's a more than a little ironic that Apple would have such archaic policies regarding the use of personal vaporizers given the nature of their business and interests in health devices.\r\n\r\nThe experience of working for the company is exemplary.  It is everything you would expect working for a company that is dedicated to releasing innovative products that have a huge impact on the way people live their lives.  \r\n\r\nHowever, if HR's gaze falls upon you no one at Apple can save your career from the faults in their interpretations.\r\n\r\nTim Cook could probably stop this from happening.  He didn't respond to my emails."}, {"review_title": "Give them your life.

You can't work at a Tier 1 Silicon Valley tech company and expect 9-5 / M-F. What I don't like:  Food is not free like Google, and not as good as Google. However they give engineers a $12/day dinner voucher. That is enough at the slightly-subsidized cafeterias to purchase enough for dinner and the next day's lunch, so it's almost like free food.

First I should say, I LIKE Apple products and own one or two. That being said, the culture at Apple feels like a professional cult. There is a definite feeling of being watched... all of the time, and then being \"corrected\" whenever you think the wrong way. \r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n-Chats being monitored - any negative statements are immediately addressed by a manager you were not even talking to. (e.g. saying in a chat \"I am pissed that I am not allowed to request Christmas off\" will be followed by a manager messaging you and saying \"Let's remember to keep things positive!\")\r\n-Your call/phone status is always on a timer.. including going \"idle\" (which is what you have to do if you need to go to the bathroom or something so you don't miss a call) and if you are idle for more than 3 minutes.. well you be contacted by the manager monitoring you that day.\r\n-Your issued iMac is setup to allow a manager to view your screen at any time without notification to you, so you never know when they are looking at your screen. \r\n-Recorded calls\r\n-Constant feeling of secrets you cannot know, like being assigned new managers every 2-3 months, or having teams broken up and re-assigned for not obvious reason. \r\n\r\nThe list gets longer and shorter depending on who your manager is.. some are really invasive and some are really laid back. \r\n\r\nSome other more general cons are:\r\n-little to no flexibility in schedule, it is basically a lottery on what schedule you get and your requests or availability have no way of being addressed. I asked about moving my schedule to accommodate a single college class and I was told there was no way to do that because they \"do not control the scheduling\".\r\n-no break in calls for entirety of shift and no ability to walk away from your at-home desk. \r\n-Working holidays is required, they actually have a vacation \"blackout\" period that covers the Thanksgiving to Christmas to New Year's period where you are not even allowed to request vacation. \r\n-Only robotic ways of evaluating performance and being rewarded for good performance so if you are doing well, but the simplistic metric system is unable to analyze that.. then you are not doing well and no further opportunities will be presented to you. \r\n-Troubleshooting and resolving issues comes last in priorities, with priorities being to keep calls under 15 minutes and manipulate customers into \"feeling\" like they have been helped.. whether you actually solved a problem for them or not. \r\n\r\nI actually think in this position, it is somewhat of a necessary evil, because they are ensuring no time is wasted. With as many employees as they have doing this and for the pay they receive.. it is a requirement to ensure that people aren't just slacking off under no supervision in this at-home environment.

'All that glitters is not gold'; 'The grass isn't always greener on the other side'.  These are a few sayings that come to mind when people say they want to work for Apple.  If you work in Applecare, you are a call center worker.  No matter how they dress it up to you.  Chat, Email or Phones.  It's a call center, so comes with it the cons of working in a call center.\r\n\r\nShift Scheduling - Is absolutely abysmal.  Depending on your department, you'll have to change your schedule in a little as every 3 months or 6 months. So say goodbye to any obligations you have outside of work, because when a shift is assigned to you.  It's yours, and you have to work it.  Yes, they try to sugar coat and say you can swap with someone else, but if it's already a crazy shift to begin with, nobody else is going to want it.\r\n\r\nWork life Balance - Where? At the time of this writing you get no holidays off in Applecare (or weekends depending on your schedule).  When I first started, you did.  But now, nada.  365 days a year the queues are opened. However management (your manager) gets these days off (and weekends). How nice.\r\n\r\nWork tools - Will never work properly.  I've never worked at a company where there was so many issues with work tools.  The kicker is you'll still need to be able to assist the customers and expected to get awesome CSATs with non-working tools.  \r\n\r\nMicromanagement - You'll never do anything right.  If it's not one thing, it's another.  Your manager will find fault in anything that you do, it's expected.  Good calls or chats will still be nit picked and have endless \"one on ones\" on discussing how it could have been done better. They even have it written in policy on how long you are allowed to take bathroom breaks. Yep, even when you work from home.\r\n\r\nPolicy and Procedures - Can and will change without notice.You are told how to do something, you do it.  A few months later it's wrong and should never be done like that.  And when you ask why or when it was changed. No one can give you a straight answer.  They'll give you the typical 'Apple BS giving you an answer, but not really answering your question' answer (with a smile on their face).  Those that work in Applecare will know exactly what I'm referencing too.  \r\n\r\nFinal thoughts.  Management loves to \"cheerlead\" you through this muck of a work environment. They know what we have to go through isn't ideal and outright sucks, but they ignore it and speak to you like everything that is happening to you is good and we should be thankful for what Apple is doing for us. It's borderline \"cult like\". It's like serving you dog poop on a gold plate with gold utensils, and they try to convince you that it's good for you."}, {"review_title": "Worst Company I've ever worked for", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Home Advisor in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Cheap Apple products , working from home, no work commute  save on transportation costs due to no commuting to work , I can't think of anything else positive", "cons": "Micro managed, little room for advancement, split weekends without two consecutive days off,  poor interpersonal skills in management, off shore human resource"}, {"review_title": "Technical Advisor", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "21 May 2017", "job_title": "Technical Specialist in Sacramento, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Money, benefits are decent, small discount on stocks.

There was a strong community spirit and a willingness to help each other out. Working with the vast majority of my colleagues was a pleasure; I made many friends during my time with the company.\r\n\r\n2. The Genius role is split between seeing customers to diagnose their issues, and physically repairing Apple hardware. I found a great deal of satisfaction in both the problem-solving and customer relationship management elements of the job. Diagnosing and resolving issues within tight time frames kept a healthy pressure up and provided clear performance goals. There was good support from management for personal development within the role. The service strategy changed a lot during my time at Apple (less attention on individual customers in order to serve a greater number), but that was an unfortunate reality of the growing demand. I still enjoyed the day-to-day work right up until I left Apple for a new opportunity.\r\n\r\n3. Apple Retail has a young and diverse culture. Tattoos, bright hair and piercings are all completely acceptable among staff. Dress code was very relaxed... Wearing trainers every day and shorts in summer was bliss. \r\n\r\n4. Genius pay is very good for a job that does not formally require a degree. I worked for Apple for nearly three years and received three incremental annual pay rises, leaving on ~\u00a325k as a Genius with a year's experience in the role. Considerable discounts were available on Apple products for myself, friends and family. Apple employees received preferable rates in many of the local eateries and, most importantly, pubs.

I started off with Apple as a part-time sales advisor ('Specialist') and successive promotions happened quickly, but the Genius position sits in a comfortable little cul-de-sac thereafter. Geniuses in Apple Retail are remunerated well but cannot easily continue a technical career into Apple Corporate as there is often a qualifications barrier to entry. Perhaps understandably, Apple does not have a career pathway that allows Geniuses to train for Corporate roles in the absence of degrees in computer science, electronic engineering or similar.\r\nThe general consensus seemed to be that while there is no stigma attached to working for Apple Retail, it is held at arm's length from Corporate and aspirational talk from management about moving across as part of one's career path is largely lip-service. Multiple colleagues of mine had secondments to Corporate but were not offered permanent positions. My advice is that if you want a role within Apple as a wider organisation, it is better to gain more relevant experience elsewhere than get your foot in the door with Apple Retail.\r\n\r\n2.

Apple has an established reputation as compensating its employees well, and this is something that passes through pretty well through its vendors.

There also seem to be plenty of opportunities for overtime and extra hours.\r\n\r\n* Constant opportunities for advancement.  There always seems to be room for growth and development at Apple.  Its vendors are always looking for ways to move people up to the next level of support (Tier 2 / senior advisor) or in leadership positions.  The availability of these positions within Apple\u2019s vendors directly reflects on Apple\u2019s growth.  Apple\u2019s need for additional advisors/agents \u2013 and the leadership groups that support them \u2013 are clearly growing.  This is evidenced by concurrent aggressive hiring efforts from multiple vendors, including Concentrix, Arise Virtual Solutions, Teleperformance, Xerox, and Kelly Services.\r\n\r\n* Provides all necessary equipment for the job.  With other WAH lines of work, you often must provide your own computer and headset.  Apple ensures that its direct employees and vendors are provided with the equipment they need to do the job.  (In this case, this includes an iMac, keyboard, mouse, USB headset, phone system, and Ethernet cable.)  An exception to this is Arise Virtual Solutions, which requires its independent contractors to provide their own equipment.  (That\u2019s one of the qualities of an independent contractor.)  Beyond that, though, Apple seems dedicated to equipping its people for their roles.", "cons": "However, as anyone born in the last three decades might realize, Apple also does not lead the market in terms of operating system brand or affordability.  As a result, most prospective Apple employees (whether direct or through a vendor) need to have some degree of experience with their products before providing service to their customers, or it\u2019s going to be an uphill battle.\r\n\r\n* Inadequate training curriculum.  Now, I know what you might be thinking; this is where Apple\u2019s responsibility might be blurred with the vendor\u2019s responsibility, since the vendor \u2013 as a contractor \u2013 provides its own trainers and can make its own adaptations to the training process for its agents.  Nevertheless, Apple clearly intends for its vendors to use their proprietary training process (known as \u201cNew Advisor Training \u2013 Academy\u201d) inside a portal known as iDesk in order to complete the training process.\r\n\r\n--- It lasts several weeks, but the training itself involves very few simulations or interaction on the part of the student.  Most of the training consists of boring, unengaging lectures from classroom instructors who go through a slide show presentation.  \r\n\r\n--- Those of us who net less than $20k a year tend not to be familiar with Apple\u2019s product line.  This means that something as innocuous as swiping back or going to the \u2018settings\u2019 area on an iOS device can be hard to understand or describe because it\u2019s just \u201cone of those things\u201d you have to PRACTICE in order to remember.  Training might be able to fill the gaps, but with very little hands-on practice of any kind (even simulated), most of the information just goes in one ear and out the other.  Aggravating this situation is the fact that my employer (Apple\u2019s vendor) - Kelly Services - never provided the promised iPod that we could use to familiarize ourselves with the product line we would be supporting.\r\n\r\n* Poor support structure.  Just like many other call center projects, Apple has an additional level of support known as Tier 2.  This queue consists entirely of agents who are supposedly the \u201cbest of the best\u201d and are there to support customers and the agents on the frontline.  In contrast to other projects, however, agents are actually allowed to reach out to Tier 2 for help when they aren\u2019t comfortable handling a call.  Apple itself makes getting help very hard, however \u2013 even for newer agents.\r\n\r\n--- Apple tracks the number of times agents reach out to Tier 2 for support.  I don\u2019t know how the other vendors do things, but Kelly Services held agents accountable to this metric right from the start.  To keep Tier 2 escalations low, agents would be strongly encouraged to reach out to local management and chat support for assistance.\r\n\r\n--- Even if agents just needed to ask a question or get help with a call instead of escalating, the very act of dialing Tier 2\u2019s line would count as an \u201cescalation\u201d for purposes of the \u201cTier 2 Escalations\u201d metric.  While I can understand the potential for abuse of phone consultations as a method to avoid customer interactions, this puts unnecessary stress on frontline agents \u2013 especially newbie agents \u2013 who could be panicking because they don\u2019t know what the heck they\u2019re doing.\r\n\r\n--- Tier 2 also seems to have an attitude problem.  Agents on the line don\u2019t generally assume good faith in Tier 1 agents and tend to leave Tier 1 agents with the impression that the act of escalating is an inconvenience.  As a former Tier 2 phone agent and Team Lead on another project, I understand how frustrating it can be to get agents who don\u2019t use their tools before calling in; however, this lack of willingness to assist discourages Tier 1 agents from asking for help and hurts customer satisfaction.  With such a poor training process in place, reaching out to an additional level of support really should not be such an involved process.\r\n\r\n--- Adding even more stress to the situation is the fact that Tier 2 agents give \u201cpeer feedbacks,\u201d which are basically reviews on the Tier 1 agent\u2019s performance.  So, as a Tier 1 agent:  if a Tier 2 agent is miffed because their 30 minutes of \u2018available\u2019 time is interrupted with your phone call, there\u2019s nothing stopping them from giving you a negative peer feedback.\r\n\r\n--- To my utter amazement, Apple also mixes all of its Tier 2 agents from multiple vendors into one gigantic queue \u2013 a very unusual practice for a call center, in my experience.  So, when you reach out for help, you might get a Tier 2 agent from your own employer, or it could be someone from one of Apple\u2019s many vendors \u2013 all of whom have their own policies, techniques, and personalities.  This is just additional inconsistency to further complicate an already convoluted support process.\r\n\r\n* Ineffective tools.  iLog, the application that allows Apple\u2019s support agents to connect with and assist customers, tries to be an all-in-one tool for agents to efficiently assist customers.  However, it, too, has its shortcomings.\r\n\r\n--- The knowledge base (\u201cKnowledge Center\u201d) is a collection of how-to articles and procedural documentation agents use to support customers.  However, agents must rely entirely on keyword searches or a list of article suggestions (based on how agents classify their case) when finding relevant resources.  There\u2019s no menu or organized list of topics from which to drill-down.  Additionally, some questions on simpler topics are only available in product manuals, which requires a PDF file download \u2013 further extending the call\u2019s average handle time, harming agent confidence, and lowering customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\n* Strange quality expectations.  Apple\u2019s approach to empathy and rapport-building is embodied in something it coins the \u201cThree A\u2019s,\u201d which are:  Acknowledge, Align, and Assure.  Agents with Kelly Services routinely miss \u201cAlign\u201d in quality evaluations.  Sometimes, agents overlook empathy during their phone calls and don\u2019t use the right voice inflection; in Apple\u2019s case, however, I think empathy is more complex than it needs to be.  Most call centers \u2013 even the ones who use NPS and follow a CARES quality model \u2013 combine or link acknowledgement and \u201calignment\u201d together.  So, a simple statement such as, \u201cwe want to get your screen repaired so that touch functionality works normally\u201d combines acknowledgement and empathy in one simple statement.  Apple\u2019s idea of empathy (or \u201calignment\u201d), however, is \u201cI would feel that way too\u201d statements, which tend to patronize the customer \u2013 especially on calls with very simple issues."}, {"review_title": "Good brand - not so good leadership", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Specialist in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Well-known and respected brand\nDecent benefits and pay\nCool, fun coworkers \nFlexible schedule\nEnthusiasm of fellow coworkers is contagious when you're having a bad day.

As a result, most prospective Apple employees (whether direct or through a vendor) need to have some degree of experience with their products before providing service to their customers, or it\u2019s going to be an uphill battle.\r\n\r\n* Inadequate training curriculum.  Now, I know what you might be thinking; this is where Apple\u2019s responsibility might be blurred with the vendor\u2019s responsibility, since the vendor \u2013 as a contractor \u2013 provides its own trainers and can make its own adaptations to the training process for its agents.  Nevertheless, Apple clearly intends for its vendors to use their proprietary training process (known as \u201cNew Advisor Training \u2013 Academy\u201d) inside a portal known as iDesk in order to complete the training process.\r\n\r\n--- It lasts several weeks, but the training itself involves very few simulations or interaction on the part of the student.  Most of the training consists of boring, unengaging lectures from classroom instructors who go through a slide show presentation.  \r\n\r\n--- Those of us who net less than $20k a year tend not to be familiar with Apple\u2019s product line.  This means that something as innocuous as swiping back or going to the \u2018settings\u2019 area on an iOS device can be hard to understand or describe because it\u2019s just \u201cone of those things\u201d you have to PRACTICE in order to remember.  Training might be able to fill the gaps, but with very little hands-on practice of any kind (even simulated), most of the information just goes in one ear and out the other.  Aggravating this situation is the fact that my employer (Apple\u2019s vendor) - Kelly Services - never provided the promised iPod that we could use to familiarize ourselves with the product line we would be supporting.\r\n\r\n* Poor support structure.  Just like many other call center projects, Apple has an additional level of support known as Tier 2.  This queue consists entirely of agents who are supposedly the \u201cbest of the best\u201d and are there to support customers and the agents on the frontline.  In contrast to other projects, however, agents are actually allowed to reach out to Tier 2 for help when they aren\u2019t comfortable handling a call.  Apple itself makes getting help very hard, however \u2013 even for newer agents.\r\n\r\n--- Apple tracks the number of times agents reach out to Tier 2 for support.  I don\u2019t know how the other vendors do things, but Kelly Services held agents accountable to this metric right from the start.  To keep Tier 2 escalations low, agents would be strongly encouraged to reach out to local management and chat support for assistance.\r\n\r\n--- Even if agents just needed to ask a question or get help with a call instead of escalating, the very act of dialing Tier 2\u2019s line would count as an \u201cescalation\u201d for purposes of the \u201cTier 2 Escalations\u201d metric.  While I can understand the potential for abuse of phone consultations as a method to avoid customer interactions, this puts unnecessary stress on frontline agents \u2013 especially newbie agents \u2013 who could be panicking because they don\u2019t know what the heck they\u2019re doing.\r\n\r\n--- Tier 2 also seems to have an attitude problem.  Agents on the line don\u2019t generally assume good faith in Tier 1 agents and tend to leave Tier 1 agents with the impression that the act of escalating is an inconvenience.  As a former Tier 2 phone agent and Team Lead on another project, I understand how frustrating it can be to get agents who don\u2019t use their tools before calling in; however, this lack of willingness to assist discourages Tier 1 agents from asking for help and hurts customer satisfaction.  With such a poor training process in place, reaching out to an additional level of support really should not be such an involved process.\r\n\r\n--- Adding even more stress to the situation is the fact that Tier 2 agents give \u201cpeer feedbacks,\u201d which are basically reviews on the Tier 1 agent\u2019s performance.  So, as a Tier 1 agent:  if a Tier 2 agent is miffed because their 30 minutes of \u2018available\u2019 time is interrupted with your phone call, there\u2019s nothing stopping them from giving you a negative peer feedback.\r\n\r\n--- To my utter amazement, Apple also mixes all of its Tier 2 agents from multiple vendors into one gigantic queue \u2013 a very unusual practice for a call center, in my experience.  So, when you reach out for help, you might get a Tier 2 agent from your own employer, or it could be someone from one of Apple\u2019s many vendors \u2013 all of whom have their own policies, techniques, and personalities.  This is just additional inconsistency to further complicate an already convoluted support process.\r\n\r\n* Ineffective tools.  iLog, the application that allows Apple\u2019s support agents to connect with and assist customers, tries to be an all-in-one tool for agents to efficiently assist customers.  However, it, too, has its shortcomings.\r\n\r\n--- The knowledge base (\u201cKnowledge Center\u201d) is a collection of how-to articles and procedural documentation agents use to support customers.  However, agents must rely entirely on keyword searches or a list of article suggestions (based on how agents classify their case) when finding relevant resources.  There\u2019s no menu or organized list of topics from which to drill-down.  Additionally, some questions on simpler topics are only available in product manuals, which requires a PDF file download \u2013 further extending the call\u2019s average handle time, harming agent confidence, and lowering customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\n* Strange quality expectations.  Apple\u2019s approach to empathy and rapport-building is embodied in something it coins the \u201cThree A\u2019s,\u201d which are:  Acknowledge, Align, and Assure.  Agents with Kelly Services routinely miss \u201cAlign\u201d in quality evaluations.  Sometimes, agents overlook empathy during their phone calls and don\u2019t use the right voice inflection; in Apple\u2019s case, however, I think empathy is more complex than it needs to be.  Most call centers \u2013 even the ones who use NPS and follow a CARES quality model \u2013 combine or link acknowledgement and \u201calignment\u201d together.  So, a simple statement such as, \u201cwe want to get your screen repaired so that touch functionality works normally\u201d combines acknowledgement and empathy in one simple statement.  Apple\u2019s idea of empathy (or \u201calignment\u201d), however, is \u201cI would feel that way too\u201d statements, which tend to patronize the customer \u2013 especially on calls with very simple issues."}, {"review_title": "Good brand - not so good leadership", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Specialist in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Well-known and respected brand\nDecent benefits and pay\nCool, fun coworkers \nFlexible schedule\nEnthusiasm of fellow coworkers is contagious when you're having a bad day.

We have to make sure we sell the AppleCare Protection Plan to at least 3 customers out of 100, must maintain customer satisfaction goal of 80% (hard to do if customer gives a bad review for something you can't control). \r\n\r\nFor instance, if a customer calls in since their brand new computer is broken and you refer to the store to get it fixed, they can give you a negative survey which in turns makes your stats come down. Now management wants you to explain why they didn't approve of your service, etc., even though the calls are recorded. \r\n\r\nThey implemented a new call strategy called H2H. It entails me asking the customer permission to ask them questions (why do I have to ask them for permission if they are calling for help?), empathize with the customer (never enough empathy on your weekly reviews per manager), determine the customer's state of mind and talk to them dependant upon their personality. I must align myself with the customer (never do it since I have no idea what I am actually doing), assure the customer their issue will be resolved and make sure to clarify their resolution. \r\n\r\nYou have to make sure you solve at least 70% of customer issues (hard to do when the computer needs physical work done at the store), maintain a customer satisfaction goal of 80% (also hard to do when you get bad surveys because a customer was out of warranty and didn't want to pay for support $19), you also must make sure your calls are around 14.5 minutes long (too short, you're in trouble, too long, you're in trouble). \r\n\r\nDont expect to have a life. Mandatory OT for Christmas and other holidays. Also when there is a new product release. Good luck having a vacation during holiday time. \r\n\r\nWhile on the phone you get a call around every 8 seconds so it's hard to take a breather. You must type notes while talking to the customer so you can make sure to take another call. If you don't hustle between calls you know what happens, another chewing out by your manager. \r\n\r\nTo top it all off you have 3 exams to take  that you must pass or get fired. It's 8 hours a day training for 4 weeks. If you miss a day of training for any reason, you are fired. You do 4 hours a day of instructor led training and 4 hours just reading your own materials. If you don't read you won't pass and you will get fired. 5 people from my team didn't make it. \r\n\r\nLastly, don't expect to advance quickly. Most managers are promoted at an average around 4 years. The bad thing is they will give a regular employee backfill (manager perks but no additional pay) to help the managers out. The backfill will review calls and critique your work and do the managers work. Most people never make it to manager even while backfilling. A guy on our team has been backfilling for over 2 years. They make it seem once you backfill the manager position opens for you. But that's a lie. They do a lot of external hiring for managers instead of inside. Last hiring spree they hired 4 external hires for manager and only 2 internal. My manager has no idea how to do my job since he was hired externally. He can't give me advice or pointers since he doesn't know. \r\n\r\nI am in the process of looking for other employment opportunities.

Some groups may be different but in many you are graded on how many bugs you fix how quickly, not how many you examine, or resolve in other ways but how many code is changed for.  No matter what your expertise eveyone has to prove themselves in the same trenches.  This is disaster if you are older but very experienced.  Few 50+ or even 40+ software engineers can sling code as fast as their 20 or 30 year peers or self.  There is little acknowledgment of different skills and needs.

Each release, every part of the software practically may change at once and throughout the entire period.  Little or no layering or getting the base layers solid for the next level of development.  Constant eating of dogfood.  Sometimes you can't get your own work down for long stretches because of bad internal builds.  Oh yeah, you are often expected to install and attempt to work on several new builds a month.   There is little or no internal documentation or formal software design whatsoever.   Just a lot of bright programmers flaying away for the most part.   Sad, so much brain power wasted.   The secrecy is so bad you are not allowed to know things that have direct bearing on your own area and even on your success.   The only documentation of much of the software is in the bug tracking system and in mail and all ad hoc.  As you struggle to fix your quota of bugs you learn to find the minimal patch that works without blowing things up.  This leaves the software a shoddy non-cohesive patchwork over time.\r\n\r\nApple is arrogant as hell or rather some of its VPs and Jobs himself dictate how many things should be done that many of its senior engineers know is the wrong way to proceed.   Apple has a serious phobia about using good database technology and shipping same.   Core Data is good as far as it goes but that isn't all that far as far as db capabilities.  It is oriented to one app only.  In general Apple has a very App centric view.   And senior management loves files.  Lots and lots of little files - even one per record.

In terms of motivation, peer relationships (the people that work there are incredible and some of the smartest people I ever met)\r\n\r\n- BEST medical, dental, vision, life insurance benefits I ever came across.  Compared to every other company  I worked for no one comes close to Apple's benefits.  The dentist I used actually mentioned that they never had any patient with as high dental coverage as the plan Apple ensures.\r\n\r\n- Very challenging.  If your going for a promotion your NOT competing against nobodies.  These are some of the most intelligent, innovative and hard working people I know in my life.  It made promotions a real challenge but that's a good thing I think.  Makes you work harder and appreciate what you get.\r\n\r\n- Good 401k and stock options.  Apple has some great 401k and stock options, again I haven't seen any other company I worked for offer such benefits.\r\n\r\n- Great discounts on products.  A good example of this is I paid $1,000 for a $2,000 iMac.  Some co workers bought a MacBook Air that costed $999 and paid less than $300.  \r\n\r\n- Caring company.  I couldn't believe this but it's true.  I had a lot of stuff happen to me the last 2 years with my marriage and life, where I had to take ALOT of days off and was a wreck when I was there.  They not only worked with me but were there for me.    Especially the employees who offered any and all support.  Won't forget that.\r\n\r\n- Career advancement.  THIS IS HUGE!  If you come in as a employee, even as a entry Apple Store specialist you can go anywhere and everywhere.  You can be transferred to work at any Apple Store nationwide, or if you want go work at Corporate and even be part of software and hardware design teams.

Some aspects of corporate culture that I see shared by most (if not all) areas in apple: \r\n   1) A standard of excellence, which can be extremely satisfying for perfectionists. At other companies that I have worked, there tends to be a mentality that as soon as something is 'good enough' it is pushed into QA or production. At Apple, things don't move forward until they are excellent.\r\n   2) Passion for work. I've never been at a large company where employees are genuinely this passionate about their work. You won't encounter any of the apathy that you often find in large corporations. \r\n   3) Cool problems. Numbers 1) and 2) are arguably made possible on a widespread level within the company because the problems that engineers are working to solve can be extremely interesting. Additionally, solutions almost always have a large footprint of impact due to the number of people who interact with Apple products on a day-to-day basis. You won't find yourself doing anything remedial.\r\n\r\nSo now the question becomes- how are things different in IS&T from other parts of the company? The answer is that it doesn't really. If anything, the impact of what you are working on is larger than in some other areas because a lot of what IS&T does is the foundation that makes consumer facing products possible to run on. There are entire companies out there that *only* make a one of the products that a given team in IS&T produces, and there is a good chance that IS&T is doing a better job of it. While all the teams in IS&T are different, I think that these general principles are true for all of them.", "cons": "One of the things that I found challenging was the modularity of the teams. By that, I mean that the teams in IS&T don't interact much with other teams except for when they have to for business reasons. Socially speaking, I don't see a lot of full time employees eating lunch with people from other teams that often. Also, within my own team I never really felt like I had a strong social connection to the people I worked with- people were often just coming in and doing their own work without really interacting that much with other people in the cubes around them. This means that in order to make work friends you kind of have to go out of your way to initiate contact with other people, which can make the first couple months of work a little tougher.

There is a long list of smaller non-standard fringe benefits only Apple could offer.\r\n\r\n- The general work environment is positive, passionate, and high energy with absolute dedication to diversity and a zero tolerance for discrimination of any type.\r\n\r\n- If you love technology and/or helping others with it, are honest with good ethics, fairly intelligent, and even if you are a bit on the quirky or mildly eccentric side you will thrive here. \r\n\r\n- The hourly salary is good. Depending on where the store is located can approach being competitive having adjusted for the negatives of a public facing retail setting.\r\n\r\n- Intense training with 90% non-technical customer relations and communications training.\r\n\r\n- Opportunities to move up are many if you want to stay in retail. Apple lays out a reasonable opportunity to ascend to management or cross-train to other roles but mind you NOT technically. It can be extremely difficult to cross from retail to corporate with a wider and wider gap between the two versions of Apple.\r\n\r\n- You will work with amazing, intelligent, thoughtful, and energetic people from all walks of life, cultures, and lifestyles.\r\n\r\n- Change and new products keep coming providing you fun cutting edge stuff to sell, fix, work with, and support.\r\n\r\n- There are decent discounts on things including a periodic technology allowance on Macs or iPads", "cons": "- The Genius and/or Family Room Specialist roles were once considered technical support roles but now less and less becoming more of a customer relations role with technical trappings.\r\n\r\n- You are working with the public from all walks of life and every level of intelligence, education, income, and idiosyncrasy -- sometimes bordering on crazy.\r\n\r\n- Expect to be stressed most of the time caught between policy and customer demands with management mostly favoring whatever the customer wants. It can seem at times that every customer is an exception to the rule and policies mostly are disposable depending on the pushback from the customer.\r\n\r\n- If the customer gets angry at you for following policy you had nothing to do with treating you with extreme rudeness and disrespect that can go as far as being physical, depending on the store and manager, you likely will find yourself under the bus with management expecting you to act as if you did not notice or mind the sacrifice. The manager may even attempt a \u2018Jedi mind trick\u2019 to get agreement from you that it was the right thing to do something nice for the customer that did anything but treat you nice under the guise of \u2018surprise and delight\u2019.\r\n\r\n- The environment of most Apple stores is hyper noisy, crowded, full of customer generated drama and general knee jerk reactionary activity.\r\n\r\n- If you are technical and expect to be exposed to technical training realize you will get a little of that but mostly not. This is not a good place to nurture technical expertise. They want you to certify and train on various hardware platforms but won't give you time to do it and really don\u2019t care if you keep up to date with it or not. They will teach you enough to squeeze by and are more interested in how many customers you can process, on time, with as little time spent as possible with each customer without getting a negative review from the customer.\r\n\r\n- 99% of the managers are drawn from other retail environments with little or no technical background with the assumption that retail is retail. \r\n\r\n- Apple Retail has developed its own special brand of dogma separate from that of Apple Corporate with pocket wallet reference cards to remind you of what the mission is, mandatory daily/quarterly meetings where you are expected to act enthusiastic and participate in 'fun' team building activities that may remind you of kindergarten or Sunday school. It's well intended but at times makes one feel like you are seen as a child. Some of the managers really take this stuff to heart and it can at times be too much causing you to think they have lost touch with reality while you are in the trenches with customers that are very much in touch with reality. The disconnect can be surreal at times.\r\n\r\n- Work/Life balance may forever be an issue with Apple. Your schedule is all over the place days on, days off, time in, time out, mandatory meetings on your scheduled day off, and where you work inside the store. A typical 40 hour week can FEEL like 60 because the schedule is so fragmented and erratic and cut into slices best for the store\u2019s needs and peak times. If you are fortunate enough you may be in a store with a management team that, to their credit, experiment with trying to provide mostly fixed workday schedules. It's too early to tell if efforts like this can last.\r\n\r\n- Turn-over and burn-out is HIGH! This means very little lasting expertise stays on board long. The tech support workers are extremely shallow technically. There is an effort underway to automate as much of the technical troubleshooting as possible with guided case-structured repair/replacement ticketing software so non-technical transitory staff can do the work. Sadly, if the title of \u2018Genius\u2019 ever was descriptive of the expertise of the person filling the role it certainly is a misnomer now.\r\n\r\n- Hope you are working in a newer store. Apple Retail's recent focus on developing showcase stores in other countries has taken the eye off the ball of keeping US infrastructure up to date and well equipped. Older stores are rundown, ill-equipped, extremely crowed with employees, noisy, and generally disorganized leading to much higher employee stress and burn-out and a not so great customer experience.\r\n \r\n- Apple Retail has an almost cult dedication to the Lominger Competency FYI Card Sort strategy for personal development which attempts to scientifically rate and analyze one\u2019s core career attributes. This blind reliance on this single tool produces an almost lemming quality leader and manager completely disjoint with a company known for using lemmings to show what\u2019s wrong with blindly following anything that diminishes your choice and unique way of doing things in it\u2019s famous 1984 commercial."}, {"review_title": "iOS Advisor (At-Home)", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Sept 2015", "job_title": "At Home Advisor in Lansing, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture, very supportive, went out of their way to help you in the day-to-day work.", "cons": "Biggest downside was the size of the bureaucracy.

If you don't have time for a rep's performance improvement and development, how the heck are you expecting them to improve? \r\n-During that busy time (which they said would only last a few weeks, turned into months) this was not even during a launch period. meetings and trainings that were required were being canceled but somehow we were expected to complete them while being on 3+ chats at a time. \r\n-They wanted reps to go above and beyond but with it being so busy there was literally almost no time to stand out unless you had 4 hands. I had to do many of my extra projects and presentation preps during my breaks/lunches and off time because the environment was too busy and stressful during scheduled work time. \r\n-Systems didn't work properly all the time and were poorly structured. My last job literally had one hub that we would go to for troubleshooting and then go from there. Apple wants to be different and have 1000's of articles that we have to search find through quickly when many of them had too many steps that didn't fix the issue causing a poor customer experience.

Unlike a lot of other retail chains, you actually want most of the products being sold.  On top of this, there are a lot of discounts extended to Apple employees by 3rd part manufacturers that do business with Apple.  You have to sift through the pages of the Apple's Employee webpage (only accessible from the store's break room) in order to find out about these.  Once you're employed for over 3 months you earn a $500 discount for a single, large Apple product (iMac/MacBook).  It takes an additional 3 years to earn this discount again, so it's best to use it upfront unless you plan on making a career out of working retail.  There are also a set amount of smaller discounts provided to each employee, which reset at the beginning of each calendar year.  They make a small dent in the inflated price of Apple products, but are worth it if you stack them with the $500 voucher.\r\n\r\nSome people would say \"helping people\" is a large pro of this job; you're fixing problems with iPhones and educating mostly incompetent consumers, non-stop.  I would disagree.  The high expectations put on the FRS's by Apple/management do not reflect the modest retail wage.", "cons": "The customers.  Everything is an emergency when it comes to the customer's iPhones.  They want their phones fixed, and they want them fixed now, which for some reason causes your average consumer to lose their humanity.  People assume that it's Apple's fault that they dropped their device in the toilet (90% of the water damaged phones), or that the screen was faulty because they dropped it 10ft onto the concrete and it cracked.  Everyone else in line be damned, they're time is more important and they demand to be seen first.  People also don't understand the very basic principles of a warranty.  \"I know it's out of warranty, but my 5-year-old phone isn't as loud as it used to be.  I didn't do anything.  Apple should replace it for free.\"\r\n\r\nThe FRS is not only responsible for taking these iPhone appointments every 10 minutes (a very demanding time limit per appointment), but are also tasked with teaching One-to-One customers with 30 minute and 1 hour personal training sessions.  The amount of knowledge you're required to absorb (mostly on your own time since Apple is only really interested in teaching customer service during training) is immense, and insures that you'll be discussing work-related issues during your breaks.\r\n\r\nYou have no downtime with this job.  On one hand, the day goes quicker when you're shotgunning tech support to 40+ customers, but it gets taxing.  The front of the store (normal \"Specialists\") who are tasked with working basic sales and the like, are given as much time per customer as they see fit.  If you want to spend your days interacting with your coworkers rather than rushing through appointments, take this job instead.  It pays a dollar or so less, on average, but is an entirely different experience when it comes to working at the Apple Store.\r\n\r\nAlso, the hours are erratic.  As a part-time job, the FRS position takes up ALL of your time.  This is because you're scheduled only a few hours per day, almost EVERY day.  It's hard to predict what your hours will be, week to week, which makes it impossible to schedule something in your free time.  You have to give a minimum of 3 weeks notice to get a day off, and it's not guaranteed that they'll give it to you.  On top of this, all the other FRS's are working a minimum of 5 days a week, and because Apple has to pay time-and-a-half on the 6th day, nobody else is allowed to cover your shift."}, {"review_title": "Great Brand to have on Resume", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Applecare At Home Advisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "WORKING FROM HOME.

Apple pretty much pays living wages, which is higher than comparable positions of the same caliber at other companies.  Also overtime is offered during the busy times/product launches, which is great if you need the extra money.\r\n\r\nMISC. Telling people you work for Apple is a great conversation starter..  The SWAG they send, and they send you all the equipment needed to perform your job. Discounts on Apple products are great as well.", "cons": "SHIFTS AND SCHEDULING.  Anybody in the Apple AHA environment knows that one thing that keeps on changing is your schedule. If you value having a set schedule or have a lot of other commitments, then I would advise not to take a job in the AHA-sphere.  Your shift is assigned based on your stats, but sometimes it can really just be random.  And then you are stuck with the schedule, unless you are lucky enough to find someone to trade with.  In addition to the schedule change frequency is the type of schedules that are offered.  I've never seen such an odd array of schedules, with some schedules you do not have time to do anything but work, and very little time for anything else.  Their explanation is the schedules are made to accommodate when the customers contact us (however weekends still seem to have a massive call/chat volume and understaffed.)\r\n\r\nTRANSFERS. For some reason, you can be transferred to a different team or have a different manager transferred to your team out of the blue.  Changing of mangers a lot is a biggie, as each have their own personal way doing things and \"rules\".  So what was okay with one manager, may not be okay with another, and vice versa.  \r\n\r\nWORKING FROM HOME.  Although mentioned as a pro, can be a con as well.  Working from home constantly can soon become mundane and getting a case of cabin fever.  Also you can feel a bit disconnected from your teammates since you are not in the same room/building/office with them talking face to face.\r\n\r\nMISC. A small con in regards to metrics/stats and policies.  You are always coached on providing a customer with more than average interaction, and strive to have complete customer satisfaction.  Of course this is easier said than done, as there are many policies in place that prevent us from giving a customer the resolution they want, and this of course will effect your metrics/stats.
