In fact, many of their support orgs practice blatant discrimination. For example. some folks are permitted to work remotely from home, while others are told it's not possible. I am an employee who was with Apple for over a decade, and routinely got stellar performance reviews. I was also promoted multiple times. I also have a chronic serious health condition, where I was told despite the pandemic I would not be able work remotely once things resumed in-office. Meanwhile, other folks within the org were permitted to move to other cities and work remotely, for seemingly lesser reasons. \r\n\r\nApple is not the forward-thinking, kindly company they portray themselves to be. In addition, someone within my org several years ago disclosed confidential personal information related to my health to an outside party at another company, and no action was taken against this employee. Apple needs to seriously consider the HR implications related to this illegal behavior.\r\n\r\nI have since left for a better, more inclusive company that values remote work and equitable solutions for all employees, without discriminating. I leave this review to warn others of the reality of working at Apple, and also because I still believe the company has some great people there.

No vision, no strategy, sheer lack of communication, interested only in their self promotion, micro management, making numbers look good. When you witness constant turn over of people two levels up than yours, people with good salaries and much better perks, it is not a good sign.\r\n- Criteria to get promoted is to be buddy with the girls club but mostly show you believe in them and in serving them regardless of your own responsibilities or the benefit of customers.\r\n- Clear exodus of knowledgeable people as you will catch up with the best people there and you will realise your colleagues in the US are far more/better trained, have access to more resources.\r\n- Management \u201cstrategy\u201d is to show numbers, so the more calls you take, the better, never mind the outcome/quality. To achieve that, they are willing to get you to take calls unrelated to your job description, admin calls, developer calls whilst punishing you if you stay too long on the phone. After doing that for a long time, your expertise start to dissolve, if you have technical knowledge at the start, you are very likely to regress not applying it on a regular basis.\r\n- No flexibility for your holidays. Incredibly hard to get it around Christmas, so people just call in sick. Some managers will grant holidays according to your results.\r\n- The number of people on sick leave is pretty high, this stretches the rest of the team for an indefinite amount of time. But if it is justifiable to upper management, then it is ok. They will make sure to put pressure on those same people, so they will eventually leave.\r\n- No car park in the city centre office.\r\n- Starting salary has not been revised in over 10 years whilst other departments have revised theirs.\r\nI could go on\u2026"}, {"review_title": "good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good I mean everything to be honest", "cons": "Not gonna lie I don\u2019t know about it"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Sales Assistant in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits\r\nFast paced environment \r\nGood colleagues and management", "cons": "Therapy like culture,\r\nBoring,\r\nLunch not paid"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Sales Floor Team Member in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Team oriented \r\nFlexible company \r\nGood benefits", "cons": "None that I can think of"}, {"review_title": "None", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "25 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Graduate StudentTechnical", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is great working here", "cons": "None to tell here now"}, {"review_title": "Okay Place to Work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Technical Specialist in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Clients are fun to work with if you're a people person.", "cons": "Retail store is hectic.
