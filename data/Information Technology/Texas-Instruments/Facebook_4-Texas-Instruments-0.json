Although each day is calculated for over-time, the second week reaches it's 40-hour limit on the 4th day after only 5.5 hours so the 5 hours remaining on the 4th day is all over-time not just the 3.5 hours as calculated in the days previous.

The rotation program is perfect for those straight out of college to meet other people their age, get exposed to a wide range of the businesses end-to-end, and contribute (or even lead) high-impact projects. I fully believe this is one of the best first jobs for highly motivated graduates. I found lifelong mentors and friends, traveled internationally for conferences and customer meetings, and jump-started my career as a product marketer due to the volume, range, and impact of my responsibilities. The profit sharing, stock purchase plan, 401k match, and PTO are generous.", "cons": "This is an extremely stressful job. The extent of that is highly driven by which business unit you are assigned and your manager, but in general the company brings in high-achieving graduates excited to join the workforce and exploits them for their energy and willingness to take on too much or stretch themselves too thin. \n\nWe had multiple calls with our colleagues in India or China that lasted until past 10PM every week , every email from sales was immediately escalated, and the range of our responsibilities was so broad I never had clear focus about my goals except \"increase revenue\". We were constantly hammered by sales to lower our prices and destroy the market value just so they could sell a different part on the BOM at a higher price. On top of all that, the entire business unit would be constantly preparing for quarterly business reviews, annual planning, or deep dives so that our senior management could keep their jobs rather than us doing actual work. When I put in my 2 week notice, I was told to keep it a secret from the team until the very last day because the team couldn't be distracted from preparing for one of these meetings.\n\nThe core mindsets and behaviors were drilled into us and used against us to push us to work harder, for longer hours, without so much as a line or two of positive feedback. There's tons of opportunity to do a lot, learn skills, and pad your resume, but internal upward mobility is extremely competitive. TI has a very political office culture and who you know will or get face-time with will determine if you move up or not.\n\nThe type of person that would want a job like this probably doesn't want to coast or take an unchallenging job, but this company pushes people in this role beyond their limit and gaslights them to think its normal.

TI was a once industry defining company that is now one that most people don\u2019t even realize is still in business. TI is in a business that just doesn\u2019t promote or rely on innovation, and as such they don\u2019t incentivize their talent in any special way, nor do they seem to concern themselves with the retention of any of their workforce.\r\nTheir claim to fame is the efforts of a single employee, Jack Kilby, whose contributions to TI are over forty years old, back when TI was a different company with different goals. Now they\u2019ve devolved into a budget business reliant on used equipment, decades old technology, and human resource practices that I haven\u2019t seen any company employ in over twenty years.\r\nTI is a profitable company, for sure. But profitability is not a direct measure of the employee experience or the culture of the company. The truth is that my transition to TI saw a huge increase in my employee health care costs, a massive reduction in budget, and a complete 180 in enabling innovation and career growth.\r\nMy advice to people that are looking at jobs at TI is to not be fooled by any of the short-term recruiting tactics. There are extremely limited career opportunities once you hire on. There is a huge lack of incentive to retain employees past the first 2-5 years. And finally, and most importantly, the culture of doing the bare minimum for the bare minimum is extremely frustrating, especially if you want to do bigger and better things with your life. Other than a simple steady paycheck, which I understand is all that some folks need, TI doesn\u2019t do much for the soul.

Good mentoring from the experienced, but rapidly shrinking experienced workforce. Most managers are understanding of work life balance. Good profit sharing maxing out at 20% for the last few years. Discounted employee stock options with 15% discount. 4% 401k company match. Best chance for promotion is in managerial ladder. Big company with many groups makes it easy to move around while maintaining benefits, learning different roles and functions, and obtaining experience. Each group can have very different work environment and culture. Work tends to be highly involved with local offices and customers in China, India, and Europe. Good set of company values. Large field group with prescence in many countries. Lately taking some efforts to improve diversity in upper management and technical ladder. Some managers are very good and do not micromanage their direct reports.", "cons": "Some really awful managers that somehow maintain their position through the years. Little diversity in technical ladder with big emphasis on design engineers. Hard to get promoted in the technical ladder. Extreme cost cutting on employee computers, software, and IT departments, while company pays for a lot of customer visits and travel. High push for security and locking down computer resources that gets in the way of doing your job. Very old lab equipment with very long process for any capital expenses. Mostly hiring new college graduates. Most innovation is just incremental, not given much latitude to experiment. Due to large number of new college graduates, experienced workers spend a lot of time training new employees. Most new college graduates do not stay more than 5 years, so experienced engineers are constantly training people. Prepare for many early morning and late evening meetings due to working with co-workers in China and India. Centralized labs facilities are very noisy, crowded benches, small or no monitors, and difficult to concentrate. Some open office areas deter collaboration rather than foster it due to distracting noise. Management highly focused on short term gains rather than more involved and well thought long term plans. For example, big push to sell what we have and have very short design cycles were features are removed, instead of trying to understand why a device does not sell and spend the time to make a better device. Most employee career focus is just for new college graduates, so experienced workers tend to stall and leave the company. Your salary growth is highly dependent on your initial hiring salary. Hard to catch up if you fail to negotiate a good salary or we\u2019re hired close to a recession. You might find yourself a few years down the road earning less than a new college graduate a few years down the road. Texas locations suffer from personnel that have highly partisan views that does not favor science and regard for facts. Little diversity at upper management that has seen some advances in the last few years.

We are talking 12+ dollars an hour difference! This is because one asked for a low number thinking that is typical pay for the industry and the other asked high. I work with a guy on night shift that makes 28 an hour while his friend is making 40 an hour with less experience for the same exact position. Management and HR openly accept people at low amounts and then question why they leave later. This is bad business imo. My discussion with my supervisors while attempting to \u201cretain\u201d me included them factoring in my night shift differential as my pay. They use this to compare against a higher hourly day shift position and act as if this is why your pay is what it is. A night shift differential is given because NOBODY wants night shift and you are missing out on time with your family so they pay you an extra amount based on that aspect. IT IS NOT TO MAKE THE SAME HOURLY AS A DAYSHIFT EQUIVALENT POSITION WHILE WORKING NIGHTS! Do yourself a favor and go to a company that will pay you what you\u2019re worth and not just what you say the minimum you\u2019ll accept is.
