The best learnings and take away from working in TI: I just can't feel the pressure of working where I am now because the pressure in TI was the worst!

If you're a cum laude, you're wasting your years here if you plan to stay. They can't hire experienced engineers because they cannot pay as much. Yes, they pay too little. If you look at most engineers who stayed for 10+ years, they are sad, negative minded, and have not gone anywhere (financially at least). Only those who get promoted to managers will get paid well. But even managers are not spared from the pressure. They have this culture that you're giving your life to TI. You give your weekends to TI. You give your holidays, restdays, you must overtime if there's an issue (and there's always an issue! It's a trap), They e-mail at night. Engineers can't do sh*t to production supervisors or managers. You cannot practice real engineering because delivery is their priority. They say Quality is number 1 but they don't practice that. You are pressured to just deliver. If you're a cum laude engineer, use TI as a stepping stone to abroad. If you plan to stay in PH, maybe 3 to 5 years is enough then go out! They won't even care cause they'll just hire the next batches of cum laudes. They are really smart to keep the salary low by hiring new college graduates. I moved out, got paid double by the another company and then got easily promoted. If you have a family, stay away from TI.

You have to understand that working in IT at TI means you are fundamentally supporting the business, so you won't be on the cutting edge of technology necessarily. Of course that does have its perks, but you'll have to decide for yourself if that's desirable.

They say they want to improve moral. But they hire manufacturing employees through a contracting company and give them no benefits  (no 401k, discounted stock, health insurance) and keep them waiting to be 'converted' to TI for YEARS. They should have a minimum of 1 year to conversion, but some people wait 4-5 years before TI hires them. That seems highly unethical.  And definitely contributes to low moral and turn over. Also, the training is poor. There is too much emphasis on moves over quality.

I highly recommend taking these courses, even if that means taking a day from work to do so. \r\n\r\nThe only jobs I recommend at TI are HR and Digital Marketing.", "cons": "PAY / PROMOTIONS  / WORK-LIFE BALANCE\r\nStarting pay is great but over the years, the raises are not competitive. They pay you less and work you more than other companies. I have not heard of a single person unhappy with their decision to leave TI. \r\n\r\nThe culture of the managers is to make you feel like you should be GRATEFUL for the breadcrumb raises and to not even ask for more. They make you believe that the typical annual inflation raise (that every other company offers) is a merit-based raise. It's actually very, very difficult to get a true raise, bonus, or RSU. They don't openly talk about the fact that there even is such a thing as a mid-year raise to be considered for. Other companies give you shares when you start, an annual inflation raise, AND a true merit-based raise. And other companies have a better work-life balance. TI will say they do, but when you start working 10-14 hour days, you'll understand it's just words.  This gaslighting behavior is one of the biggest reasons I left and never want to go back. It's a toxic culture. \r\n\r\nManagers across the board have fallen short on promises made to employees whether they're raises, bonuses, RSUs, or promotions. Promotion methods are very unclear. While there are some great managers, there are a good number of bad managers that seem to be in that position because they're pals with upper management. Even when many, many people leave TI or leave the group to escape that manager, that doesn't register with HR or they don't care.  This is not a good place for upward mobility. \r\n\r\nTECHNOLOGY\r\nTI is not longer an innovative company. They're never going to be at the forefront of technology. They're followers and it's not that exciting. \r\n\r\nROTATION PROGRAMS\r\nThe rotation programs were one of the biggest reasons I recommended joining TI but now they've cut so much from the programs that you don't get the benefits from them. They seem to play the role of temps during their rotation: cheap labor to do menial tasks that product lines don't have the time to do. If you get a good manager, you'll learn and grow a lot. But most of the time, rotators are treated this way.  Also they got rid of the pay bump you get when you deploy to your full-time role. \r\n\r\nSALES / FIELD ROLES\r\nThey're turning the TSR role more into a data-entry role and the FAE is taking on both responsibilities. I do not recommend joining TI if you want to go into a TSR or FAE role. \r\n\r\nPRODUCT MARKETING ENGINEER\r\nThis is a made-up role by TI (or maybe ADI, who pays more) that combines the responsibilities of a Business Development Manager and a Product Marketing Manager while paying you one salary for 2 roles. It's also difficult to translate this role to other companies. Most other companies have never heard of a \"Product Marketing Engineer\".  While this role is fun with strategy and all the travel, it doesn't help a lot with becoming an expect as a BDM or as a PMM. It may not be a great move for your career unless you want to stay with TI. \r\n\r\nTI knows they're the main company to be at in Dallas as a EE and they treat their employees accordingly."}, {"review_title": "Process Engineer", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Process and Equipment Engineer in Richardson, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Challenges you to be a problem solver.

One of the best practices of TI management is in their support of employees moving to different jobs and taking on new directions.  In most companies I've worked with management frowned on any ambitious career movement and many times it was held against you if your plans were discovered.  At TI, this is viewed as diversification of knoweldge and generally supported.\r\n\r\nThe working environment is fairly autonomous for most all the professional positions within the company.  If you feel you need to investigate a particular area such as a new software tool or spend some time studying a new aspect of the project you are working on then you just do it.  Schedule management is significantly up to the individual, at least as long as you can keep it from slipping.\r\n\r\nBenefits are comparable to that of most large companies.  For the last several years there has been a significant push for healthy living and work/life balance.  I know that underlying this is some study espousing the economic upside of happy healthy employees on the medical benefits balance sheet and also with regards to productivity but I'm fine with that because TI is stepping up in this regard.\r\n\r\nOverall employee moral is fairly decent.  There is of course the usual griping about all manner of stuff but overall, if you're the kind who likes to set their own day to day schedule, TI is probably your kind of workplace.\r\n\r\nI feel the senior leadership has done a pretty good job in managing responses to a changing market.  Although TI has consistantly fell short of expectation this year, the delta is right at the margins.  All this combined with the fear that Nokia is looking to multi source its inventory has hit hard on stocks but TI has shown it is flexible and can react quickly to recover from less than stellar years.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I feel I am treated fairly and my opinion is respected.  Most of the people in TI are dedicated and intelligent and if you take the time to network a bit you can find ample resources to support your goals.", "cons": "TI is such an open company that it can be difficult to generate momentum for some ideas.  You really have to be willing to be a politician as well if you really want an idea to flourish because you must convince enough people that it would be worth persuing.  This can eat up quite a bit of time and if you're not careful, you can find yourself short of time for the work that is currently on your plate.  You have to be vigilent in managing your time as well as your goals.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that there are too many sales people that have not really worked in a product team and had to completely see a product through to completion.  They are always expecting something to take a couple of hours or a day at most but the reality is it is usually a couple of weeks at least and then they do not respect that you have to weave their project into an already crowed schedule.  Too late though, they've already promised the customer and you're on the hook.\r\n\r\nSales drives most upper management and if a sales team really wants something they can usually push their priority down your throat if they want to.  I understand that the bottom line is revenue but sometimes I feel like quality is sacrificed too much and we end up with an upset client rather than one we should have been honest with initially and simply told them we don't have the time.  I'm sure someone will post a comment telling me I'm nieve in this respect but this is my opinion, not theirs.  I blame upper management for this to a certain extent because it seems that a majority of it has risen through the sales force rather than through engineering."}], [{"review_title": "Good Tech, Decent Benefits, Decent Work Culture, Tough to Get out of the \"Bottom Pile\", Other big company problems.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Nov 2009", "job_title": "Applications Engineer in Stafford, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "+ Good Technology: TI has several good technology value propositions that make it a good place to work (and learn i.e. grow professionally).\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of people (or were when I worked there) who are senior, career TI'ers who will teach their juniors a lot.
