For example: if an employee decides to leave the company without serving notice period of 1 month, employee will have to pay 1 month salary.

Holidays are 10 in an year. This is less as compared to industry standard.\r\n* A major portion of the pay is given in terms of RSUs which is not good because when you leave, the unvested RSUs go away and you are not able to show a good baseline to your next employer so I'd say negotiate in the beginning itself to have cash instead of RSU.\r\n- Politics within sub-teams in bangalore.

Broadcom Corp no longer exists.  As of Feb 1, 2015, Broadcom LTD takes over as the AVAGO/Broadcom hybrid deformity that used to be a great company.  The New Broadcom LTD will be an amazing case study of truly autocratic executive management with no social responsibility for HR researchers in the coming years. \r\n\r\nWhen mergers happen, everyone knows that there will be changes, layoffs, growing pains, etc.  That is a given, we all know and accept that.  However, this isn\u2019t that \u2013 its worse.  The new executive management (which is quite literally only one person) has already proven to be illogical (like, I can\u2019t exaggerate how insanely illogical) and narcissistic in manipulating and bullying the AVAGO way into business decisions before the transaction has even finalized.  Even the outgoing, now very wealthy executives were daily looking at each other and mouthing \"what the ........\".\r\n\r\nEverything you may have read about the new CEO from AVAGO (and his cohorts) online is true:  his only motivator is finding a way to increase share price.  Employee safety, satisfaction, retention, career development, engagement, industry reputation, environmental impact, cultural/social responsibility -- none of those priorities exist anymore in Broadcom LTD.\r\n\r\nChanges are very quickly coming that will have a huge, unrecoverable impact on the many business unit\u2019s ability to operate.  Many will fail their regulatory and customer audits because the required personnel, processes, and assets will simply not exist anymore.  It\u2019s not typical changes such as \u201dinstead of calling Bob with your question you now call Fred\u201d; there will not be anyone to call anymore!  Some business units will not have the ability to secure their customer\u2019s IP, other units will not have the RnD support they need to maintain market share. Those business units not able to meet their required 40% operating margin will be sold off, resulting in the scaling down of the organization, and loss of market share.\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the changes already announced, in some cases implemented, and in some cases being planned and not announced to the general employee population.  Keep in mind, some of these moves technically do reduce the accounting figures listed on a balance sheet, but they cause an incalculable amount of increased secondary costs of employee safety/injury, frustration, fear and resentment, delays to market, failed audits, de-certifications, increased turnover, increased theft, :\r\n\r\n\u2022\tDecentralizing and compartmentalizing a highly efficient and effective Legal, HR, Facilities, safety, Security, Office Services, and Food Services organization (disguised to Wall Street as \u201csynergies\u201d).  What was told to Broadcom SGA to \u201cfight for you jobs because layoffs will be from AVAGO and Broadcom\u201d was a blatant lie.  The plan has been all along to simply buy (the larger) Broadcom and overburden the current AVAGO SGA team with running it.  No upscaling of their personnel and resources, just \u201cdo more work and be glad to have a job\u201d.\r\n\u2022\tEliminating the Broadcom Foundation and replacing it with a stripped down/gutted excuse of what it was\r\n\u2022\tEliminating the global command center which not only provided 24/7 monitoring of each office globally at a minuscule $200k/year, but also was the core of Broadcom security audit and regulatory requirements.\r\n\u2022\tTo the surprise of the entire company, all current and historical emails are deleted on Feb 1st, with only 7 days advance notice.  Regardless of how business units utilized the current email system in their process workflows, they are not given any time to transition to a new service and adapt to change.  All of that data and records are simply gone.\r\n\u2022\tAt the largest corporate campus (Irvine), there will be no more security front gate, no vehicle controls, no stopping anyone from entering at will and doing whatever they please in the parking lot (which houses cars well over $100k in value) or even entering the office buildings.
