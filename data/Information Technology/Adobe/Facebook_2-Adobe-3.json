Over the last year I have seen a complete turnaround in the organization and Moral across the sales team. I am looking for other positions within Adobe and outside of Adobe and most of the people that I speak with within the inside sales org are doing the same.

I'm not sure if it has to do with a culture rooted in PDF and form handling, but Adobe moves in a very slow and bureaucratic fashion.  Execs like to say it's a \"conservative\" culture --but on a day-to-day basis it just feels like I work for General Motors or some mega-corp.\r\n\r\nAdobe's future is questionable. They continue to do a great job extracting revenue from their existing products, but have repeatedly failed to re-invent themselves or develop a new major revenue stream.  At this rate they are destined to end up more like Xerox or Kodak than IBM or GE.  Right now they are stuck operationally, and strategically as a packaged channel software company. This makes exploring new business models (SaaS, Enterprise, etc.) nearly impossible despite a rhetorical ethos of innovation.\r\n\r\nPromotions are hard to come by at Adobe.  They fancy themselves a very flat organization and it's nearly impossible to get promoted to Director or VP.  This flat org approach means the opportunity for career advancement are very limited.  It also means that Adobe has a strange hero-worship for their executives. Coming from Macromedia, where our execs were just normal people (though often very bright), this is pretty weird.\r\n\r\nAdobe doesn't value intellect in hiring or promoting.  They would much rather bring in a hired gun (castoff) from another tech company , with a mediocre resume, versus promoting or developing internal candidates of promise. This has played out time and time again, with employees leaving, and re-joining several years later in order to get a promotion.  It also plays out daily in terms of work interactions, where I'm forced to deal with people that just aren't very bright.  \r\n\r\nLast off, Adobe's best asset (work-life balance) is also one of it's major drawbacks.  For the most part, employees don't feel a sense of ownership or a strong desire to do the right thing for the customers or the business.  There is a fairly pervasive \"punch-the-clock\" mentality.  The \"that's not my job\" and \"that decision is above my paygrade\" attitudes are rampant throughout the company.  It reminds me of when I worked in a factory full of teamsters.  Punch in at 8, punch out at 5, do your job and nothing more, and do anything possible to avoid extra work.

I direct my comments to you though (please take as many grains of salt as your parent's insurance-provided-doctor prescribes).  \r\n\r\nYou'll notice the other reviewers' chief complaint is with our Sr. dictat... I mean  director... to summarize, he has no successful previous sales experience, has insulated himself with a thick layer of mid-level management, armed himself with a fleet of analysts, doesn't listen to any of his more experienced line managers, and targets people who challenge him then warns others to not ask \"career limiting questions.\" He tries to come across as genuine but is basically a male version of Dolores Umbridge.\r\n\r\nSo how does a marketer take control of an inside sales organization? \r\n\r\nThe key is to remember that most of the roles in this org involve finding prospective buyers and setting up demos for our sales team. There are a few roles where you work with an AE to close small deals but these are difficult to work your way into and frankly the juice isn't really worth the squeeze once you make it into that. So more than likely you aren't in \"Sales\" (from Adobe's perspective). Sure -- you are developing valuable skills for your future as a sales professional, and many very successful salespeople cut their teeth in this org, but from Adobe's perspective you are a lead generator (not unlike a marketing email, display ad, paid search term, etc).  Ultimately, a cost of sales -- and costs are meant to be lowered -- which is exactly what the Sr. Director spends most his time on. \r\n\r\nThat's how a marketer takes over an inside sales org. Because somebody who spends more time with spreadsheets then people thought they could lower cost of sales and manage people like a marketing campaign- while simultaneously preparing them for sales careers. \r\n\r\nHopefully Adobe wises up, replaces top leadership with actual sales professionals who can groom the next generation, and stop the hemorrhaging of great sales talent leaving in droves. \r\n\r\nThat being said, maybe you will be the transfusion to replace the lost life blood of inside sales...  About 15 spots have opened up and there are a lot more coming soon (like empty first class rooms on the sinking Titanic).

This is expectation is regardless of a consultant's experience, skills and ambitions or at what level they were brought in to do the job in the first place. Basically, if you are on a project, forget about growth.

All requests for training either internal or external will be met with \"maybe we can organise an internal enablement session within the team\" or simply a \"no\". Within Adobe, there is an internal multi-solution architect training programme which most senior consultants will naturally aspire to. This is an intensive programme and management expectation is that this is done totally off the back of your own time. Basically, for six months you will have no weekends or evenings.

You guessed it, the only difference is that you bring in more revenue for the company. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement:\r\nThere is no transparency in decision making by the management. It's a blackbox! Check-in and feedback process is a complete farce and is a compliance pretence.  There is a pseudo management structure which distances the real management tier even further.

Isolation, 2. Offshoring.\r\n\r\nIsolation \r\n\r\nRegarding isolation, this applied to me and my \"coworkers\", but I think others at Adobe were well-integrated with a team. So my experience in the group I worked in could have been unique. But small teams and geographically-distributed teams are subject to LOTS of isolation. In the 3+ years I worked there, I worked in three different physical office buildings, and moved my desk four times. I worked for four different bosses in three remote locations. Most of all, the people I worked with on a day-to-day basis were also geographically dispersed, and, with me moving around a lot, and other people sitting around me moving around, I never felt a sense of community. The people in the desks near me were not on my team and I didn't work with them. Often they were a bit stuck-up, or unfriendly, or from a sales culture that emphasized a \"dressy business casual\" attire for some reason, which was at odds with my more casual garb (despite the fact they were not customer-facing). Moreover, they had little interest in technical subjects, and therefore encounters were often awkward. I always felt under-dressed, but I had no reason to dress up in my role. \r\n\r\nOur group had lots of turnover, so there were constantly new and/or different individuals I worked with. I therefore felt physically isolated, and, a bit psychologically isolated because our team was relatively small and not well-known within Adobe and with customers.\r\n\r\nLastly, there was no good reason given for why I was moved around so much. I almost felt it was at the whims of facilities and/or management.\r\n\r\nOffshoring\r\n \r\nAdobe uses offshoring aggressively for certain teams and I'm not sure why. It didn't work in my department. Resources in India were poorly trained (if at all), stuck in their ways, very bureaucratic, and under the tight control of another managerial organization, so they had little, if any, incentive to work together or get ideas/insight from their counterparts in North America. Most importantly, I found most of my working time spent fixing or redoing a lot of work that was of poor quality that was previously performed by offshore resources. Offshore teams went through significant turnover, but were still firmly in place, even in positions of authority when I left, with a regular set of newcomers to replace people that had resigned or moved to another department. Offshore teams were often extremely slow and error-prone in their work, and often made very bad decisions about processes and tools that had very negative consequences.\r\n\r\nConclusion \r\n\r\nAdobe has lots of great people and products. Unfortunately, in my case, my team at Adobe suffered from much political \"power trips\", isolation, hierarchical, and top-down approaches, and \"upper level\" teams with \"carte blanche\". These people are self-proclaimed experts that will look down at you, always find fault with your work, give no thanks for the hard work and struggles that you do, and generally try hard to bully and make life miserable for you, simply because you are \"below\" them. \r\n\r\nBe careful working at this company. It's a big company, so others' experiences could be more positive. But mine and others were not so pleasant. If you work with offshore teams or in a small or little-known group/department, watch out. The fancy buildings, fancy food, and benefits are nice, but when you are isolated and not respected for your work, that negates all the good things at Adobe."}, {"review_title": "Once a great company, now on decline", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Dec 2010", "job_title": "Computer Scientist in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It offers a generous personal space with individual offices, co-workers are great; people you'd like to hang out with after work.

Like Microsoft, Adobe wants to extend into \"the Enterprise\"market - but in my opinion lacks the ability to execute like a 'real' Enterprise Software company.  This is because they have a legacy and heritage as a Desktop Software company, and this pervades every aspect of their culture and go-to-market approach.

Certainly the benefits and the stock plan are excellent.  The company \"cares\" about its employees and continually offers great incentives to them.  The vacation benefits in particular are amazing.  It's quite hard to feel chained to your desk when you have many weeks of time off, and a sabbatical at regular intervals in your career.  Management is often very flexible in allowing for additional work/life balance.\r\n\r\nAdditionally there are very many innately solid and smart individuals working for Adobe, and a good number of truly passionate individuals with deep industry knowledge.  The culture at Adobe is collaborative, which is a way of saying that mutual respect and generally being \"nice\" is considered virtuous.  The executives are not fearsome tyrants; although some have had serious ADD, they are often receptive and genuine on an interpersonal level.\r\n\r\nI do believe that Adobe authentically has set high standards for itself and attempts to deal straightforwardly with its employees and its customers.  The company's core values are laudable, as is their visible commitment (very much so now with the wind spires in the San Jose office!) to conservation, energy efficiency, and community involvement.", "cons": "Adobe as a company faces tremendous challenges in both its culture and its business.  The core business, Creative Suites, seems to have eroded somewhat in the last few years, and no clear vision has arisen to take its place.   Instead the company has resorted to brutal cost cutting measures, while making very few real changes in its internal culture or its business model.\r\n\r\nThe peanut butter analogy that was so famously applied to Yahoo years ago applies equally to Adobe today.  The only real difference between the companies seems to be the monopolistic lock that Adobe has on its highly profitable but aging core businesses.  But that doesn't make the company immune to the erosion of its culture or its values, and ultimately, its stock price.\r\n\r\nAnd the culture that I described above as having so many positive attributes, I'm sorry to say, is the cause of Adobe's downfall.  The management structure is byzantine.  In my business, real communication up the chain was non-existent.  Largely this is because the company adopted rigid processes for software development that silo people away from one another.  The notion of a bunch of smart people sweating it out in a room with a whiteboard, trying cool stuff, and then putting in the pain and tears and blood to make a new product is largely non-existent there.  It's been replaced by bulleted lists, emails, calendars, and a low level of scrutiny into the day-to-day work habits and abilities of individuals.  Getting along matters the most at Adobe; its collaborative culture encourages not making waves.  Just work with the process, get things done, and you're secure.  Cash in your stock, and move on to the next project.  Take a nice vacation if you're feeling a little burned out.\r\n\r\nThis kind of job cannot exist for very long in the tech industry.  The proof is in the pudding.  At Adobe there is a furious pace of offshoring and layoffs.  Yet the culture doesn't change.  People still while away hours in unproductive, mind-numbing meetings.  Managers don't communicate with individuals except via email or rigidly scheduled and over-produced \"all hands\" meetings.  \r\n\r\nOf course I am describing my experience in one business at Adobe.  But I did have direct experience working with other businesses as well.  In my time there i saw inconsistency in how different businesses are managed.  Creative Suites and the Platform teams seemed to be pretty tight ships, by comparison, so some of the above may not apply.  But even then the management structure and lack of communication created huge delays in product development, as well as the creation of ill-concieved \"peanut butter\" products that only went halfway in meeting a real market need.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I want to touch on what is the most damning fact of Adobe's culture and what should cause most employees there to worry, especially the executive team:\r\n\r\nThere is simply no common idea of what Adobe is, what it does, and what it will be doing in the future.  Here's evidence:  the CTO barely has anything to do with Creative Suites, in spite of it being 2/3 of the company's business!  \r\n\r\nWhat is Adobe's technology vision?  What is its real core mission?  What business models will sustain it in the future?\r\n\r\nToday it seems to be:  release CS5 and pray it outsells CS4.  Go half-in on a broad base of satellite products that may or may not be well-conceived.  Continue supporting the Flash albatross and AIR.  To what end?  Revenue growth?  Good karma?  Who knows?  Was buying Omniture, a money-losing business, for a tremendous amount of money a good idea?  What core vision did it fit into?\r\n\r\nI know it's a Valley cliche, but Adobe really needs a lot of that Vision Thing.  And soon.

The only real incentive to run a renewal (which should be the responsibilty of renewals/CSM team) is to not lose the account and therefore not have a minus number against your target before you get going.

Teams like CloudEngg/TechOps, EIS, Shared services etc under infrastructure/ops have very closed and old fashioned management style. The claimed software teams within CloudEngg are not truly focussed on SW, rather a mix of Ops with some development of internal tools. Tech is considered as a mere tool to serve business. Passion for science and technology is diminishing. Tech-stack is almost 2 years behind some of its competitors in the industry. The team is not solving any major industry challenge or have strong visibility inside Adobe.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost 20-50% of staff is contractual, based on team type. They are given left-over work and lack job stability. I have seen a person got fired without any discussion or explanation, and another leaving because of Manager's attitude. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe culture lacks inspiration and trust. Logical reasoning with manager is taken as insult. Speaking your mind is not encouraged. Engineers are more of a labour and have little respect. No respect of Adobe's global policies as well. During paternal leave, a full-time engineer was asked to provide a replacement despite 3 months prior communication of leave plan. Absolutely unethical manager and higher authorities. Every failure in planning is attributed to one or the other engineer or PgM or Product, safeguarding the manager. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy advise : Avoid if you have better offers with other teams or companies. Join only if you have less than 3 YOE (effective) and want to quickly learn OR if you are looking for less-challenging retirement years and have no problem with mundane work under a dud management. For others, you will have to work with a sham of a Manager. The feedback channel is closed in case you don't get along. Besides there is no point when your manager is a neighbour of his manager.

THINK AGAIN!\r\n\r\nAdobe has this rotting division called Adobe Global Services (AGS) / Global Delivery Center (GDC). People are currently unaware of this and the recruiters lure job seekers with the tag name of Adobe. And once they join, they realize they were better off joining TCS or Infosys as this service division at Adobe stands no where close to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst and Foremost - THIS IS NOT AN ADOBE PRODUCT DIVISION!\r\n\r\nSalary Structure-\r\nIts a Joke, you would be given a package which includes 15 to 20% variable. The variable is paid every quarter, and it is tagged to you being billed more than 80% of your time in projects, if you go below that your variable component paid to you is zero. Yes, that's right, this is a services division, hence you have BILLABILITY!\r\n\r\nDivision-\r\nThis is a services division, you need to maintain 9 hours of time everyday, work from home is a joke, it doesn't exist. You are forced to show 'billability' for atleast 80% for a quarter. You go below that and your variable component is not paid to you. Billability is where you are tagged to a project, and getting a project is another joke here. AGS has no projects at all and the managers's billability is decided based on their reportees's and hence they would put you in any work so as to save themselves. Since they hardly have any projects, more than 90% of the folks loose their variable amount. Even if there's a project, you have loads of political vultures who would fight for it so as to get some billability.\r\n\r\nThere's a notorious saying in this division - People would even make you drive cabs if some one promises some billability in that.\r\n\r\nLeadership-\r\nWhat do you expect from a leader who cant even talk in english properly? Whose growth for a division is based on increasing head counts and not results? Lesser said, the better.\r\n\r\nFacilities-\r\nTill now AGS was allowed to sit with some of the best minds of Adobe in the same building, but very soon they are going to be kicked out to a different building. God forbid the employees, With a strength of 300+ people, if there are only 25 car parks and 50 bike parks available, no cab facilities, this gives you a clear picture about how important AGS/ GDC is for Adobe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Not to Fall for this Trap?\r\n\r\nIf you have a Interview call from Adobe:\r\n\r\n1. Ask for the division name from the recruiter? Does she say AGS/ AEM Consulting/ GDC or Practise (New one to lure bakras)? If yes, you can hang up immediately!\r\n\r\n2. Is the recruiter hesitant to share the Job Description? Does she keep postponing it? Hang up!\r\n\r\nIf you have an offer letter already:\r\n\r\n1. Look for your job role, Does it end it Consultant? Like Associate Consultant, Tech or Senior Tech Consultant? Reject the offer! If its Adobe, they would take you as an MTS or as a Computer Scientist, Anything with Consultant is a trap!\r\n\r\n2. Look for your office location or your interview location, Is it not Prestige Tech Park Kadubeesanahalli? Reject! As AGS will be kicked out in about 2 weeks from the day this review has been written.\r\n\r\n3. Were the interviews relatively easy? Do you feel you got into Adobe without much efforts? Reject! They don't have talented folks in AGS to interview anyone :-)\r\n\r\n4. Were you not given stocks? Reject!

There are no leaders in management, though they have the titles, they cannot do their jobs because their leader appears to be dishonest, condesending and threatened his entire org during the most recent all-hands meeting, to not ask \u201ccareer limiting questions,\u201d regarding their quotas going up 40% to 125%. Any managers that challenge his ideas are pushed out. His pride is killing Inside Sales at Adobe.\r\n\r\nEmployees aren't heard, valued or respected. Twelve (12) from Inside Sales have left in the past month, but whats scarier is the amount of people actively looking. When it==the max exodus occurs they won\u2019t care, but they won\u2019t even see if coming because they think all is well in Zion. There are many more that will be gone by the Summer. Our leadership actually reached out to another local company that hired some of the Adobe employees, and demanded that company end existing interviews with all Adobe employees. The evdence is the emails that company sent to the interviewing Adobe employees. HR violation or not, that\u2019s how this leadership behaves. They don\u2019t listen and they think they can solve problems, but with no sales leaders in upper management they often misdiagnose the problem and the solutions just compound problems. This is not just a Lehi problem as two from San Jose left in the last two weeks. Our leadership will handpick specific people and situations and use that best case scenario as the typical example of how things should work every single time.\r\n\r\nLeadership has raised quota 4 times mid-year in the last 22 months. Once you hit your number, they move the number back then brag about how they removed the cap that the last leader had. We miss that guy. After one such quota change they retroactively took money from an entire team of ADMs, totaling thousands per ADM. Retroactive folks! He has taken away entire revenue streams, not paid out spiffs, forced ADMs to compete against the field team and doesn\u2019t provide cover over the top when we attempt to execute his plan against our field teams. We have \u201cnew quality standards\u201d that are simply just busy work for him to report up some awesome new changes. All of this would be fine if we were being compensated properly to deal with his drama, but production has fallen off a cliff and he bragged that gives him more credibility as a leader. He may be delusional, narcissistic or just threatened by A+ players. I will admit, I\u2019m not a doctor. I have heard comparisons to Lord Farquad, but I have not seen the movie Shrek, so I cannot comment. During our company Christmas party one of the white elephant gifts was rolls of toilet paper with his likeness custom printed on the ultrasoft. Many fought over that gift. During one exit interview he was called out on his threat to the org regarding \u201ccareer limiting questions\u201d and he denied ever making that comment. He forgot its recrded and that it was attended by nearly 150 people. It\u2019s also cute that he personally posted a positive review of the great job he\u2019s doing here at Adobe, lol. Now he has the other Inside Sales managers posting positive reviews on Glassdoor. Now you know you\u2019re desperate\u2026"}], [{"review_title": "Overall good company.
