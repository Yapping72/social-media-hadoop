Executive leadership is all in California resulting in insular thinking and is clearly being more open about their support of left-leaning politics. My peers in other locations feel our leaders lack awareness of different perspectives, lifestyles and experiences of employees across the United States. Being in CA myself its harder to understand this but in recent months I can see what they're talking about. Examples include Adobe's prompt action to subject itself to President Biden's ETS vaccine mandate seemingly before the ink had dried. During my team here Adobe has never, I repeat, NEVER been a front-runner on any issues involving difficult decisions and significant change... but rather we conservatively and prudently wait to see what other major tech players do along with the consequences, and then follow suit or act differently if appropriate. In the case of ETS, many other tech companies and large employers are waiting for this controversial issue to play out in the courts and ultimately the Supreme Court before imposing what can be such a life/career-changing requirement on their employees. But contrary to the Adobe I've grown to love, it feels its appropriate to force all employees - remote or not - to vaccination NOW regardless of current and future court outcomes. And another example: occasionally, we deliberately 'over-rotate' with our diversity and inclusion efforts resulting in obvious reverse discrimination in our hiring practices and development opportunities, but leadership casually sweeps it under the rug. Its painful to write such a review about a company with 9 great things to every 1 drawback, but these drawbacks are inexcusable and SO uncharacteristic of our Adobe-4-All mantra."}, {"review_title": "BDR Life", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Business Development Representative in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fantastic company with great benefits", "cons": "Low commission and intricate products"}, {"review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Feb 2022", "job_title": "CS1", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice environment (also dependent on team)\r\nAs a developer options to choose if you want to work on a particular tech.", "cons": "Not very happy when compare CTC to in-hand (depends individually)"}, {"review_title": "Great work life balance, slow promotions", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Credit Risk Analyst in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work life balance\nLaya healthcare\nWellness reimbursement of 600 Euro per annum\nEducation fund that can be approved my manager", "cons": "Overshadowed by the American Offices as senior management is there\nhard to develop professionally/financially\ninflation raises that don't match inflation!"}, {"review_title": "Employee friendly company policies", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Noida", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It all depends on which project you're working in and how your manager treats you.

My experience at Adobe has been so poor. After reading my examples below, you may ask yourself, \"Why not go somewhere else?\" My answer is that if this is as good as it gets, there is nowhere that will be better than Adobe and that is why I am still here.\r\n\r\nExamples: \r\n1. Myself and others were misleveled upon acquisition and have been essentially told to \"deal with it.\" In regards to pay, a female manager alerted Adobe she was underpaid not only at her level, but at the level below her, and was told to be grateful for what she has and that no laws had been broken. Many people have given Adobe the opportunity to make things right since the acquisition, myself included, and Adobe has refused each time. \r\n2. There is a toxic, White, patriarchal culture that is pervasive throughout Utah. It exists at Adobe Lehi. White men hire white men and are offended (and retaliate) when diversity concerns are raised.\r\n3. The ERC does not take employee concerns seriously. It is well known, and openly discussed, that you should not surface concerns to that organization. The default is inaction. I know several people who are considering their legal options to get concerns addressed. Note: If you are a current employee reading this and you have to go to the ERC, please document all interactions with them and avoid meeting in person. Better yet, go directly to your HR Business Partner.\r\n4. Male leaders are not punished for their sexist behavior. When reported to their superiors, they tell us things like, \"He's better than he was,\" and, \"He's just lonely. Cut him some slack.\"\r\n\r\nTLDR; When you have enough resources, you can make anything look better than reality. I believe that is what Adobe does. Investing resources into community events, internal groups, etc. is insufficient when you are unwilling to do the work to create a truly healthy work culture. I know I speak for other women at Adobe Lehi when I say we want to be paid and leveled fairly, treated with respect, and listened to when serious issues occur."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "23 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Writer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits like flexibility of work", "cons": "Not many career growth opportunities"}, {"review_title": "Good benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good pay and benefits", "cons": "Not enough support with management"}, {"review_title": "One of the Best Work Culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jan 2022", "job_title": "MTS-2 Software Engineer in Noida", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay is no more as per the market standard", "cons": "Everything is fine except the pay"}, {"review_title": "Amazing Company to work with", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "10 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Senior Technical Consultant in Noida", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "everything is great here except Managers perception.", "cons": "No Cons apart from Managers perception"}, {"review_title": "Career opportunities", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Senior Financial Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wide variety of jobs to pick from, good opportunities for job rotation, enlargement and job enrichment if you are willing to rotate among teams while maintaining the same level, role and position.", "cons": "Finance team is one of the least happy places in the company due to aggressive management style, formal communication and lack of investment into team building activities and staff development.

Repetitive tasks.\r\n\r\nii. On the job learning opportunities are less unless you're in specialisation track - monitoring, splunk, servicenow. \r\n\r\niii. Its a support and operations job.\r\n\r\niv. Due to a shift in automation in AEM offering through cloud-as-a-service model, the job role of CDE will not exist in near future. At best you will be retained into some specialisation track. \r\n\r\nv. The growth is very poor.\r\n\r\nvi. The mid-level management is hostile. E.g. you might not believe this - if your laptop stops working for some reason then you're responsible to sort it out with IT ASAP. You'll be held responsible for any delay. Managers will dump their frustration on you like its your fault.\r\n\r\nvii. You can be targeted and indirectly forced into certain specialisation track and in projects for which no documentation exists. A strict timeline will be imposed during which you'll need to learn everything and start contributing to the projects in addition to your already existing regular workloads. Even if its unrealistic and for some reason you fail to deliver, you'll be put on PIP without appraisals. You'll not be allowed to provide any justification from your side.

Marketo CSMs are treated like secondhand citizens, your compensation will be lower than what you see listed for an Adobe CSM and if you are not Enterprise you will have an aggressive and arguably unattainable sales goal. This isn't truly Customer Success, it is sales and do not let them tell you it isn't. They have also implemented a new \"level\" system that makes it so they can tell you you are getting promoted without actually giving you any title change or any significant compensation increase. \r\n\r\nManagement plays favorites and is extremely cliquey. If you aren't meeting quota you will be treated like scum and if you are meeting quota they will treat you like you got lucky and that you better double it or else. They create a toxic environment of competition between the employees and there is a real high school mean girl mentality with a lot of the CSMs and if you are not in their inner circle you will get to look forward to snide comments about your performance, looks, or really anything they can come up with to try and knock you down a peg. I know several people, including myself, had to start going to therapy to deal with the environment. Thank god Adobe benefits cover it! I still flinch at the sound of a Slack notification from the issues with this team. \r\n\r\nThere is also no official training and you can go your entire career here never actually getting into the product. I literally have never actively been inside the Marketo product, they do not even give CSMs a demo environment to test in or be trained at all. The one silver lining in that mess is that you have an SC team that knows what they are doing. I have never worked with more capable people than the people on that team and they can cover you for demos, but it needs to be tied to a new money deal, not troubleshooting with a customer or helping them understand a product they maybe just purchased. \r\n\r\nMy advice to people who just want a foot into Adobe, join Marketo it's less competitive than the other products, but keep in mind that management isn't on your side to jump to other teams so if you can network under the radar that's your only chance. They don't want to lose anyone because turnover is already bad. I watched them lose a lot of amazing top performers to other companies because of this. Your opinion doesn't matter here, but the rest of Adobe seems to actually care about career growth."}, {"review_title": "Adobe", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "1 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best place to work and a dream company", "cons": "No Cons as such here"}], [{"review_title": "Sales", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Business Development Representative in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits\nGreat people\nGreat pay\nGreat work environment \nCollaboration", "cons": "Long interview process \nQuick onboarding process"}, {"review_title": "Great WLB", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great WLB and perks too,", "cons": "Nothing I can think of"}, {"review_title": "Employee friendly company with good acquisition DNA", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 May 2021", "job_title": "Director of Product Management", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Adobe does a great job on acquiring the right companies.

Most of time you will have 4-5-6 projects in your bucket and you will not get time for yourself. You will be working extended hours daily to achieve your billing target.\r\n\r\n* Your manager will ping/call you many times a day to check if you are able to achieve billing target. Keep in mind even if you are assigned to a project you can only bill that customer if there is some work assigned to you by customer for that particular week.\r\n\r\n* Projects are very short term(not more than 3-4 months). \r\n\r\n* There is no development work in consulting. If you are a developer, do not join here.\r\n\r\n* People are arrogant here in this practice. No one will help you if you are new. They will not even reply over chats.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Even If you are new to Adobe tools, they will give you few weeks of training that is of no use. And ten they will assign you individual project with customers that too multiple projects. If anything goes wrong they will put all blame on you. There is no planning for resource management. To get money from customer they will not even listen to your issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot sure if all this is known to leadership team of Adobe or not. \r\n\r\nSo during interview double check with HR which department you are going to join.

On top of this, patches are changing every 3-6 months, making the likelihood of running an enterprise sales cycle very low.
