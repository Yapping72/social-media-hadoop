If you think engineers with impossible deadlines should be given ten year old, entry level PCs with 2GB of memory to build a million line code base, while managers should be given i7 laptops with 32GB and SSDs so that their PowerPoint presentations run quickly, this is the place for you. The company asks you to like them on Facebook, and then blocks Facebook, that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nIn case you want to know what you're in for if you join, this was my first week:\r\n\r\nAfter going to first day orientation with HR, we (engineering new hires) then had a meeting with our team's manager (or maybe the director, it wasn't clear). This was a second orientation, which seemed to duplicate the first one, except almost all the policies had different content now, completely contradicting what we'd been told by HR. When this was pointed this out, we were told to refer to the \"official\" policies. They said that all of the official policies are the intranet but no one seemed to know where, and no one could find them. And we couldn't find them because IT had not given new hires intranet access. Apparently it's not really important, and we were that \"no one really follows policies here anyway\".\r\n\r\nFrom there, I got to my desk, where I had an entry level PC from around 2008. I thought it was a mistake, but I was told I should actually consider myself lucky, since I had a full 8GB of memory. A low-end i3 with 8GB of memory is considered a high end development machine here, apparently. Until they upgraded to Windows 7 last year (and some people are still using XP), the average machine was a supposedly only a Core Duo with 2-3GB. Our manager was actually bragging that \"everyone in the department now has at least 4GB of memory\", as if this is considered cutting edge. The sad thing is, as far as Thales goes, that's probably right.\r\n\r\nMy PC wasn't even set up with the required developer tools. There was no compiler, no access to source control system, or any of the other required systems. The PCs are locked down (no administrator rights, no installation rights, restricted network access, disabled USB ports), so you can't install anything yourself, you have to have IT do the installations, and it takes weeks of running around to get that to happen.\r\n\r\nThe next problem was researching the problems online, but IT blocks so many web sites, it's nearly impossible to find anything (technical blogs and discussion forums are all blocked), so we were using our phones to research how to fix these problems, because there was no other way to access the internet.\r\n\r\nSo many of us were having problems that management responded by calling a meeting, but all they did was tell us that it was our responsibility to get our systems working, and that we can't use the fact that we don't have usable computers \"as an excuse\". And then we all were warned not to \"waste time\" on phones during working hours, and told we would be reprimanded if they saw us using our cell phones.\r\n\r\nDespite all that, if you can get a working system, hole yourself up in the engineering area, and avoid management as much as possible, there's some really interesting work, and you can learn a lot."}, {"review_title": "Looks good on the surface, once you see inside is a different story.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Contracted Media Technician in Melbourne, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, PTO mirror that of European packages.", "cons": "Management lacks creativity and becomes threatened by new blood.

It was more of an omission of information rather than a boldface lie.  Even the recruiter downplayed some of the key negative issues which i list in the CONS.  THe salary was comparable to my position and the benefits were average but expensive.  Although the PTO they offer right away is 4 weeks (because of the french parent conpany), you likely wont get to take all at first  because there are so many old-timers there who will get first preference.  So if you don't use it, you lose it.  The PTO issue is actually a con also as several key roles are always missing at meetings or for approvals because everyone is always on PTO.  I'm not sure how this division makes any money.  THe only other good thing is location is good and close to alot of restaurants which is important as they don't have a real cafeteria only a small room in each building with refrigerators/microwaves.  \r\n\r\n2  People:  The only best thing about this location is that even thought the politics are typical, there are a whole lot of really nice people who have the best of intentions (thought not really exceptionally skilled).  So if you enjoy a friendly environment, where you might shine above the crowd if you have super skills, then you will thrive here as you could get your work done in no time and kick back the rest of the time.", "cons": "THis llst could go on perpetually, but I will try to list the most critical issues:\r\n1.  culture:  old aerospace folks who either worked for Boeing, or Parker Hannifin or other aerospacce group; this is an CON becuase this division is more commercial in nature because their product is their content delivery platform for the airplanes (the content video boxes) - so it has nothing to do with Aerospace except it was built in the same plant where they use to build the aeronautics.  This division competes with Panasonice who smokes them because Panasonic understands the commerial arena.  This is definitely going to hold this company back from growing.\r\n2.  Culture again:  this is not a technology hip company.  THey just got smart phones last year and they really do not understand the benefit of them.  (i.e, they don't use then to be efficient).  The Mgt team members all prefer to conduct F2F meetings so that is all they do.  MY director would go to meetings all day long that were mostly update sessions or discussion sessions where nothing got done.  THat is just a French thing where the management teamn likes to debate things forever and over analyze it to death.  This is a big time waster for those who are use to more aggressive, lean, hands on management style that is prevalent these days.  It will be very confusing to younger generation.  I worked with an intern from Cal Poly - and he was a junrior.  He had more technical and critical thinking skills than most of the long term employees I worked with (in the office area not manufacturing).  THis company is definitely not for the creative, innovative types.  \r\n3.  staff augmentation:  they relied heavily on outsource staffing.  That is how they got any talent and most was off-shore so they had cheap rates (but still talented);   you almost feel like you were exploiting them but this seems to be common in what is left of the aerospace companies.  You don't find many 'American's in the engineering teams except for the management, and the entry level folks who don't mind grunt work.  \r\n4.  Salary - I hear from the engineering teams that salaries are lower than the competitive area.  However, in the office positions, you have old-timers that have been there so long that they make really good money plus have 8-10 weeks vacations so they are not going to go anywhere nor do they bring in any new ideas to the table.  THey just do the same think like they always do.\r\n5.  Technology - I mentioned this earlier - they have old fashiion work process that are manual and remind you of the 80's.  you almost expecct to see green screen monitors and green striped computer reports.  Again, it reminds me of old aerospace environment which I do happen to have a little experience with when I interned at Lockheed in the mid 80's.  THis place looks and acts the same - very surreal now that it is 30 years later.  THey finally are getting an ERP (SAP) system installed, but they have no clue how it will happen.   It took 3 weeks to get a laptop, and a month to get me a smartphone , though the request had been in the system for over 2 weeks.  I was told that it was actually quick for me.  Go figure.  THey had very locked down security that was very proprietary as most of it was implemented in France where it seems that they are not very hip on basic things like ENcryption.  Yes, security should always be an issue, but there are plenty of fortune 100 companies who have figured it out without impeding their employees abilities to do their work.  \r\n6..  Overall:  because of the manual processes, and constant meetings culture, this organizatin can not respond quickly and alienated their suppliers.  Generally, everyone just develops an apathetic, tolerant view of things.  If you are a go-getter, you will be miserable here like I was.  No one really expects you to get things done, and if you do, you likely had to steam roll someone.  THere is always too much work again because of the old fashion internal business processes.  it feels very much like a government agency.  The culture is also very much a good 'ol boys environment but not even a current version of it,  atleast in today's hi-tech companies if you are a smart female, you get tolerated by the men, but here, you just get ignored unless you are attractive (which does help)."}, {"review_title": "Your Mileage May Vary (Mine Was Excellent)", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Dec 2012", "job_title": "Legal Department in Arlington, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting/sophisticated work; empowered to make important decisions; international travel (Paris); good work/life balance; market compensation; pleasant colleagues (some awesome, none awful); good immediate boss.", "cons": "Currently a transitional environment because of organizational changes at Group and US HQs (impacts morale and job security); ocasional cultural gaps between French and US management (never a problem for me)."}, {"review_title": "Systems Engineer for Thales", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Sept 2013", "job_title": "Systems Engineer in Colombes", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting project\r\nGood atmosphere\r\nGood Life Balance\r\nGood company benefits\r\nGood amount of training possible", "cons": "Huge hierarchy\r\nNo mentoring\r\nGlass ceiling\r\nSalary\r\nNo real international mobility"}, {"review_title": "Sales Manager", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Oct 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent company to learn and grow in.
