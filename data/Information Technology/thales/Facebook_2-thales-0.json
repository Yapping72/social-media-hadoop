It is rare to see at least 3rd generation Singaporean in this company's IT and engineering division. If there are any Singaporeans, they are foreigners who had converted to Singaporean. - Promotion is based on both seniority and pleasing the management / French people rather than merits / skills. The effect is brilliant people leave after about 2-3 years of working and those in technical and management roles are filled with the average or bad ones. - Turnover rate is high and this company even gives 2000 SGD for a successful candidate hiring recommendation, close to what this company gives for a successful patent (1000-1500 EUR). - There are several high-ego managers and toxic colleagues. Sabotage and backstabbing do exist and you will be hardly be able to protect yourself when dealing with these toxic people. See the above 2 points on why this is happening. - Most French colleagues I have worked with are cunning, self-entitled, and arrogant towards Asian. It is hard to identify this since they always appear as very friendly. - Politics are strong in higher managements, especially if it is related to French people. - Not many brilliant people to work with and the experts' expertise are questionable.

Nepotism rules here, not merit or hard work or good results. All senior and management positions are filled by France with French expats, or they will put in a puppet/sycophant to ensure the Aussie workforce do as they are told. Most in these positions feel entitled to talk down to, yell at, berate, belittle and demean their subordinates. It's hard to watch and hard to endure on a daily basis. Sadly this type of behaviour is normalised, and those that behave in this way are often the ones promoted. Other reviews spoke about bullying, it's true and it's rife but nothing is done about it. Consequently a lot of Aussies, or anyone of intelligence, are leaving in droves. Thales doesn't mind, they just bring in more expats from France to backfill or go to the subcontinent. Most employees are now migrants looking to secure PRs. As you can imagine, quality of engineering has gone downhill in a big way. As another review stated, innovative work is only allowed to be done in France. Actually everything we do is dictated from France, which is sad because they don't have a vision for the APAC region. Engineering and technical decisions are made by France, and are driven entirely by cost rather than the merit of the technology or engineering solution. If the solution is not a French solution, you're guaranteed that it will be killed off. It's extremely hierarchical and top-down, no one listens to the actual subject matter experts, and the excuse is always the same - this is a French company, this is the French way, this is the French culture. Really? Working in Melbourne in this day and age??? I've seen good employees being pushed out (I'm pretty sure that's illegal, but Thales is lawyered up and the French don't care about Australian workplace laws), I've seen good employees dismissed because someone higher up got upset and I've seen some people have their roles go offshore. Employees here work crazy long hours and often weekends too, they seriously deserve better. Pay is well below market rates and you fall further behind the longer you stay. Women and minority groups tend to fare worse in salary reviews and professional development opportunities. It's really sad to see what was once a close-knit and innovative Aussie company go this way, but... If you want to do anything of value or worth for society, avoid at all costs. If you value learning, avoid at all costs. If you value your health and wellbeing, avoid at all costs. If you don't want to constantly watch your back and play downright dirty politics, avoid at all costs. If you value autonomy, collaboration, independent thought and having a voice, avoid at all costs.
