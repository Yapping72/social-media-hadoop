You find yourself hoping for VTO(Voluntary Time Off) because you would rather starve or deprive yourself of something than to deal with coworkers and management. They will have you sorting mail that ranges from a little envelope to a 45 lb weight on 3 different lanes during the night shift the volume is in the 100 of thousands and you get like 10 lanes each lane has 2 destinations with 20 different bags on each not including the oversized packages so if you are a \u201cSTOWER\u201d do the math at night shift it is your responsibility to to sort mail for 10 lanes those 10 lanes rep 2 different destinations w 20 bags on each side 20x2x10= 400 bags your responsible for dividing mail into again not including an oversized package that can weigh up to 70 lbs. Safety protocol especially during Covid has been terrible. They hire people to be safety police which their job is to make sure you abide by the 6ft and mask over face rule. That\u2019s fine but its contradicting when these saftey police people talk to one another without their mask on closer than 6 ft. These safety police people are basically another outlet for management to haggle regular associates because their position is distinguished by a different color vest so basically if you your vest has stripes it gives you the right to not wear your mask or be closer than 6 ft. Then of course this is your job all day and the people they give these jobs are the people that was shown favoritism And did nothing when they were regular associates. Another sign that they don\u2019t care about your safety they allow delivery vans within the warehouse which they\u2019re are stop signs ON THE WALK PATH! so basically it\u2019s to say a 20,000 pound DELIVERY VAN has the right of way to walk instead of a human in Amazon eyes. They actually have associate that will stop you so the van can come inside think about it if your on the street a crosswalk guard mostly stop vehicles so the pedestrian can walk not in Amazon culture the delivery van has higher hierarchy than an associate. They don\u2019t treat the drivers well either they rush them to get routes by yelling at them telling them they can\u2019t take bathroom breaks at times. The people they assign on the pods, again regular associates that got favoritism did nothing that are promoted to a position to do what? Yes nothing. Their job is to help the drivers with their route but you will have a driver come up to you a person staging your route to ask the location of their route. So factor that in Amazon has employed a person to yell at this driver be the leader of the pod where their routes or staged but between these people the driver has to find an associate in middle of staging a route for assistance. Your schedule requests are never looked at I did a schedule request more than 4 months out it was never even reviewed they have HR in the office which when u go to them with a problem they direct you to the hr telephone number which defeats the point of HR having an office in that building. Back to the Covid procedure lol in the beginning we got hazard pay n unlimited excused absences without being penalized because if you are in fear or you or your family life you shouldn\u2019t be forced to come into a working environment that averaged about 4-5 cases in a day in that one warehouse. The hazard pay and excused absences lasted a month which upon return of the attendance policy they made the policy stricter than before Covid meaning if your one min late you lose an entire hour of your Unpaid Time(the only vacation time you get because again they don\u2019t look at your days off request and during these times there was 0 VTO) you lose an entire hour instead of 1 min which before if you were 1 min late you lost 1 minute of the unpaid time. One of the \u201cCovid\u201d Safety Precautions was that no more than one person can be in an aisle , that has 6 different 6 ft markers down. When your picking a route up to 4 different people can be assigned to this aisle which you watch one person pick their item down the aisle while you wait with the other 3 closer than 6 ft because with route assistance people(people that do nothing but watching how long it takes you to pick a route) and the delivery vans there would be more social distancing office you would allow 3 people in the aisle at the same time seeing as the markers on the ground distinguishes 36 ft between the aisle instead of you trying to find space with 3 people waiting for their turn down the aisle, a delivery van , delivery driver and route assistance person who\u2019s not going to do anything, but stare at a computer screen. They have the capability to supply new sorting devices throughout the warehouse because of outdated ones but don\u2019t put the same attention towards the restrooms as stalls have remained broken for months. Now you would think doing all this Amazon would show some gratuity and compassion to their workers for putting their life physical mental health on the line I was reading the bulletin board where it states that off duty workers have a 10 min limit of being on the premises meaning that if you are in the break room waiting for your Uber or outside waiting for your ride they have an associate That will approach you and ask you to leave the premises if it is longer than a 10 min wait, or if you catch the bus and arrive 30 mins early you have to wait somewhere else than the place your are about to risk your health at to work at. The California labor laws states that you are entitled to 10 min break if you work more than 4 hours on a shift than can be taking in between there has been instances where they have tried to tell me I couldn\u2019t take a break which it never worked because I told them I read and know it\u2019s against the law but I have heard from other associates they have told them the same. The opportunity for growth is very limited they promote the favorites that do nothing or sleep their way into position they turning down people with supervisor experience for 19-20 year fresh fast young girls with weeks of experience lol haha"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "31 Mar 2021", "job_title":
