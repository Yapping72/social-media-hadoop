I was struggling working those 4 12 hour days in the heat, standing/walking on cement..but during peak season, they will give you an entire extra day that you have to be present for. The first year I was there, I was told I couldn\u2019t used my personal time to skip my mandatory days. So I was working 60 hour weeks during the holidays. Then, when business slows down, they had so many people they had hired on as to help during peak season, that they had to MAKE people take time off.
