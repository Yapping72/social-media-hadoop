When I started at Amazon I read the negative reviews and thought I could handle it. I had previously worked for fast paced companies with rank and stack and accountability systems. I did well. However at Amazon the teams and locations that are not even remotely alike are ranked and stacked. Low performers are put on PIP with made up numbers and documentation (there was literally no reporting at employee level). Higher level employees were promoting frequently to different projects so they weren't there to face consequences of this poor direction. \nI worked 60-80 hours a week for years with no end in sight. I regularly received calls while sleeping or on weekends.  \nKeeping talent is unnecessarily difficult.  Leadership promotion opportunities at lower levels heavily favor outside hires to inside promotions and pay 20% more for outside versus internal promotions.  To  the point the people leave for a year or so and then plan to come back for better pay treatment. \nOn a personal note I had the worst experience I ever had from a leader across 20 years of professional experience.  The leader over me was in line for promotion and spent daily public calls berating me and my team.  Everyone who has worked there more than 2 years had a horror story about some previous member of leadership who yelled and cursed at people under them. \nJust like anywhere else your experience depends a lot on your manager. Speaking as someone who was in leadership there is a lot of pressure to write up people and work them out without the supporting due diligence in training and help. Plenty of people work there and love it. I got mental health issues and lasting physical problems.

This results in the vast majority of projects and programs being rolled out with errors, never fully rolled out, or rolled out and pulled back. Meanwhile, the individuals who implement the change are generally long gone with no impact on their own operations or life styles.\r\n\r\nWhile it is a great place to start in the data center industry, Amazon as a whole, has made it clear publicly many times that they are not interested in retaining personnel for long periods of time. That is unless those individuals are high enough on the totem pole. You will find those individuals shake hands and then bounce from Data Center Company to Company, meanwhile leaving their knee jerked reactive programs behind. While they say there are many roles to grow in and expand professionally, this is only a half true statement. Years ago while the company was initially expanding this was wholeheartedly true. However, even though one of their guiding principles is hire and develop the best, when you read between the lines of their programs you will find a very restricted path to get promoted from within the company. Most managers are inexperienced in the cultural ways of Amazon, trying to take care of their own stuff to look good in the eyes of amazon, or they are literally moving around so fast that they don't have time or skills to figure out the companies promotion ladder. This leads to stagnation in regards to in-house promotions and what rewards are finally given to the individuals who are promoted.\r\n\r\nIf you have been working for the company for 3 years and step into a promotion role, everyone they hire off the street (even those with no prior Data Center experience) will be payed more and at a higher overall level in the company than you are. Which then plays back to the management being extremely sub par in regards to their ability to get in-house personnel even promoted up 1 level in the same position (I.E L4-L5 for a Chief Role etc).\r\n\r\nWhile the work environment can be lax, generally in the IAD region it is not. This is due to the continued expansion of the company with its constant attrition rate. EOTs have a high rotation rate into and out of the company. You can really see this just in the base offers that are turned down in lieu of other companies right down the road. When asked at an all hands call what management plans to do in regards to personnel retention with increasing competition and cost of living prices in the given area over the last 3-5 years....to which the response was, \"If you don't like it leave. It is your privilege to work at here.\" As you can imagine that was not happily received throughout the entire Virginia region.\r\n\r\nThe complex problem solving that comes with working here is a real double edged sword. You're blessed and thankful to have something that your brain can pick at and resolve, something that was holding work up not at one site but at multiple sites across the region/continent. However, there is a never ending, growing list of expanding problems to pick at due to the way, as aforementioned, due to the speed of the company, rotation of management and techs, and also the cost at which the company isn't willing to pay at times to ensure certain systems are redundant or have the best components.\r\n\r\nIt's sad to say but Amazon seems to be making it very clear about the direction that it intends to head with its employee care and promotions. It is entirely removing the people aspect out of management. Trackers on employees, its combination of video and facial recognition software, and its heavy, heavy use of being a metric driven company, shows that it is not interested in having employees stay long. Only how long you can hold on for and that you push your hardest until you can't. \r\n\r\nAs I heard an obviously amazing leader (US Navy Commander/ Sub Captain) say, \" Enlisted men are like tools. I use them until they break, and the Government sends me another.\"\r\nSince the Company keeps hiring so many ex-military (officer and enlisted) it's easy to see those transitions into Amazon. I.E.

Big problems - At Amazon, no problem is pushed aside as too hard to solve. In fact, they go after the really hard and insolvable problems and then throw talent, time and resources towards solving them.\n\n2.Ownership - Amazon treats you like an owner - a grown up. You have a job to do and you are empowered to do it. There are checks and balances, of course, but you truly do own your business. You make the assessments, take the risks, justify your decisions and ultimately reap the benefits or learn from your mistakes and move on. There are not many fall-backs and layers to catch you if you are not moving your business forward. Not a lot of finger poitning for failures either, that I saw. In fact, I would say that if you do not act like an owner, you will not be successful at Amazon. You have to embrace the responsibility and run with it.\n\n3. Smart People - You'll hear this a lot and personally, I think some of the talk is overblown but Amazon does indeed have some very, very smart and talented people working there.", "cons": "CONS. \n\n1. Culture - I think some people could have a tough time adjusting to the culture - its tough, expectations are high and there is not always a lot of hand holding ( in fact, it would be very rare). I think you have to embrace or at least accept it and focus on the positives. Your team makes a huge difference - so hopefully you're lucky and end up with a great manager and great team mates. You can end up overworked and resentful if you are not good at prioritizing your work and your life and making trade-offs.\n\n2. People/Politics - I started to see a lot of the \"we are the best in the world\" mentality start to show up. I don't believe that everyone that works at Amazon is a genius and seeing that attitude crop up every now and then was annoying. Every company has inside politics and even though Amazon tries really hard to believe there is no politics, there is certainly that to deal with. No more than any other company that I can tell, but it can get frustrating when you're working so hard and so long to get derailed by that kind of thing."}, {"review_title": "Salary in Ohio", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Truck Driver in Etna, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Home daily, good insurance starting day one, lots of time off and options for time off within first year!
