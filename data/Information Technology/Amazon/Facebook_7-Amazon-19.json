Mandatory overtime, twice or even 3 times a week for 12 hour days. In addition to your regular 3 day week. So... Sometimes there are 6 12 hour shifts. Which might be good for some people.\n\nThey call it the Amazon family, but it may have a closer approximation to Indentured servitude. Just remember you can leave, and it's your decision to. \n\n2.) During (scan-to-scan) breaks You have to run to get to the break room, have some peace and then get back before break is over. \n\nIf you're on the top floor you're mostly out of luck. Because break will be at least half-way over by the time you get outdoors.\n\n3.) Uhh water, the water sytem isn't always working correctly, it may have been fixed since I was there. But when I was, the team didn't always have easy or close access to water. \n\nSo then you'd have to go to a different floor and then you're getting \"time off task\". Which is a performance metric and if it goes too low they'll threaten to fire you... \n\n4.) Management... It really depends, some managers are really cool and understand that it isn't the greatest place to work. \n\nOthers are completely unwilling to listen to anything, no matter how valid your reasoning is. So if the scanner is broken, or the screen or system, or any other thing is malfunctioning... \n\nFind out who can fix it, or who can get someone to fix it. Because they'll blame it on you, and say that it's your fault you can't work. Or your fault for not working. \n\n5.) It's loud. Not too much of a concern for most people, but not great if you're prone to headaches. \n\n6.) The training process is garbage, my trainer went to... \"Get coffee\" and never came back, now that may be just one irresponsible person. But there was no accountability. Which leads to 7 the last one \n\n7.) Communication is absolutely terrible. It took a while to eventually find the head of my department, so that I could be assigned to a different trainer. \n\nIt did eventually happen, but until then I was doing everything wrong and getting messages full of \"lingo\" that I didn't understand... And acronyms that made no sense. \n\nThe whole process was incredibly disorganized, and they won't take any input from employees, because they assume sense they make more money that you're stupid. \n\nAfter seeing how it runs on the inside, It honestly amazes me in every way that Amazon is capable of delivering anything within a month... And Im absolutely not going there again.\n\nOh and also on last thing... They claim to be very... progressive I guess... But none of that relates to actual or truly held values... \n\nIn reality, it's just... Propoganda I guess... Maybe someone up top thinks that if they say pride enough, then you'll eventually believe that it's something they stand for...

Dynamic working culture for you to succeed: It's my first month here at Amazon, and this is what I can foresee if I execute as a humble leader.\n2.

At least the team or org that I stayed, I don't need to worry about making contribution at all during this period of time. It allows me to observe what the team does and how the team does things, also many courses are very useful to help any SDE to become an excellent engineering. It's a great process to help any new member ready and start their journey well.\n3. Very strong competitive salary pay, this is why I switched from Microsoft to Amazon.\n4. Teammates are all very humble and love to help. Everyone here can be considered as a leader, and they are eager to share their knowledge and experience to make you successful as well. I don't find any PIP or competing interests at all.\n5. The culture and working environment expect you to be leader of your own, and make contribution to the team, the org or even broader impact. I would recommend someone who knows what he/she wants, or self-motivated enough to join.

Coding convention: I don't find this as the requirement in our team's development yet, so if you don't have a good coding habit, you would miss the learning opportunities to code collaboratively. This is an important habit in most other software companies.\n3. Documentation wiki or resources: There are very many internal resources and shared folder style of documents, but not as easy as Microsoft, which might because I am new, but I would expect a much better user interface so far at least."}, {"review_title": "Good place", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Tier I Associate in University Park, Optional[IL]", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent pay, easy work, a lot of good people at least in inbound receiving.", "cons": "Its amazon fulfillment, we all know what sucks about amazon fulfillment.

My team (and whole organization) highly values work/life balance and encourages each other to avoid working during off-hours and valuing the personal life balance with work.

This results in good benefits for warehouse workers and drivers, but below the standard for corporate employees. \r\n\r\nBelow are the benefit areas that could use some improvement:\r\n* Company Holidays: Amazon does not offer many holidays each year. For example, Black Friday, Christmas Eve, and New Years Eve are not company holidays. Compared to other large companies that I have worked for, Amazon's company holidays are severely lacking and leave me missing the days around the big holidays because I have work. \r\n* 401K plan match: the Amazon 401K plans do not start matching employee contributions until an employee has worked at the company for 2 years. For such a large company, it is surprising that they don't match some portion of contributions on day one. Most of the companies I have worked at (even retail and small companies) have offered some portion of a 401K match that starts in the first 90 days."}, {"review_title": "Vast opportunities to learn", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Technical Project Manager in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High pace, a lot of work and tons of leaning opportunities", "cons": "Stressed at times when unnecessary escalations are made"}, {"review_title": "Good if you are looking for urgent work", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Warehouse Operative in Manchester, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay and Good place to work if you are looking for urgent work.", "cons": "Bad management, once Amazon starts to have no job, they are getting rid of employees."}, {"review_title": "Mostly good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Customer Operations Associate in Ia\u015fi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Colleagues are friendly, generous and helpful even if you never got a chance to meet them (remote work).
