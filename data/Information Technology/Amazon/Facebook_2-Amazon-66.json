Oddly enough the few 'blue badges' at the facility (those on contract) often seem the most demotivated of the lot. The result is that the majority of the workforce live without much job security, motivation or critically the kind of  in depth knowledge of the company and customer service procedures that you would expect from your seniors.\r\nThe two weeks training new CSAs are put through initially feels like initiation into a cult with endless repetition of meaningless jargon and references to 'Jeff' (Bezos). You almost begin to buy how great Amazon is and how much it truly cares for its staff until the first person in the training class is called out for being five seconds late for break (EVERYTHING is monitored obsessively) and you realize that, yes, you're really expected to leave your desk, go through four swipe checkpoints, queue in the canteen, eat, and return, in the space of fifteen minutes.\r\nThe job was exciting and challenging for about two days while fresh on the 'floor' but then became mind-numbingly boring with the same two or three issues being dealt with continuously. In addition to the overbearing monitoring from anonymous middle managers, the massive reliance on performance statistics, in which negative customer feedback is often unfairly left on the basis of the customer's experience at Amazon (rather than your performance at CSA) becomes a problem, and unpaid overtime soon becoming the norm (any contacts received before the end of your shift must be dealt with before you're allowed leave).\r\nI'm delighted that I've been offered a new permanent position beginning in February as I can't imagine that I would have lasted beyond then otherwise."}, {"review_title": "Chaotic", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Dec 2014", "job_title": "Software Development Manager in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Smart people and good salary for the first two years of employment.", "cons": "Frugal - very little perks.

Not only is it the worst place I have ever worked it is also the worst environment I have ever found myself in. After being thrown in the deep end with absolutely no relevant job training what so ever, micro managed, being spoken to like a child, threatened to be ripped a new 'rear' hole, doing two peoples job and then being told to raise my performance after only having 3-4 lunch breaks in four months I'm afraid to say I've given up and handed my notice in.\r\n\r\nAfter taking a year out to take my masters (as a mature student) I found myself in one of Amazons so called graduate positions. How they call this a graduate position I don't know. There is no training programme what so ever accept an awful week in Luxembourg being patronised with Amazons so called leadership principles and a couple of days working in one of their fulfilment centres (a big warehouse). The training and on job support has been nothing but awful. Some of the managers were so unapproachable they'd talk down to you if you asked a question as if you were magically supposed to know everything already. I read another review that basically says Amazon has grown so quickly people have been promoted to quite senior positions that shouldn't really be there. This is very true. \r\n\r\nI have to hand to Bezos though. He has created one of the most culture-less capitalist work environments I could ever imagine. He's got an army of young people straight out of uni armed with degrees and MBAs who he's willing to use and abuse to satisfy his customer obsession. Along with the agency staff that are treated like rubbish, hired and fired on a daily basis he has feathered his nest very well.\r\n\r\nI could go on all night but let me do you a favour. If your young, ambitious, want an interesting career and above all else have more than an ounce of integrity do not consider a job with Amazon. The last four months have been the worst of my life. I still don't know who I'm more annoyed with. Amazon for treating people like this or myself for letting them threat me like this. The later has been remedied with notice given. One of Amazons leadership principles is \"hire and develop the best\" but come on let's be realistic. If your bright and ambitious your aim in life probably isn't being stuck in a warehouse getting excited about delivering parcels.

We do this for two reasons...  1) retention is horrifically low at fulfillment centers so anything to incentivize tenure (we're not above bribery!).   2) The vast majority of Amazon managers have very short tenures at Amazon, so few make it through to the end of their vesting schedule and they therefor never realize their full compensation.  So it's easy to offer a high rate of pay when one knows most managers will never realize their full compensation.  \r\n  \r\nThe ego boost for working for such a respected brand is enticing.  Amazon is fully aware of this and will leverage it as needed.  \r\n\r\nPromotional opportunities exist if you are willing to relocate.\r\n\r\nYou will work with some really bright folks who are driven and motivated.", "cons": "Be aware of what you see online (Linkedin, Facebook, Web career site, etc.) about community involvement, volunteerism, corprate team building exercises and the 'look at how much fun we are having and how amazing it is to work here!!!' vibe is/are 100% corporate ativities.  They do not exist in the field, in any capacity, whatsoever.  It's simply marketing to entice candidates.\r\n\r\nAmazon is a 24/7/365 business.  So expect to work overnights as well.  Yes the recruiter will deftly avoid answering schedule questions, yes even if you are lucky enough to initially get a coveted day shift.  Yes regardless of your kids, husband/wife's schedule.  Reality is people transfer, resign or get promoted all at breakneck speed at Amazon which means in very short order there will be a vacancy on overnight that needs to be filled...  you can protest but it won't do much good.\r\n\r\nCommunication is sorely lacking.  Communication to help shape a common purpose or best practices or really anything is almost non-existent in the Amazon Fresh business.  It doesn't exist in the business as a whole nor in any building I've worked in.   \r\n\r\nZero work life balance.  I've heard rumors that Jeff Bezos himself said he hates that term.  The culture reflects that.      \r\n\r\nWithin a Fulfillment Center you will never work less than a 12hr day.  My experience is that 14hr-16hr days for myself and my peers is the expectation and the norm.  That is 5 days a week and you can expect your boss to call/email/text you on your days 'off'.   By the way this is in no way tied to a peek season schedule....  this has been the norm my whole time at Amazon whether it's December or June.  Keep in mind that you will be on your feet almost the entire 12-16hr shift there are no offices (nor almost any tables or chairs) in Amazon Fresh buildings.  Kind of a funny aside...  people at Amazon (due to work schedule and stress I believe) all look older than they are.  There are plenty of red sunken eyes, heavy heads, premature wrinkles really just general body language that screams 'I'm tired'.    \r\n\r\nOne of Amazon's Leadership Principles is 'Frugality'.  Generally a good principal to live by, I believe.  It is a negative though as it pertains to associate incentives,  moral and recognition at Amazon Fresh.  No matter how hard folks work on completing some genuinely difficult projects or tasks there is a miniscule budget to run contests or recognize outstanding contribution.  You would hope that someone in Seattle would acknowledge that an occasional pizza party won't impact profitability terribly and can just be a genuinely thoughtful gesture that would be appreciated.  But alas that is not the case.\r\n\r\nI could go on about a number of other 'con's but in short...  Amazon treats its employees  (from associates to level 7+ managers) as commodities to be exploited.   Chances are excellent this work will cause you and your family significant stress due to extremely long hours and time away from home.   Even during your limited time away from work you will be so tired and fried that you will be a mere shell of your former self.  \r\n\r\nIf you are prepared to basically give up a personal life, family, vacation, working out ...really everything not Amazon related and pick up an oar on a 1st century ship crossing the ocean than Amazon is for you.  After all the money is good.  You might be that one in a hundred who has a fulfilling career in an FC but chances are excellent you will dislike the job and if you can afford to, you will leave as so many before you have.

The people at Amazon are amazing; the culture among the lower level staff is great. Almost everyone is incredibly friendly, very helpful, and very hardworking. There are a lot of people who are stars; they can do any task no matter how complex, and they are always willing to help you out or share their knowledge. \r\n\r\n2. Many of the people managers are also wonderful, they care deeply about their employees and their development, although they are limited by Amazon's organizational structure.", "cons": "1. Amazon's organizational structure is incredibly frustrating. The DA position was created with no upward mobility in mind and as such it is almost impossible (and always time consuming) to move up in the company. Amazon makes employees interview multiple times in order to move beyond a certain level instead of just taking into account the strengths and skills of worthy people and promoting them. There are also so few positions available to so many talented people that almost no one who deserves a higher position gets one.\r\n\r\n2. Amazon cares little for its Data Associates. DAs are grossly underpaid for the work that they do, especially when compared to other similar positions in any other company in the surrounding area. Amazon counts on their brand recognition to draw in workers instead of maintaining any kind of competitive compensation or benefits. The organization also promised very flexible hours when I first started but when I left they had done a complete 180 and cracked down on time sheets, instituting a very inflexible set hours structure. Employees were given no other benefits to compensate for the loss of flexibility.\r\n\r\n3. Others are treated visibly better. DAs working in the same building as SDEs (or even seeing communications from other sites) can see how vastly inferior they are treated. SDEs are often provided catered lunch at events, larger salaries, and are treated with much more respect. DAs are often offered the leftovers from SDE events but cannot expect the same level of catering at their own events. They are made to obsessively time track to account for every single second of their day, whereas the SDEs are free to do as they wish.\r\n\r\n4. The role of DA has changed dramatically overtime but no changes in pay, benefits, opportunity, or recognition have reflected this. The DA position was originally created to be a glorified button pusher, just entering in data with little critical thought. Now a high performing DA is expected to specialize in various complex work flows, organize small-to-mid level projects, communicate cross-site, be able to train others on various workflows, and develop new and up and coming projects. The wage has remained the same since the DA position was created though the position has become more of a workflow specialist or coordinator position. Upper level management seems to neither understand nor care for this, as the same compensation is still being offered, the job description remains the same, and DAs continue to be undervalued and underdeveloped."}, {"review_title": "Sort team/ one man team", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Joliet, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Loved the work model of having different jobs.

I worked in Retail Systems, and they are mostly bogged down in trouble tickets and constant feature requests from the business side, leaving little time to actually develop software.  Furthermore, the paranoia about losing money leads to aversion toward software change, which means the code-base is a monstrous pile of incremental changes accumulated over the years.  Almost no documentation, and I frequently would hear sentiments that documentation or comments would be a hindrance-- since that would mean having to maintain the documentation or comments in parallel with the code (this might have just been a cultural aspect of my team).  There seems to be a revolving door for young developers, as well as people jumping around from team to team, so teams' know-how deteriorates to the point where there are large portions of code that no one is familiar with.  And yet, you have to support that code when you are on-call.  If you aren't familiar with on-call, it means getting paged at any time of day when there are problems with the software.  You might be thrown into a scenario where you are responsible for Amazon ordering being down, and the problem lies in your team's software, but you aren't familiar with that part of the code.  You will probably just have to relay this to your team members-- which is fine-- but needless to say it is stressful.\r\n\r\nI was promised to eventually get the chance to do some real software development, but perhaps not for a year or more.  If you are in it for the long haul, maybe it could be okay.

Not a fudging - an outright lie. For example, let's say you are supposed to be paid $80k in salary, $20k in bonus, and are given $200k in stock options over 4 years. \r\n-- First, your bonus. You're going to get that over 1 year, paid 1/12 per month. This will become relevant in a minute.\r\n-- Second, your total comp. According to the above, you're now making $100k. Let's say the stock goes up by 20% - win, right? WRONG. Your bonus NEXT year will be reduced so that you're not making more than $100k. So if you get a bump (to $85k) and your next years stock is now worth $60k ($200k/4 + 20%), your next year's bonus will be lower (call it $10k). Congrats!\r\n-- Vesting - the schedule is obscene. 5% the first year, 15% the second year, 20% each half year after. This differs from most tech companies which vest 25%/year. \r\n-- Now let's loop all the way back to your getting fired - remember that (point two all the way at the top?) - Because you're SO likely to be shown the door (50% of all first year amazon employees are 'managed out'), you won't see 100% of your bonus AND you won't see more than 5% of your stock (if that).

Three days off per week for Shift Managers and Shift Assistants when it\u2019s not peek shipping season.", "cons": "Just as a disclaimer, situations may vary from site to site because of schedule, protocol, and software changes. If you are tempted to think I am just another disgruntle AMZL employee, think again since I am currently the highest ranked employee for my position, according to my Ops Manager, so the following information may sound harsh, but it is my honest assessment.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Schedule: At my station, the current work schedule for Shift Managers/Shift Assistants is 12:30PM \u2013 11:00PM for the RTS Shift (Days), and 12:00AM \u2013 10:30AM for Shift Assistants working the Sort Shift (Nights) with a half hour lunch. Level 4 Shift Managers are salaried employees. Level 3 Shift Assistants are hourly employees, which means that L3\u2019s will need to punch in and out on time clocks located at the station. If you are single, the schedule might not bother you as much. If you are married with kids, kiss your work-life balance good bye. Unless your spouse does not work, you more than likely will only see your spouse and children on your days off.\r\n\r\nThe standard workweek is broken up into what is known as the \u201cfront half\u201d and the \u201cback half\u201d of the week. Front half is Sunday-Wednesday; 10 hour shifts with occasional overtime for hourly employees, and no overtime pay for salaried employees. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Shipping Method: Amazon Logistics is basically a recent start-up company within Amazon. I have been with the company since my station opened almost two years ago. I have seen a LOT of changes. Amazon Logistics contracts independent courier companies to deliver Amazon packages near your delivery station. That means the delivery drivers are not Amazon employees, so you will be limited on how much control you have over their performance. \r\n\r\nThe drivers currently use an all-in-one GPS/package scanner called, \u201cThe Rabbit.\u201d When it was first released for use, it would not navigate drivers back to the station. There are occasional updates to the device. More often than not these updates will cause additional tech problems, including: loss of GPS, loss of package itinerary, loss of scanning ability, GPS navigation problems causing drivers to return to streets they have already delivered to, wasting time. All of these issues have caused additional updates to the Rabbit in order to fix the first update errors. All of this results in high driver turnover as these faulty tech issues burn out drivers quickly. \r\n\r\nAt the station, the current software for processing tracking numbers and process is known as \u201cCOMP.\u201d COMP has also had several updates. The software is clunky, full of glitches, and, overall, not a very solid software set for a company with the growing financial capabilities such as Amazon. Be prepared to use several different Excel spreadsheets and pivot tables to track package counts and categories. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Payroll System: The current payroll recording system for hourly employees is known as the \u201cHUB.\u201d I have had my schedule changed several times over the past two years. Several times my schedule was incorrect in the HUB causing \u201cdouble-schedule\u201d problems, adding incorrect \u201clate-points\u201d to my record, incorrect \u201ctime stamps\u201d for working past 12AM, and \u201cincorrect compensation\u201d because the HUB did not capture my work hours correctly. All of which will have to be corrected by submitting \u201cTrouble Tickets\u201d to HR and payroll depts. Watch your time carefully in the HUB because AMZL will screw it up! That is just \u201cThe Tip of the Iceberg\u201d\u2026But if you don\u2019t believe me, go ahead and try it. You will find out for yourself.

Three days off per week for Shift Managers and Shift Assistants when it\u2019s not peek shipping season.", "cons": "Just as a disclaimer, situations may vary from site to site because of schedule, protocol, and software changes. If you are tempted to think I am just another disgruntle AMZL employee, think again since I am currently the highest ranked employee for my position, according to my Ops Manager, so the following information may sound harsh, but it is my honest assessment.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Schedule: At my station, the current work schedule for Shift Managers/Shift Assistants is 12:30PM \u2013 11:00PM for the RTS Shift (Days), and 12:00AM \u2013 10:30AM for Shift Assistants working the Sort Shift (Nights) with a half hour lunch. Level 4 Shift Managers are salaried employees. Level 3 Shift Assistants are hourly employees, which means that L3\u2019s will need to punch in and out on time clocks located at the station. If you are single, the schedule might not bother you as much. If you are married with kids, kiss your work-life balance good bye. Unless your spouse does not work, you more than likely will only see your spouse and children on your days off.\r\n\r\nThe standard workweek is broken up into what is known as the \u201cfront half\u201d and the \u201cback half\u201d of the week. Front half is Sunday-Wednesday; 10 hour shifts with occasional overtime for hourly employees, and no overtime pay for salaried employees. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Shipping Method: Amazon Logistics is basically a recent start-up company within Amazon. I have been with the company since my station opened almost two years ago. I have seen a LOT of changes. Amazon Logistics contracts independent courier companies to deliver Amazon packages near your delivery station. That means the delivery drivers are not Amazon employees, so you will be limited on how much control you have over their performance. \r\n\r\nThe drivers currently use an all-in-one GPS/package scanner called, \u201cThe Rabbit.\u201d When it was first released for use, it would not navigate drivers back to the station. There are occasional updates to the device. More often than not these updates will cause additional tech problems, including: loss of GPS, loss of package itinerary, loss of scanning ability, GPS navigation problems causing drivers to return to streets they have already delivered to, wasting time. All of these issues have caused additional updates to the Rabbit in order to fix the first update errors. All of this results in high driver turnover as these faulty tech issues burn out drivers quickly. \r\n\r\nAt the station, the current software for processing tracking numbers and process is known as \u201cCOMP.\u201d COMP has also had several updates. The software is clunky, full of glitches, and, overall, not a very solid software set for a company with the growing financial capabilities such as Amazon. Be prepared to use several different Excel spreadsheets and pivot tables to track package counts and categories. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Payroll System: The current payroll recording system for hourly employees is known as the \u201cHUB.\u201d I have had my schedule changed several times over the past two years. Several times my schedule was incorrect in the HUB causing \u201cdouble-schedule\u201d problems, adding incorrect \u201clate-points\u201d to my record, incorrect \u201ctime stamps\u201d for working past 12AM, and \u201cincorrect compensation\u201d because the HUB did not capture my work hours correctly. All of which will have to be corrected by submitting \u201cTrouble Tickets\u201d to HR and payroll depts. Watch your time carefully in the HUB because AMZL will screw it up! That is just \u201cThe Tip of the Iceberg\u201d\u2026But if you don\u2019t believe me, go ahead and try it. You will find out for yourself.

Morale is exceptionally low, and people count down the days to fulfill their contract for their relocation package.  It is a sink or swim environment, and the senior managers (I refuse to use the term leaders) encourage that type of environment to see which employees can survive.  Amazon is a transactional company.  It provides it's employees monetary compensation and it expects a certain service level.  You will not read articles about Amazon's altruistic nature, you will not be encouraged to volunteer with the community, and even if you do have a 5 month old child you are expected to travel for the entire week without seeing them in order to meet with vendors.  The prestige of working for an online power-house such as Amazon is not worth the loss of a personal life.  Nights and weekends will be tarnished with the tinge of anxiety as emails, midnight deal flips, demand spikes, and pricing rules will forever require immediate attention.  Jeff Bezos may state that recent articles do not reflect the company he is a part of.....and clearly he has not had to stay up to turn on a deal of the day offer at midnight and work thru the pricing issues for an extra two to three hours with the expectation of being back in office in a few hours.

Pickers are under huge stress from the targets. One man was even running (literally running) to keep up with his picks. You are apparently monitored constantly so they know how many picks you are doing (even though I stayed in the toilets for over an hour and nothing was said to me from management or agency rep).  Other jobs in the warehouse seemed more relaxed but I suspect the lucky few who had these jobs were permanent staff. Fact is, if you are a Christmas temp, expect to be treated like a robot and have very high targets if you are a picker or packer. \n\n-Management will give you a pep talk at the beginning of the shift. I don't know if they still do this but the whole thing was pointless and just wasted time. The only time management seemed to communicate to us temporary staff was in this 10 minute talk and at 6am in a cold warehouse, I didn't want to stand there and hear them bang on about targets every shift. \n\n-If you clock in a minute late, 30 minutes or an hour pay will be deducted. It sounds like a trivial thing, just don't be late for work right? Wrong. When you have a lack of these clock in machines which there was at the time, you could be standing in queues for quite a while. The whole thing was ridiculous. \n\nThere are other issues with this place but I'm going to keep these short. \n\n-A lot of pickers didn't speak English. It wasn't a huge problem because well, if you are a picker, you won't get to speak to people much anyway. But if you need to communicate to other pickers for what ever reason, this can be a problem. \n\n-Smoking cage was too small. We were discouraged from going completely out of the building to smoke but I had enough of being crammed in like an animal so eventually I had taken to the street to smoke. \n\n- Airport security. I know how important security is for different reasons but the fact it takes at least 10 minutes off of your break just to get out of the warehouse is a joke. If you get an hour break, expect that to be 45 minutes by the time you get out of the there. \n\n-Agent reps are useless. I asked to be changed to the late or night shift because it was very hard for me to get to work doing the morning shift. I had to rely on my mum (yep that's right, my dear old mum) to get out of bed at 5am every day to give me a lift to work because I haven't got a car and buses wouldn't have it me there on time. I had initially asked for nights and then they forced me to do the 6am start shift. They said they will be sorting transportation but that had taken more than a month which by that time, I had enough of the whole company and agency. \n\n-In the 2012, they sacked a lot of people by text. Literally it was like 'we don't need you anymore'. Lovely ay? I was not one of those people, I had decided to leave about a week before this happened but my brother was also working there at the time and told me this was happening. \n\n-Also it's a legal requirement that water may be available for staff. Hmm the water was available but no paper cups. So no cups, no water. We constantly told team leaders and agency reps about this, asked them to put more paper cups there so we could have water but after 8 hours, nothing.

Also working here is slavery they give you outrages numbers of packages that they wanted scanned in and it has to be done by end of shift. For example 59 thousand packages. Some of [the jobs is very dangerous for example they have you split  For those who don't know what splitting is basically you stand at you assigned lane and you have to sort the packages from high side meaning packages from 52-98 goes on side and low side meaning packages from 1- 47 goes on side. Sounds easy. But its really not when its just one person splitting your constantly leaning over straining your back and leg bruises from leaning against the bar. You take a day off to see the medical doctor about the bruises and busted back. Bring in a doctors note and HR is going too tell you they cant accept the doctors note because i was supposed to report it to AM. AM is a EMT/PARAMEDIC workers.

Also for a 4-5 hr shift they only give you a 15  min break. Your break starts when they yell break. It usually takes 3-4 to get across the building to the break room. They want you to be back at your assigned lane by time the breaks up so technically you'll be lucky to get 7 mins to enjoy your break. When they have too much packages they try to play power hour and bribe you with gift cards. Whats a gift card to a person who never wins.

Amazon knows they have a nearly unlimited supply of applicants who need jobs. For tier one associates the basic requirement is a high school diploma, however, there are several employees in the Haslet, TX FC who don't even have a diploma. Management isn't in the business of developing talent. Nearly every management position is filled from outside applicants, regardless if they have qualified individuals already working at the FC. I recently finished my M.S. in Aerospace Engineering and needed a job while I search for my career job. So I started as a seasonal tier one associate during Amazon's peak season. I figured while I was with Amazon I would try an advance myself, if for nothing else than to gain experience with networking and managing associates. However because I was a tier one associate, Amazon wouldn't allow me the opportunity to interview for an Area Manager position (tier 4), even though I far exceed the qualifications necessary for an Area Manager. I believed I should have at the very least been given an opportunity to interview when all other applicants are recent college graduates with only  bachelors degrees with little to no life experience. In many cases these KIDS have never had a job making the Area Manager position their first job. I worked for a very reputable financial company as a Client Service Manager for just over two years as well as other various positions within the company the previous four for a total of six. I was told by all Senior Operation managers I would need to leave Amazon and reapply directly as an Area Manager. That puts me in a tough position considering I don't have two or three other jobs to fall back on. Then I recently had a SenOps person lie directly to my face and when that happened I lost all respect for Amazon and it's management structure. A large majority of the employees have a distaste for management and overall the atmosphere is extremely toxic, one without hope for advancement.

Good luck being a smoker since there is only one exit from a four story tall building.\r\n* No cell phones allowed in the building, no music allowed during your shift, it's basically like a high security high school.\r\n* Management walk around the building, point out flaws you have, and talk to each other. There is an over abundance of management and their job is to do nothing.\r\n* Mandatory overtime with little warning and low pay rate of time and a half ($15.00 an hour, which should be the standard pay rate)\r\n* Absolutely NO transferring positions for 90 days (three months) \r\n* Extremely strict work schedule with very little unpaid time off. Good luck enjoying the holidays and heaven forbid you get sick because they do not accept doctors notes.\r\n* DO NOT FORGET YOUR ID! Security will intentionally wait until your shift has started, even if you show up 45 minutes early to get a new ID made. They will ensure you are late to your shift.\r\n* If you do not clock in on time, it will be deducted from your unpaid time off, even if you are not at fault for a late punch.\r\n* HR is not there to help you, they are there to tell you the strict rules and then basically ignore your problem.\r\n* Your boss is practically a robot, and there is no \"manager\" to speak with.

Wait on hold for an hour to talk to some guy in India who regurgitates the strict policies to you. \r\n* The absolute worst part about this job is the fact they REFUSE to accommodate people who suffer from previous injuries. You either wait 90 days or jump through various hoops and fill out miles of paperwork just to be moved from a position.

Multiple current employees have applied for posted jobs that they are adequately qualified for, yet leadership at UTX3 tends to block those opportunities, by any means necessary. For example, an employee seeking a higher role within Amazon had no disciplinary issues or actions prior to applying for a potential advancement position. This employee had taken all appropriate steps to work shifts, complete tasks assigned, seek out new tasks, thereby asking to learn new assignments, processes and procedures, however, after mastering as much knowledge allowed by current leadership, suddenly disciplinary actions disguised as \"coaching\" are presented to said employee. An instance occurred regarding attendance that went a little something like this... supervisor approached said employee,  indicating there was an issue with some shifts missed. The employee knew that any shifts missed were handled according to the instruction provided by HR, and had proof of taking appropriate action to avoid any attendance problems. Upon presenting leadership with the documented action taken by the employee, the attendance issue was corrected and resolved, as excused and therefore no disciplinary action regarding attendance.  Second instance of UTX3 leadership blocking attempts to advance within Amazon was a petty \"coaching\" action regarding stowing an item on a large shelf (bigs) as opposed to an ambient shelf, 2 full weeks prior to receiving the disciplinary action disguised as \"coaching\", this action taken suddenly,  after knowledge of the employee applying for the advancement opportunity. Turns out that \"coaching\" is considered a disciplinary action that is attached to an employee file for 90 days, thereby negating any chance for seeking further job opportunities within the organization. To be clear, this employee has not experienced any disciplinary actions ever, prior to the aforementioned scenarios.  I am not the only employee that has experienced this leadership blocking mechanism and will not be the last.

If you join at an entry level position, you're in for a surprise.", "cons": "I  joined Amazon on May 2016 and work as Tech Support Associate (North America region) for Amazon. I work out of Amazon Development Center, Hyderabad, India. Our site looks after all Amazon International marketplaces like North America, UK, IN etc. for all roles like Customer Support, Seller Support, IT and Software development, Transaction Investigations, etc.\r\n\r\nI provide technical support for Amazon AppStore, Fire devices, Alexa devices, Amazon Music, Prime Videos, Games and Softwares sold on Amazon, Amazon Drive etc.  I work as a Tier-2 Support who are required to provide end to end support for Amazon products and services mentioned earlier. If any issues are not resolvable by existing troubleshooting, it is my responsibility to escalate it via a ticket on behalf of the customers and follow up with them till it gets resolved.\r\n\r\nFollowing are first hand experience I've as an associate working for Amazon :\r\n\r\n- Zero caring for employees who are working at entry level positions. \r\nEntry level positions are Level-2 and Level-3 employees. Level-2 employees are basically customer support associates (Phone, Email and Chat), Fulfillment Center associates and Level-3 employees are certain associates at Tech Support roles and other support functions like QA, WorkFlow etc. Each level has pay scales. Higher your level, higher the pay.\r\n\r\nIn US, the minimum wage is around $ 7.5 per hour. In India, we don't have such minimum mage per hour laws. This makes every company local or international take advantage of the people.\r\n\r\nAmazon pays around INR 400 to 450 per DAY to Indians. Which means $6.4 approx. PER DAY !!!!\r\nThis amount is calculated based on the CTC offered by Amazon. This CTC gets even lower sometimes. Amazon already gets to hire an Indian for 1/8th of the cost they incur on hiring an American. Still they look for cost cutting by changing existing Level-4 job roles into Level-3 and  Level-3 job roles into Level-2.\r\n\r\nThis way, they make the same work done by a cheaper person. This is how they get to be profitable after years and years of losses in business internationally. I'm referring to Amazon.com. Please don't mistake it with the profits which comes from other Amazon businesses like AWS.\r\n\r\nRemember, the change in Levels are done only with non-leadership positions. They won't ever do it to a person or team in the leadership position. They know that if they lower the money offered to persons in the leadership, the people will just quit. It is very difficult to hire a person in the leadership, so they will always keep them happy. Thus the happy reviews by others. I mean how many associates leave Glassdoor reviews anyways.\r\n\r\nWhen someone questions the reasoning behind downgrading levels, they just say 'business requirement' like it actually explains everything. \r\n\r\n- They treat you like you're nothing. Make sudden drastic changes to the policy, your team, team roles, responsibilities etc and say it is as per 'business requirement'. \r\n- Amazon expect you to be professional with their customers but when it comes to the leadership, zero professionalism. Bunch of pathetic people who join the company to fulfill their own agendas and use the associates for their own professional gain and growth within the company.\r\n\r\nPeople in Level-6 and higher positions are Operations Managers, Sr. Operations Managers, Program Managers, Site Leaders etc. They're people with MBA's from A-grade business schools in India. They have to prove their mettle to move up the chain of command. They do this by taking up projects. This projects could be anything. Usually they're  supposed to make a lot of meaningful difference in the working of Amazon. If it results in huge cost savings, they're usually accepted. The person who offered the idea and the project is then offered a overseas position at Seattle or someplace else in US. This is what everyone is after. Everyone in the senior leadership wants to go to US and settle there with their family. \r\n\r\nThey could throw a team of 1000 associates under the bus to achieve it.  When this associates demand answers, they get 'Business Requirement' as a response.\r\n\r\n- H.R is useless. They're just there to recruit people and they just listen to people from the Operations.

If any issues are not resolvable by existing troubleshooting, it is my responsibility to escalate it via a ticket on behalf of the customers and follow up with them till it gets resolved.\r\n\r\nFollowing are first hand experience I've as an associate working for Amazon :\r\n\r\n- Zero caring for employees who are working at entry level positions. \r\nEntry level positions are Level-2 and Level-3 employees. Level-2 employees are basically customer support associates (Phone, Email and Chat), Fulfillment Center associates and Level-3 employees are certain associates at Tech Support roles and other support functions like QA, WorkFlow etc. Each level has pay scales. Higher your level, higher the pay.\r\n\r\nIn US, the minimum wage is around $ 7.5 per hour. In India, we don't have such minimum mage per hour laws. This makes every company local or international take advantage of the people.\r\n\r\nAmazon pays around INR 400 to 450 per DAY to Indians. Which means $6.4 approx. PER DAY !!!!\r\nThis amount is calculated based on the CTC offered by Amazon. This CTC gets even lower sometimes. Amazon already gets to hire an Indian for 1/8th of the cost they incur on hiring an American. Still they look for cost cutting by changing existing Level-4 job roles into Level-3 and  Level-3 job roles into Level-2.\r\n\r\nThis way, they make the same work done by a cheaper person. This is how they get to be profitable after years and years of losses in business internationally. I'm referring to Amazon.com. Please don't mistake it with the profits which comes from other Amazon businesses like AWS.\r\n\r\nRemember, the change in Levels are done only with non-leadership positions. They won't ever do it to a person or team in the leadership position. They know that if they lower the money offered to persons in the leadership, the people will just quit. It is very difficult to hire a person in the leadership, so they will always keep them happy. Thus the happy reviews by others. I mean how many associates leave Glassdoor reviews anyways.\r\n\r\nWhen someone questions the reasoning behind downgrading levels, they just say 'business requirement' like it actually explains everything. \r\n\r\n- They treat you like you're nothing. Make sudden drastic changes to the policy, your team, team roles, responsibilities etc and say it is as per 'business requirement'. \r\n- Amazon expect you to be professional with their customers but when it comes to the leadership, zero professionalism. Bunch of pathetic people who join the company to fulfill their own agendas and use the associates for their own professional gain and growth within the company.\r\n\r\nPeople in Level-6 and higher positions are Operations Managers, Sr. Operations Managers, Program Managers, Site Leaders etc. They're people with MBA's from A-grade business schools in India. They have to prove their mettle to move up the chain of command. They do this by taking up projects. This projects could be anything. Usually they're  supposed to make a lot of meaningful difference in the working of Amazon. If it results in huge cost savings, they're usually accepted. The person who offered the idea and the project is then offered a overseas position at Seattle or someplace else in US. This is what everyone is after. Everyone in the senior leadership wants to go to US and settle there with their family. \r\n\r\nThey could throw a team of 1000 associates under the bus to achieve it.  When this associates demand answers, they get 'Business Requirement' as a response.\r\n\r\n- H.R is useless. They're just there to recruit people and they just listen to people from the Operations.  No point in reaching out to them."}, {"review_title": "Data Engineer", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Sept 2018", "job_title": "Data Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Only good thing is stocks which you get will be good.", "cons": "No new technology in data engineering field.All about their own tools which is of no use outside company.Very less design work just modify existing sql or write new sql queries.No ETL neither any good tools company has regarding hadoop everything will be taken care by SDE so no scope for de to learn.Lot of operations work."}, {"review_title": "Order Picker", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Sept 2018", "job_title": "Order Picker in Carteret, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome benefits.

The employ managers that are completely novice. All the are trained is to look at the system and see who is picking fast and who is not but what about the intellectual requirements. My skills, experience and performance put them on the edge as the were scared that i am more advanced than them and next i got sacked. And what was the reason; that i had time of task of one hour. Really. This is someone has performance rate of 8 percent every month, which is the highest allowed and picked 400 an hour as to targeted 300. \r\n\r\nPersonally, if you want to last there do not showcase your skills or try apply strategies that will help the company grow if not the will come after you in full force until the had you destroyed.\r\n\r\nI only feel for Bezos who does not know how is company is managed.\r\n\r\nCall me for more information on this issue.
