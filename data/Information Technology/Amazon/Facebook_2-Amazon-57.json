Also, individuals are not allowed to choose what they want to do anymore - it's up to system allocation, the case routing system will route cases to you and you have no choice. \r\n\r\nThat said, go the extra mile is everyone with ambition should do in any job, however in call center context the benefit of job-related extra mile is doubtable.\r\n\r\nThere are many so-called \"mini projects\" but more or less are helping people manager to alleviate their pressure. are these \"mini projects\" really help you become a better engineer/IT consultant in the future? I don't think so.\r\n\r\nThey are other real opportunities in AWS, however, if you were not a manager or team lead or very senior person previously, do not expect much from it. There is always more staff than opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn my current team, the churn rate was 25% for last year."}, {"review_title": "Extremely team dependent", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Dec 2019", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer-II in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Large customer base\r\n-Good *total* comp\r\n-Dog friendly office++\r\n-Good career opportunities if you are in the role you want to end up in (e.g. You are SDEI and you want to become Principal Engineer)\r\n-Even with my considerable cons, is a good place to work to get a good bird's eye view of many industries", "cons": "-Teams are required by upper management to place someone on the team on a PIP, even if everyone is a high performer.\r\n-Management has an open door policy in name only.
