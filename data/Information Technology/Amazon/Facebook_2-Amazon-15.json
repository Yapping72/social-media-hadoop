You also get an increase along with the entire company every year-end, depending on the company performance.\r\n- You get added to groups where you can ask for help if you're unsure\r\n- There are many opportunities available to you, but you can only apply after you pass probation which could take between 4-8 weeks.\r\n- There are many competitions throughout the year with prizes like electronic devices and shopping vouchers.\r\n- You get sent promotional items each Prime Day\r\n- If you want extra responsibility and experience, you can simply request it.\r\n- They offer you opportunities to study but only after 1 year and most courses deal with Tech Support and HR Management(for which they have very little space) and those are offered by colleges like Damelin and Boston City Campus\r\n- You can contribute up to 7.5% of your salary to your Provident Fund and Amazon will match it. You can contribute more than 7.5% if you like but Amazon will not contribute anything more than the 7.5%. Momentum is responsible for this and, as a result, you will have access to TaxTim as a Momentum Member which will allow you to do your taxes for free", "cons": "- Long and unreasonable shifts that you cannot change(unless you find someone to swap with). For Example, the shifts change every 6 months or so and they would send you a questionnaire to complete wherein you state your preferred shift DAYS(not hours). Most people would get their days but the hours would end up being something like 7pm-5am the next morning and the days would end up being something like Monday, Wednesday, Friday-Sunday.\r\n- Some Managers are just inexplicable spiteful and would do the least amount of work to help you out of a bad situation. I had great managers but i had one who would just disappear for days without saying anything or answering their phone and when it came time to apply for jobs internally, he was supposed to provide recommendations and when asked, he would ignore us which led some of us to go to previous managers whom we'd not spoken to in months.\r\n- The quiet people get taken advantage of, especially by fellow associates who get given small amounts of responsibility in their teams. I managed teams and allowed input and participation from everyone. I Allowed a free-flow of information and participation in our group to instill a sense of trust and comfortability amongst all team member, but again, this needs to occur from the top-down and in you have a bad manager, then that filters down to the group.\r\n- The positions available to staff internally is ofter temporary which means when your contract in that role is up, you come back to being an associate.\r\n- The company slowly reduced our capabilities from 2020-2022 and that led to more customer frustration\r\n- You employment status is based on your performance (specifically your RAP). If you don't meet your target for 4 consecutive weeks, the OPS team contacts your manager, you receive a warning, and they put you on a performance plan for the next 12 weeks. If you don't get above the 88% performance then they dismiss you.\r\n- Even if you've done all you can to help a customer, they can still review you negatively which will affect your overall performance and there is no way to mitigate against this, even though managers may lie and say that it does not matter. This performance also affects your future job applications as they can reject you based on your stats.\r\n- They require you to book leave a Month in advance and if you're sick for over 7 days, they often give you a warning.\r\n- All people that i know, who have left the company, have not received their full salary on payday and the company makes it incredible hard to get your payslips.\r\n- Managers make up rules as and when they please and the fearmongering is on an intense level.\r\n- The company is more interested in the customers than their employees.\r\n- I went in thinking that Amazon South Africa was different than the US and my experience would be different than the other employees in the US because of South African Labour Laws but they really do not care. They will work you to the bone and say that you signed a contract and that you agreed to terms which you never knew about.\r\n- You have to be outspoken and very energetic to get anywhere in the company which is unfortunate for those who are soft-spoken, but able to do the job.\r\n- The pay at the moment is about R70 per hour. Which isn't bad, but isn't good either considering the hours worked and stress you deal with daily.\r\n- You get verbally abused by customers and management does nothing. They recently started allowing us to block the accounts for a week but that isn't working as they come back to us more furious than before.\r\n- Customers are not the brightest and tend to take out their frustrations on you as a result of them not being able to make use of their mental capabilities.\r\n- The customers need to be dealt with within a certain time period which is around 10mins. If you do not speak to most of your customers for less than 10mins then you get flagged by OPS.\r\n- You get 15mins per day, and 20mins per week, for toilet breaks. But different managers have different times. The times i mentioned were what was on our Worldwide site.\r\n- Covid Leave used to be 14 days and now it is 10 days which they are considering lessening.\r\n- If you want to go for a vaccine, you get half a day off to do it (4 hours). If you do it in the beginning of your shift, you have to come back and complete your shift after 4 hours, regardless of whether you have any side effects.\r\n- If you dare take your manager to HR for not providing you the support you need, which they are required to provide to you, the manager becomes your worst enemy and General Management also backs them up to make your life hell.\r\n- They give you training on things you aren't sure on. For example, i worked with an elderly woman who was forced to do training on Kindle and Prime Video Support of which she knew and remembered nothing. She brought this up with her manager, and i also spoke up for her when i met with General Management and they both basically said that she needs to learn how to do the job or face getting a warning.

They offer a four day work week for those working in the warehouse. Inside, there's a cafeteria, a kitchen with free coffee. There is also a good benefits package (i.e. medical, health insurance, life insurance), Paid Time Off(PTO) vacation accrued over time, tuition assistance, and swags (gifts and all thing Amazon related for the Amazon loyalists).", "cons": "Amazon has some of the strictest work rules in corporate America right now. They expect their employees to give it their all ALL the time. The company expects its employees to work at lightning speed. They rate its employees with a performance system based on percentile ratings. Those who perform at of above the percentage rate could qualify for a promotion to the next level. Those who do not meet such expectations may be given the walking papers. (TRANSLATION: TERMINATION). However, they can re-apply after 90 days from the date of termination if they so choose, but then again, very unlikely.\r\n\r\n As stated above, Amazon expects its workers to work quickly. That's on one hand. But being this is a warehouse where there is no room for error, they take safety issues for employees extremely seriously on the other. SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE! Either they want their employees to work carefully to avoid potential workers compensation matters, or they must do away with some of the strict work rules in the company. While it's true that customer satisfaction must be met, it cannot come at the expense of risking injuries or worse. In order for Amazon to maintain its employees and to have some of its employees from leaving on its own, they must limit some of its work rules, the most important bis the performance ratings, where they are required to work at higher percentage rate.\r\n\r\n I am stating my case on my days employed at Amazon because there were some mixed vibes about this company. Some were true, and some were false, especially if there was a need to go to the relief station which can be done at the worksite I worked at as long as you returned to your assigned workplace immediately. For those who a considering to work for Amazon, lotsa luck and congratulations in advance on getting hired. Please be advised that working at Amazon can be Hell on Earth for some and may not be for everyone considering the long Ten(10)hours shifts and longer during peak season.

Prior to the pandemic, that would have been fine because light rail would have gotten me there on time. However, when they emailed me the night before my first day and changed my shift to start at 6am, I was essentially SOL. The pandemic reduced the public transportation schedule and there was literally zero chance of my being able to get there. Unless I wanted to ride to work every day at 3am through the pitch black bike trail that's lined with homeless encampments. That's not wise, especially if they see you regularly and learn your routine. And they would have because that's the ONLY route I could have taken to get to the warehouse. Amazon said they would keep me in mind if that shift opened up again. And it did, just not for me. My boyfriend saw that it was open via their hiring portal (he had applied too) shortly thereafter but when I logged in to apply for it seconds after he told me, it showed ME that NOTHING was open.

Someone else who was around my age got the gig. I almost went for the Learning Trainer spot but it was this one guy in Learning who received more complaints than the devil, kept on nit picking with me and all of this started when I called him out for calling me out of my name. Some people who are in some kind of management shouldn\u2019t be in the position cause some people let it get to their head once they get the vest. All of management talk down to you, I was physically assaulted by co worker and management nor hr did anything about it after I told them about it.

The entire organization just needs a reboot because there\u2019s a lot of things that gets swept under the rug. I hope something gets done like an episode of undercover boss gets filmed there eventually because everything you read about what goes on inside the building is completely true. One time during pride month a few years ago, I was wearing a rainbow bandana and a rainbow tank top and was called a homophobic slur by co workers and some of management.

They don\u2019t care how good, smart, or talented you are but rather how fast you are and how susceptible you are to taking nonsense from management. They encourage making mistakes at the expense of the customer if that means you reaching your targets. \nYou are given tasks to complete within unreasonable timeframes. If you make a single mistake you are called out and need to explain the 5 why\u2019s which leads to discomfort and inconvenience. Rather than helping you get better or listening to what employees have to say, they rather punish you. \nThere\u2019s a reason why staff milk their sick leave and use up every second of it, finding loopholes to avoid work because nobody wants to do that job. \nDuring training, they plant existing managers to monitor the employees activities, including how responsive they are to questions asked, if they ask questions, and how much involved they are in training sessions. They will then pass on this info to your manager who will then use this against you when it\u2019s right for them. \nThey will not tolerate any employee who questions their systems or methodologies. And if you do, you will be blacklisted and ultimately told to leave on your last day of probation. Why? So they can milk everything out of you to the point where you just want to leave even if it means there is no other job lined up. \nThey make you feel so welcome at the beginning and then they hit you with abnormal and unrealistic targets that THEY even can\u2019t do. Managers are there to police over you and not help you reach your targets. They question you, they point fingers all the time, and nobody likes to take responsibility for anything. \nStaff keep pushing work back because nobody wants to take responsibility as the penalties are so harsh. Nobody is friendly because the pressure and stress doesn\u2019t allow you to be nice. \nThey have these weekly team meetings where the managers read off a computer screen updates which THEY don\u2019t even understand, meanwhile staff sit there and suck up to each other counting the seconds to get out of this meeting. The whole environment is fake. The good and genuine people have all left.\nThey will fabricate data to prove you wrong. They will use data from your first month of employment (when you\u2019re still finding your feet) to justify termination after 6 months. And when you prove them wrong, they turn a blind eye. I know people who still work there who still complain about the unfair treatment of staff. They chat between themselves on WhatsApp because their amazon chime is monitored.

Most of the colleges you want to go to aren't covered & the only one worth squat going to, you have to resubmit your voucher every time you pass a course. They won't even trust you to just GO TO SCHOOL. They want to micromanage that too. And since this is a strictly online school, good luck getting an accommodation for your schedule.

YOU don't get a bonus. You get an extra quarter every 6 months, IF THAT, and then it caps out after 2-3 years depending on what site you work at. The only raises you will ever get happen once a year and they don't even have the courtesy to be consistent with that. Many sites have gone YEARS without a pay raise because Amazon refuses to acknowledge that the Cost of Living is steadily rising while their competitors raise wages & benefits.\r\n\r\n- Management consistently works to screw you, the L1 peon, over in any fathomable way they can. They hate you. They fear you. They do not care about you. They will use you. They will berate you. They will scorn you. They will destroy you. Any time you bring a concern to their table, they will cut you off and ignore you. You are nothing. \r\n\r\n- Speaking of benefits, their healthcare SUCKS.

Managers trying to trip subordinates if they feel them a thre!t, it\u2019s crazy!\r\nCollaboration is seen as being stupid because it opens room for others to steal your idea, so very few collaborate. Trust is a myth.\r\n\r\nCommand and control: \r\nThey don\u2019t like the word micro manage however; God forbid you have an idea that doesn\u2019t conform to how they can capitalise (as mentioned above) on the problem or solution. Suddenly LP (Leadership principles) are weaponised for self serving purposes and at times completely twisted from original meaning.\r\nAlmost Everyone peers/management operate in the Are right a lot LP space. Since they are right a lot why bother seek diverse perspectives? So the title and, 1st sentence of the LP is all that matters. If folks are right a lot there is no room to learn anything. So you will see folks are incorrect but won\u2019t listen so we move forward that way.\r\n\r\nAmerican based culture: \r\nOrdinarily this isn\u2019t a bad thing if they are inclusive of other cultures and understand that those who are not American need a moment to catch on. Then there is the Amazon peculiar culture which is a derivative of the American culture that isn\u2019t a problem if time is taken to understand those that are non American or have previous Amazon experience need a moment to understand what is going on.\r\nBad behaviour is justified as culture, rude tones, throwing people under the bus, excluding others, etc. honestly we should seek to grow and do better not stay where we are. What was okay 10 years ago isn\u2019t necessarily okay now! \r\n\r\nLong hours: \r\nIn the UK they get you to waive the 48 max hours a week clause in contract after 3 months you can get HR to amend and reinstate; however that will look as though you are lazy. Be prepared to work long hours all the time. ~60 a week and if including weekends possibly even more. Then you may be told you don\u2019t know how to time\r\nManage when you ask management to look into and it\u2019s an opportunity for them to micro manage. Yet the work load does not decrease. \r\n\r\nRace:\r\nIt\u2019s very black and white! So you are judged already based on the colour of your skin; certain bias is associated with who you are, what you can do, how smart or weak you are. It is truly appalling! \r\n\r\nMy ultimate aim is to leave as I am now sick mentally and physically due to this place.
