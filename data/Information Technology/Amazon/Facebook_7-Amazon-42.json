No matter how fast you work, they will never ever be satisfied. If you have some issues and your ratings drop, they will come to you asking why you are slow. Note, they are very very pushy and work here is very stressful physically. They care nothing about your health, they even want you to run and pick and pack, without a single minute to take a breath.\r\n\r\nYou go to the toilet, they come to ask why there's a gap. You have some issues with your work station and took some time to fix it and your ratings drop, they come to ask why you were slow. This is a place where they try all their best to extract every value from you, and try all the best to pay the least to you. Amazon is a bad employer and very mean and greedy, from the top CEO to the bottom PA and managers. If you have another choice, go.\r\n\r\nWhen you start to work, there's always a questionnaire on the screen, asking something like \"is the break room crowded\" or \"does the manager treat you like a number, rather than a person\"... You see these hilarious and pathetic questions? It's just because the managers care nothing about his workers and only treat them as some unknow number, that they try to ask like this. The break room is always crowded, always. People get sick and contracted Covid-19 in the break room when having lunch.\r\n\r\nWorst aspect is always from the managers and process assistant's side. They never knew how to motivate an associate worker. If you work really fast, then they are happy because bonus comes to them not you. If you work slow for some reason, they will jump and come instantly. Sometimes they even fire people right on the spot. Nobody is happy here except the managers and PAs. Don't forget, you cannot go to the washroom for some more minutes. They don't allow. They said you won't need that much time to p-o-o-p. Because they p-o-o-p fast, so you should also p-o-o-p fast.\r\n\r\nLastly, almost NO people work here for a long time. Most of them, nearly 90% are new hires who worked no more than 1 year.

In fact, they knew how hard I worked and made me do it all day, every day, and gave the people who were lazy better roles like Training Ambassador. It really felt like I was killing myself each day at work without recognition. The boss made some disrespectful comments to me and I even got hit in the head with a heavy box because he broke a safety rule while loading a truck. For what I was doing, the kind of work and the level of effort I was putting it, I should have been getting paid at least 18 an hour, if not 20. So, I decided that I needed a change from that department. That was just my experience there. Many agree that it's not the best working environment in that department and that many roles are unfair, but it is what it is and there's nothing you can do but speak up and do what you have to do for yourself.
