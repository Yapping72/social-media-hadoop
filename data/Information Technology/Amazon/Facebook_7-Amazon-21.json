Had they been honest from the start I don't think I would be as infuriated. \r\n\r\nNight shift associates get paid a nighttime differential because they work nights and get about 1.50 more an hour vs day shift associates.

I work from 6pm to 6am every Sun - Wed. \r\n\r\nThe recruiter also said that moving up and laterally is super easy in this company, which was true to a certain degree - until they changed the policy. You have to stay at least a year in a position before making an internal transfer and if you get a promotion in that time, you have to stay in that position another year before you can transfer.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, they didn't tell me what shift I would be on until 2 days before I started and I had to shift my sleep schedule literally 12 hours in two days.\r\n\r\nTheir 401k is also the worst thing I have ever seen in my life. They give you 50 cents for every dollar you put in - UP TO TWO PERCENT COMPANY CONTRIBUTION.
