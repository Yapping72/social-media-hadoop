The pay is decent, but should be making more, especially with the cost of living going up. Since the pandemic started they've only given a .50 cent starting raise increase. Sometimes people go to the restroom too much, so if someone who works hard and they actually have to go to the restroom once or twice in the day, they may get deemed as less worthy to move up in the company or as the other workers who don't work hard. The company is too lent on the lazy/poor workers and too harsh on their good workers.

I've been at Amazon for less than 6 months.\r\n\r\n* The Next Steps were always clearly described. From my first contact with a Recruiter to being made an offer, I always knew where I was in the process. Obviously there were times where I didn't know if I \"passed\" an interview or not, but I did know when I would be contacted (with a specified number of days).\r\n\r\n* Amazon went out of their way to make sure I and other candidates were well educated on the company, culture, and hiring process. From my first contact with a Recruiter, I was provided information on the LPs (you gotta know the LPs!), and other detailed information. I participated (with about 100+ other candidates) where I was given specific clarifications and instructions about the position and the specific LPs that interviewers were looking for. (They are practically giving you \"the answers\". \r\n\r\n* They set interviewees up for success. This was unlike anything I had experienced. Even during very technical, demanding interviews, I never felt like the interviewers were laying traps or coming up with \"gotchas\". If I made a statement or explanation about some topic, the interviewers would frequently dig for more details. (Hint: That's an LP!)\r\n\r\n* I felt the interviewers had a vested interest in asking difficult, but good questions during the interview process, and making sure I was a good fit.\r\n\r\n* I have seen many requests from potential candidates on \"getting the answers\" to the questions/scenarios. While I understand that mentality and did a serious amount of research on the type of questions asked, if you're just looking for the right answers, you're missing a HUGE part of the process. The technical ability is one thing, but the CULTURE is often overlooked. Do you really want to work at a company where you don't gel with the corporate culture? I sure didn't. I spoke with enough people and asked enough questions to get an excellent feel for the culture, and the type of people with whom I would be working.\r\n\r\n* It's not a mono-culture. Prior to interviewing, I was expecting a \"Yes Man\" type of culture. It's not like that at all. It's actually very refreshing to hear disagreements about process, functionality, etc., and it's all based on what's right for the product, team, and ultimately the customer. It's not a \"my turf\" type of thing which I found exasperating at other companies.\r\n\r\n* LPs. When I first heard about them, I'll admit I rolled my eyes and thought this was just another take on the infamous Corporate Mission Statement. I was very pleased that a bunch of these really resonated with my personal belief system. Another way to look at them is that even if you think the LPs are not effective, meaningful, or whatever, they provide a lens that allows you to know how people think about work, products, features, colleagues, customers, etc. (I personally like most of them.)", "cons": "I wish the hiring process would have been faster, but the sheer number of candidates that they have to interview is staggering. Amazon does a good job of weeding out people who do not have a good sense of analysis and non-technical people (at least for my role)."}], [{"review_title": "decent", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Warehouse Worker in Cambridge, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "somewhat decent pay and independent work", "cons": "can be a strain on body/hardwork"}, {"review_title": "Recommended", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good atmosphere for working and overall.", "cons": "Need to do physical work."}, {"review_title": "A Great Place to Test Yourself", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Solutions Architect in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* Everyone you work with will be incredible\n* Company pushes you to grow and innovate\n* Easy to align with company values\n* A lot of support to get you started in the right direction", "cons": "* There is a lot of knowledge floating in the ether that cannot be easily accessed\n* Opportunities for shadowing prior to being \"thrown in the deep end\" are hard to come by without extreme doggedness\n* AWS will take as much as you give it, so you have to be mindful of your own work-life balance"}, {"review_title": "Great growth opportunities", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Creative in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everything is process-based & tracked, unbiased", "cons": "Very busy, promo process can be daunting but at the end it\u2019s unbiased & fact based"}, {"review_title": "Great Place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Business Development Representative in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1) Great office\r\n2) High Pay\r\n3) Lot of learning\r\n4) Motivating team", "cons": "Too many tools and processes"}, {"review_title": "Great internship", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Vendor Manager Intern in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great experience & good pay.

Compensation is a joke as increases are usually less than inflation, even for the highest rated employees. Upon leaving I increased my salary by 75% for a similar role. Additionally, if you are given stock instead of a raise, this is counted twice, as years later when it vests the estimated sale value (pre 50% tax) is included as part of your compensation again and used as a reason not to increase your wage. I saw this happen many times with employees and myself. The promotion process is deeply flawed and heavily reliant on manager buy in (despite the claims it is objective), which is hard as managers change all the time. It is more a contest of which employees are more visible, with managers having to make a high pressure case or \"pitch\" to tenuously linked stakeholders with little context on the individual who can then essentially veto the promotion because \"I haven't really seen X personally\". Many people, myself included, were repeatedly asked to \"just do one more project\" etc to prove you are at the bar for promotion, with workload being always increased but the promotion never coming. Once a year has passed the slate is essentially wiped clean and you must reprove your worth to get the promotion. Overall the culture is very stressful and there is constant change of direction and management. This makes it hard to find support. Certain teams and individuals seem to be favoured and allowed to switch roles, define their own work, deliver what they like, get promotions, whilst others in the same org are sidelined and treated as lesser. I also found that there was a huge double standard in willingness to spend on employees who weren't of a super high level. This was even more obvious in covid, with no funds given to send employees even a bar of chocolate to say thank you when managers asked. It was not uncommon in my time for there to be essentially no budget for the team's Christmas party. In many teams managers would pay for treats themselves to stop employees feeling worthless. Very little money was given to support employees working from home. About 60 pound maximum towards a desk chair, if you stated you were experiencing back problems only. This is ironic for such a huge global company. Meanwhile dinners with more senior org members I attended cost thousands of pounds and unecessary and expensive plane travel was encouraged. \r\nMore recently, the return to office campaign \"working from here\" has been almost unbelievably tone deaf. It is not competitive as an employer in the current climate, will not age well, and minimises and dismisses employees genuine needs and concerns. There is no need to force people, many of home were hired during covid and have never been to the office, to come into the office 4 days per week.\r\nI suppose it is a well known name for the CV, and I met some wonderful people, but I would not recommend."}, {"review_title": "Refreshing and innovative", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Senior Account Representative in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Exciting forward thinking environment.\nFocus on innovation\nCustomer obsessed approach creates lasting relationships with end users", "cons": "Lots to learn early\nNeed to learn how to speak the Amazon Language\nEasy to get lost in the data"}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Warehouse Worker in Balzac, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "benefits when you reach blue badge, lots of extra shifts available, variety of jobs (alone or with groups).
