There is favoritism stemming from the fact that some people cannot do some of the more physical tasks and often are thus assigned to the \"less physical\" tasks.

(Lots of associates work 60-hours a week in order to make ends meet.) Also, pay is relational to years with the company (rather than skills learned - unless you move up to a higher level...which can be quite difficult to do if you don't want to move to another location), and the pay scale is not as large as it used to be. Also, Amazon pays 2% of your gross pay in 401k contributions, provided that you contribute 4% or more of your gross pay. These company contributions take (at least) 3 years to vest.

Same time, you will learn a great deal and will understands IT end-to-end.\r\n\r\nFor an SDE, being a part of Amazon Web Services gives you the edge to work on truly high-scale projects and buys you a free ticket to many other work places when you decide to leave. Interestingly enough, right now there is an exodus of Microsoft people willing to switch over and work for AWS.\r\n\r\nAmazon is definitely not for everyone and requires a lot of effort to stay sane. Yes, you will be stressed out almost every day: either being on-call fixing stuff you never seen before (the timer is ticking btw) or managing unrealistic project deadlines or very often both in parallel. However you may look at it from another angle -- this is how people bond and develop trust when they go through hell together. Your Amazon co-workers will be like your good old army friends forever.\r\n\r\nOn-call can be horrible depending on the team or time of the year but don't create illusions because the industry is shifting the majority of software jobs towards developing and running services. Amazon will take you ahead on that and you will learn how it's done on the large scale. As a matter of fact, at Microsoft more and more devs carrying a pager too and also staying sleepless (yeah a bit to the East, in Redmond.)\r\n\r\nI like the fact that people don't slack around here and majority of managers are occupied with a plenty of real issues and getting paged too. There is very little of bureaucracy here: know the right thing to do? then go and just do it! You will feel empowered when you realize that you control such a huge fleet. You will find a lot of smart people around you and most of the time they say what they mean.\r\n\r\nAfter tasting Amazon it is hard to go back to the traditional IT company where everything is slow and managers are afraid of changes.

It is a sink-or-swim environment. Taking this into account, I would say that entering Amazon is probably better as the second job when you already know quite a few things, learned to code well, understand how to manage priorities, and now it's time to turn your brain on full throttle.\r\n\r\nAmazon has the worst choice of medical plans across pretty much all high-tech non-startup companies in the area and I don't count MS at all here.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I do not recommend Amazon to my friends because it is not a comfortable place to work at.

The turnover rate is high because a lot of new hires see early on it isn\u2019t for them and that shouldn\u2019t reflect negatively on Amazon, if anything I find it great that they hire in bulk, they seem to give everyone a chance which I know a lot of us need. It boggles my mind over these negative reviews, your employer created the rules...follow them or quit? It\u2019s really that simple. Benefits rock, atmosphere is great, you do feel valued despite reading that we are just a \u201cbadge number,\u201d in reality the badge numbers are crucial because if your family calls in for an emergency they NEED to know where you are to connect you as soon as possible. They only require 24 hour notice for vacation, you can take pto if you feel like leaving, break rooms are fantastic and a wide variety of food/drinks/etc. I would definitely encourage everyone to apply, you won\u2019t know if you like it until you try.
