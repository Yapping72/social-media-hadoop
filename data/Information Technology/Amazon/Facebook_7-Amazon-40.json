I've seen driver carry bottles in cars, which frankly should not be the case for a wealthy giant like amazon.\r\n\r\n2. Sometimes you are assigned way too many parcels, that you know will never finish within the period. So my question is if this is a part time gig and not full time than Amazon ought to think about employee commitments outside of the time period. School Runs, after school classes, shopping whilst the shops remain open. It does not matter if the Amazon are willing to pay any extra time, people have set aide 3.5/4/4.5/5 hours for work, why are they expected to go beyond this and if they do spend extra time coming back to the depot with remaining parcels why is it so complicated to get paid for the extra time. The app should be simple in this regard. Not every worker works the same pace. I've seen some drivers just knock once and walk off and yes they finish their shift early, but at what cost? If Amazon expects driver (when doing a block) to wait for someone to answer and get all the people that need to sign to sign, and get all the ID to be properly carried out, than it should allocate mountains of deliveries to it's driver and go after the driver's that finish super early for maybe not doing their jobs properly (not the other way round)\r\n\r\n3. Parcels scams - Sometimes you have people that even though have the parcel, still report it missing. Amazon blames the driver by writing a scary email. \r\n\r\n4.

Wrong. The process on some teams is such that you could spend days just waiting for someone to review and approve your change control document, or working on revisions to the document because some wording isn't clear despite the deployment procedure itself being straight-forward and intuitive for anyone who's worked with CI/CD before.\r\n* All deployments come with risks, but the fact that we need change control at all means we are not deploying frequently enough to stamp out these risks, and there are many things which simply lack test coverage in our system due to aggressive deadlines and emphasis on delivering new features over improving operational pain\r\n* Managers and SDEs alike have a tendency to pile all the dirty work onto systems engineers and SysDEs, e.g. go figure out how much of these types of capacity we need in these regions and then increase the EC2 ASG capacity before we rollout our new service there (which often takes place through the AWS console because it's faster than writing a script to pull all the credentials for all the regions and run the increase-asg-capacity command), or go help out with these VIP-related SEV2s because you know how to click through that awful vip management website.

They focus on hiring \"full-stack\" engineers, but front-end ability does not seem to be a major factor. I've worked with multiple engineers who don't know the basics of responsive web design. Because of this projects tend to get watered down and are never as good as they could be.\r\n- No investment in Producers/Project Managers. There are a couple teams that are the exception, but for the most part designers are left to figure out their own workload management, intake processes, tracking mechanisms, prioritization mechanisms. This is not something a lot of designers know how to do or like to do. It seems to cause a lot of frustration as well as inefficiency. If you don't learn to say \"no\" it's easy to get spread too thin.\r\n- The UX Design role is not well-defined so designers end up doing pretty much everything that could remotely be considered \"UX Design\" including quality assurance testing, setting up and conducting usability tests, content strategy, writing copy, project management, unofficial people management (of more jr. designers)\r\n- Amazon has restrictions on what tools are officially approved for use.
