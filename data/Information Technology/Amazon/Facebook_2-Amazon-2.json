However this is much more easily said than done. I was placed on a random team after a generic new grad application and the first team was horrible, tough OnCall, 0 senior engineers, rotating door of leadership and managers. At this point I was really questioning if I wanted to fully leave or not so I decided to try out another team finding a project I was more passionate about. That worked and I was able to switch to an absolutely fantastic team for around a year and a half, light OnCall burden, focus on really mentoring engineers and helping them learn, and most importantly to me an awesome project. That being said it all came to an end because more often than not if Amazon is not seeing immediate $$$ from a project, even if the specific industry its targeting is known to take a long time to trust a new product, it will shut it down so unfortunately that is what happened to my team and sadly that seems quite common here. Then they will shuffle you with no say to other teams in the organization and hope that a square peg fits a round hole. Even though getting moved around sucked, I had a great time on that team so I have to give credit where credit is due. Being on that team for a year and a half I learned so much, created great lifelong connections and was able to be promoted. So even though in my experience and through friends experiences I see there are a disproportionate amount of bad teams like I mentioned earlier, there are some diamonds in the rough where you can grow and develop yourself with great people. - Pay is great - Benefits are pretty solid but nothing crazy - Promotion process can be annoying to deal with depending on your manager but for the most part its pretty structured. This changes depending on your level and title obviously but its better than just being promoted because you are friends with your manager. - Although I made the team switching seem negative (which when its forced or away team work it is!) Its also a positive to a certain degree. As a recent grad you may be unsure of what exactly you want to do in software, Amazon is so big and mobile that you can hop around to different teams to really find what you love to do. - Great selling point for future interviews and jobs, Amazon/AWS is a well known name and most companies will chomp at the bit for AWS engineers. - When you find the right team it is a fantastic learning experience, plenty of knowledge from these great engineers. Some advice is to stay away from teams with no senior engineers SDE III or higher, SDE IIIs are fantastic for learning from and have more weight when going to bat for the team against leadership.", "cons": "- Average co-worker will be on your team for less than a year, churn is high which is depressing but also work and knowledge gets lost. - In the 2.5 years that I worked at the company I had 6 different managers and was on 4 different teams and... - Only one team switch was by my own will. I knew I was preforming well because I was promoted fairly quickly and kept getting exceeds bar on reviews. It seems leadership only cares about meeting headcount sometimes and if one team is below on headcount they will ship you off on an 'away team' or just straight up move you, they don't care what projects you will actually care about. - The jump to get from SDE II to SDE III is seemingly impossible, many people treat SDE II as a terminal position which can get depressing. - Promoting externally is very big at Amazon, I have a friend who really should have been making more money and the comp review got him nowhere near that number, so he left. When he came back only a few months later they offered him way higher than what he was making. Its very likely that in 2 years (or less) new hires will be making more than you (depending on your level). - The golden handcuffs are real. Many people I talked with are so scared of leaving because they have X dollars on the table. That number will only ever get higher so if you have a better offer or are unhappy, leave. Sadly many people I know have denied great offers because \"If I stay around 1 year I get all this money\" and then when they get it Amazon puts more on the table for 3 years down the line. - Diversity in certain organization is pretty low - Don't play down the OnCall horror stories, they are real and they are terrible for your mental health. Towards the tail end of my time at Amazon I was on a team that was getting paged 30 times a week with an absolutely massive ticket queue. - Some teams do not have any senior developers. If you see a team full of SDE I's and you are an SDE I they will pitch it you as 'We're a young team and you'll get all these opportunities'. RUN THE OTHER WAY. This is absolutely not true and either leadership is not willing to promote people in a timely manner or they can't find any senior engineers to work on the project because its not a good project. Additionally you need mentorship as an SDE I and sometimes leadership will not listen to an SDE I when going over designs. - At the end of the day to Amazon you are a headcount, not an engineer with wants and desires"}, {"review_title": "Amazing place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Software Developer in Tempe, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good learning experience and salary benefits", "cons": "work life balance. you have to be self motivated."}, {"review_title": "Neutral experience", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Feb 2023", "job_title": "IT Support Technician in Dunstable, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Plenty of time to study other stuff.

At work more than I was at home with my kids. Because of the holidays getting a leave of absence is impossible. I got approved for a LOA 12/27 for the earliest date of 1/11/23. My employment was terminated on 1/6/23 due to excessive use of personal time. I was on flex schedule and I would pick up days and use my personal to hold me over for the week and a half until my leave started or I get money to get my car fixed. Which ever came first. I got approved for a loan the day I got fired. I was in communication with the employee resource center and the local HR team since the night I had to desert my car on the side of the highway. I was told I had options, but the local team was slow to respond and I was told via email there is no phone number; I had to just wait for someone to reach out to me. Next thing I know, I'm terminated. I appealed the decision stating I've done what I can on my end in hopes to reinstate my employment. I was denied. I have the opportunity to reapply in 90 days, but I can't work for a company that doesn't care about me. I was in the career choice program going to school for my bachelor's and now I can't continue my studies. I don't know anywhere that I can rent making $8/hr. I digress; per policy Amazon sees no error. My argument does not stand. All those surveys that asked if I was treated more as a number or a person I selected person because I mattered until I couldn't; but when they needed me I was there.
