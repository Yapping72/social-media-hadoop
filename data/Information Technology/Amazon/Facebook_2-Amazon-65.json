The average Area Manager's total compensation package is $100+k/year.

Yeah, that is why most managers never do that exact thing.  The company is growing so quickly, they recruit recent college graduates.  I have nothing against college graduates, an AM has to be one, but an experienced manager is now expected to guide 200 hourly associates and teach \"green\" managers how to manage.  Throw in high production standards and other high stress factors and your head will spin.  Amazon rarely gives yearly base pay raises which even begin to keep up with cost of living increases - they issue stock instead.  I was the top performing manager at our FC and received a 1% pay increase.  Interested in a promotion?  Get in line behind the \"Pathways\" managers.  These folks, regardless of performance, will be promoted or placed in the path of least resistance.  Some were very good, but many more could not handle the daily stress of the shift.  Out of the original 23 managers hired for the start-up, only 3 remain with the company as of this posting.

By cultural fit, you must be willing to back stab, be dishonest, work extraordinary hours and give up much of your personal life to this tribute to Jeff's sizable ego. Amazon used to be a great, cutting edge retail giant. Now, with one misstep after the next, the retail juggernaut is stumbling. Amazon is an incredibly siloed and disorganized company. It's not uncommon for three or for teams to be working on the same project and not know about the other teams until your work gets scrapped or even worse, you're told three quarters of the way that you need to now collaborate with other people. This is very common and a large reason amazon can't launch quality devices. Governance is unheard of at Amazon, and is a major contributor to the \"slap on some duct tape and move on\" mentality of the company. Amazon's internal systems are a joke...they are homegrown and piss-poor in quality. I was stunned when I started with amazon 4 years ago how behind the times Amazon is internally,\n\nIn the same vein, amazon's annual review process is practically archaic and a bit heavy-handed. They force every manager to stack rank their people and force them in to a bell curve. People are ranked equally on individual work and feedback from peers. This leads to people torpedoing each other through anonymous feedback in an effort to stay on top. If you happen to fall in to the bottom of the bell curve, you are managed out of the company. I have been forced to do this, because we have to hit a distribution across the bell curve. I fought it, because it was the right thing to do. Compensation is then determined by how a person ranks against everyone else. This is the same annual review process that Microsoft made national news last year for abandoning because it was archaic, reduced overall moral, and made talent development and retention difficult. No one wants to work with the sword of Damocles constantly hanging over them. \n\nCompensation is another reason amazon is a joke. Much of your comp is tied up in restricted stock units RSU's that vest over several years. I was awarded 100 shares last review cycle 2014. I am not able to realize this for two years, because it doesn't start vesting until 2016. My RSU award was based on stock prices at the time ($360), but since stock tanked with yet another quarter of abysmal financials my award is worth much less. In fact, with this latest nosedive, I lost 17k this year in comp. Jeff loves to talk about how he doesn't pay attention to stock prices; he is focused on the long-term vision. That song and dance routine only works for so long with investors and employees. I care about stock prices, 1/3 of my comp is tied to the mercurial rise and fall of amazon stock. \n\nOverall, amazon is a supremely disjointed, disorganized corporate version of the hunger games.

Once there, you'll have the chance to work with smart people and on interesting technical problems, and you'll have the latitude to solve them any way you like.", "cons": "Amazon recruiters may claim that their employees enjoy reasonable work/life balance, but don't believe a word of it!  Amazon is a high-pressure environment designed to pile impossible demands on employees and get them to complete with their coworkers in order to squeeze out as much productivity as possible.  You are just a disposable cog in the machine.  Once you're burnt out, you're easily replaceable, and will be replaced by constant stream of new hires.... The whole system is designed to work that way.  Expect to work 60-80 hours a week.  If you move across the country to work for Amazon, expect to be saddled with tens of thousands of dollars of debt in relocation repayment obligations, if you have any thoughts of quitting.  The one good piece of news is that if you hold your ground and insist on maintaining good work/life balance, nobody will tell you that you have to work certain hours - you will just be put on a performance improvement plan and fired for \"poor performance\" - and then you will probably be offered a severance agreement where you are released from your repayment obligations....  Expect to be put through hell in the meantime though.\r\n\r\nOh, and as far as learning anything from your smart coworkers goes, don't count on it.  Amazon has a deliberately culture Darwinian that encourages competition and discourages knowledge-sharing and collaboration....  Don't expect to receive any training to perform the functions of your job or any assistance from your coworkers, and expect most of your questions to be met with \"go read the Wiki\" - which by the way will probably be out of date, and was probably written by somebody who no longer works there - because Amazon has one of the highest employee turnover rates of any large, successful company.  The entire time I was there I spent half of every day fighting a broken build system that could go wrong in any one of 100 different ways, all of which were listed on a Wiki with arcane instructions for resolving them \u2013 and every once in a while, it would break in some other way that wasn't listed....  Nobody bothered to put in the effort to fix any of this, because everyone was more focused on completing their own projects than on common infrastructure \u2013 and as far as management was concerned, who cares if developers have to work long hours to deal with this?  They're smart - they can figure it out.\r\n\r\nYou might develop innovative solutions to difficult technical problems at Amazon, but you're equally likely to bang your head against the wall until you somehow manage to reinvent the wheel \u2013 perhaps in one of the least efficient ways possible, one which may be barely adequate....  Expect to have to reinvent the wheel over and over again, due to the lack of knowledge-sharing and brain drain from having so many people move on after barely working there for over a year.  With so many people so poorly trained for the duties of their job, competing with each other instead of working together, making the kinds of bad design decisions that come from working at a death-march pace, it's amazing that anything works at Amazon at all....  The only reason it may work at all is the constant stream of new college hires.  They do not offer nearly high enough pay to justify putting up with this (I was not making any more than at my previous position in a smaller, less expensive city).  I was sorely disappointed after moving to Seattle for this.  I not only learned twice as much, but also got twice as much done in half as much time at both my previous job and the next one after Amazon \u2013 all the while enjoying better work/life balance and a consistent 40-hour workweek.\r\n\r\nAmazon is destroying the culture and fabric of Seattle, a city I used to like.  Seattle used to be a laid back, counter-cultural city, with liberal attitudes but a cost of living much lower than San Francisco.  Amazon is creating a housing crunch that has caused rents to spike to the point where they are almost not even affordable to tech workers and its antisocial attitudes are seeping into the general culture of city now.

Some teams are working on game-changing technologies. Amazon is well-positioned to make an impact on the way retail operates and on the way everyday people live. The Principal Engineers are very smart and they give presentations on cutting-edge topics. The benefits are pretty good and the compensation is quite high even for engineers early in their career. Lots of people bring their dogs to work.", "cons": "#1 Issue - Code Quality: Amazon has a leadership principle: \"Insist on the Highest Standards.\" In theory, this means that the code quality should be high. In practice, managers have conflated unit test coverage with code quality. Is code coverage a good metric for code quality? Is it not possible to write incomprehensible spaghetti code with high coverage ratings? The manager still gets to submit a weekly report to the director with a nice, carefully-curated set of visual aids: pie charts and graphs, which business-types love. Meanwhile, the actual code has several problems:\r\n\r\na) Many, many branches, with null being used as a sentinel value between interacting micro-services;\r\nb) Hard-coded domain knowledge;\r\nc) Overuse of semi-dynamic features like Map<String, Object> to bypass the need to write unit tests;\r\nd) Overuse of Gang of Four design patterns, with no actual knowledge of the appropriate use of those patterns;\r\ne) Extreme verbosity, with simple tasks requiring thousands of lines of unreadable code;\r\n\r\n#2 - Deadlines: Out of all the Amazon leadership principles, only one actually matters: \"Deliver Results.\" Deadlines are short. Piling on more and more technical debt is encouraged.\r\n\r\nPromotions are given to the most \"productive\" engineers, and years later when the product they created can no longer withstand the demands of the market, they have long since left the team. You see this problem in the financial sector too. There is a strong incentive to hide latent problems deep in the software provided it gets it out the door faster, because the person who needs to maintain the software hasn't been hired yet, and by the time the latent problem becomes a real problem, the engineer has already been promoted and is long gone. A constant influx of fresh, low-level SDE-Is is required to maintain these old technologies that are drowning in technical debt.\r\n\r\nAttempting to sacrifice development velocity as a form of long-term investment in quality is punishable by placing you on a \"Performance Improvement Plan.\"\r\n\r\n#3 - Primitive Tools: The tools that engineers use at Amazon are very similar to the tools you might find if you were to time travel to the year 2002. Ironically, there are no tools to help improve developer productivity. The \"self help\" culture at Amazon encourages you to solve your own problems, by yourself, on your own machine, with no help from others and without helping others. The productivity-based promotion system discourages collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe leadership principle \"Are Right, A Lot\" is interpreted as meaning that only information which can be neatly fit into a graph is worth knowing. Thus, things that don't fit in a graph, such as intangible improvements to the development process, never receive a budget. There is no official support for your development environment, including the cloud machine you develop on and the software you use to write code.\r\n\r\nIf you have a problem, you fall behind and your \"productivity\" is reduced. Your manager will get very angry with you, and threaten to put you on PIP. If you ask for help, other engineers will slowly start to resent you. It creates a very \"wild west\" culture complete with the lack of amenities, the aura of distrust of others, the lone cowboy...\r\n\r\n#4 - Lack of Diversity: Walking through the production floor at any building in the Seattle campus one might be stricken with the question: \"Where are all the women?\" The women who might be willing to work the hours expected of them, under the toxic conditions one finds in the engineering teams, will likely instead be found working as lawyers for triple the pay. Diverse types of people are not found because diverse ideas are not found. Amazon is so confident in the power of it's leadership principles that any dissenting opinions or personality types are ruthlessly cut from the employment pool by \"bar raisers.\" The people who do end up working at Amazon are almost exclusively young men in their 20s, early in their careers, from parts of the world that have high male/female ratios.\r\n\r\n#5 - Poor Work/Life Balance: One consequence of poor code quality and short deadlines is that everything is breaking all the time. And in order to keep the lights on, teams have an On Call rotation. The On Call carries a pager and can be paged in the middle of the night when a metric is out of band. The On Call always looks frazzled at all hours of the day for the week or two that they carry the pager. New employees, who have never written a single service and who are hired to help maintain an old legacy system with poor code quality, can be expected to go On Call after 3 months. The will be paged repeatedly for problems caused by other people, including people who got promotions and long since left the team. In theory, On Call is designed to improve accountability and provide an incentive for engineers to write higher quality code. In practice, it socializes mistakes and therefore reduces code quality.\r\n\r\nThere are people who work on the AWS teams work all the time and sleep at the office for just a few hours at night."}, {"review_title": "Not the greatest place to be a Systems Engineer", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Systems Engineer in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some really smart people there that will push you to be better.", "cons": "In infrastructure there is no work/life balance.

This is as long as they don't screw anything up too bad.\r\n\r\n   The 401K plan is terrible. It matches 1/2% up to 4% (in other words you put up 4% and get only 2% match). You are only vested in the plan after 3 years which is longer than the average young professional stays at a single job. When the annual review comes around and compensation is increased, it is always at the cost of another pay. So if you get more base pay, you get less in bonus or stocks and vice versa. The only way to make more then what you are currently making is to get promoted. As somebody on this site already mentioned, the only way for this to happen is to work so much and long that senior management feels sorry for you.\r\n\r\n   The company also somehow manages to mess up the ramp up to the holiday season every year.

After you get through their intensive interview process, you will feel like it is a great place to be and that it is everything that you wanted in a job.  After they moved me and started at my sight, I realized I had made a mistake.  That was only within the first 3 weeks of being there.  Associates and mangers are treated as numbers.  Your input is not regarded in any decisions and you must accept whatever senior management wants.  If you are a leader that cares about the people that work for you, this is not the place to be.  Everyone is treated as if they are disposable.  During my time there, I saw approximately 30 managers leave from various levels.  That equated to an almost 30-40% loss in management.  With the losses, no one was replaced and the work volume was dumped on those that remained.  When new managers are brought on they send them to a one week training at another facility with 50 other managers to prepare for your new job.  The week there is great, but it truly does not prepare you for the madness that is to come.  Every week they have 50 new managers in that training.  What does that tell you that they can hire 50 new managers every week and continue to always have open positions?  They will say it is all the opening of new FC's and constant promotion to higher levels, but the reality is attrition.  I asked specifically during my interview and that is the response I got.

This is partially because of the stock vesting schedule (5/15/40/40).\r\n- RESUME BOOSTER - I am applying to other companies and my callback rate is > 75%\r\n- AWS AS YOUR PLAYGROUND - This can be a good learning experience. It definitely is awesome not being limited by cost and having internal tools that help you setup an AWS account for your new service relatively quickly.\r\n- DECENT LOCATION NEAR DOWNTOWN SEATTLE - I am as critical as Seattle as any transplant but 2 years later, it is home and I can appreciate being close to the shopping, food, and entertainment nearby.\r\n- OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY OUT DIFFERENT DOMESTIC/INTERNATIONAL OFFICES", "cons": "- WORK-LIFE BALANCE IS ABYSMAL - It is normal to see various SDM's/TPM's sending out emails on the weekends. During a month long stretch it was normal for another SDE and myself on the same project staying till 8PM at the earliest and staying online till midnight. And even if we were the only two in the office, or it was a normal work week with no deadlines coming up, it was normal to see other engineers/managers on Chime that late anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\n- PAINFUL TRANSFERRING PROCESS - Let's say enough is enough and you try to move to a different team. This new team will have access to your code reviews/commits which is a true gauge of your work, but some still decide that they need to give you formal interviews. In fact, some will have 22 year olds conducting these \"formal\" interviews that are not formal in the slightest. They will do things that would not fly in any external formal interview like not stating the question correctly... not booking a room for the interview... being 15 minutes late for the interview... asking where you're from which is a HUGE HR no-no. This is the interview experience you get when the only thing you need to be qualified for an interview is attending 2 interview sessions.\r\n\r\nAlso, despite the fact that you guys are technically coworkers and should stay professional, and despite the fact that sometimes you are down the hall from each other and see each other every day, you will be ghosted by certain hiring managers during the transfer process even if he/she showed signs of interest before, so you are left on your bad team trying to find a better team, with no professional guidance/correspondence from your prospective team and are forced to find a different team.\r\n\r\nI have also seen employees been put on  a PIP on one team, only to excel on their new team which goes to show that one size does not fit all. However, the new promotion process requires a sign-off to transfer, which you can see would lead to more politics on blocking the transfer, which is morbidly ironic if one of the reasons you're leaving in the first place is politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n- HIGH TURNOVER - Good luck figuring out that service with no documentation because it was written by someone who was in the same boat as you of trying to figure out a service that someone who left for greener pastures wrote a long time ago. You know turnover is bad when your team that had 5 devs and 2 PM's leave within 1.5 years was the team with the LEAST turnover in your time at Amazon.\r\n\r\n\r\n- TOO MANY NEW GRADS - You just got an offer from Amazon out of college right? You're on top of the world and feel like you're the smartest person in the room right? Of course you're going to take it, you're from flyover country and six figures is a lot of money, right? Well thousands of other new grads across the country thought the same thing and are going to start at the same time as you. \r\n\r\nAmazon is expanding rapidly and so Amazon needs hungry grads. As a new grad, it's luck of the draw for what team you end up on, so if you're lucky you'll get a manager that realizes there needs to be a healthy ratio of experienced SDE2/3's and SDE1's. But chances are you'll end up with a manager who just wants to throw headcount at everything to build an empire, or is just part of a bad team that no seasoned dev wants to join so they need any body they can get, and you end up on a team with one recently joined SDE2 and five SDE1's. This is not a great environment with which to start your career since you won't have ideal mentoring. \r\n\r\nMoreover, there is already a huge lack of professionalism in tech, but this exacerbated when the average age is so young and you have to remind your younger peers that the Chime team room is not a place for profanities or inappropriate jokes.\r\n\r\n\r\n- HIGHLY DIVERSE YET HIGHLY SEGREGATED - This is not specific to Amazon and is somewhat of a problem in tech in general, but Amazon is still guilty of this. Amazon employs thousands of employees from different countries. While diversity is a good thing and I have learned a lot about different countries from teammates, this still leads to a lot of segregation in that you'll see people walking only walking around SLU within their own ethnic group speaking in their native language. This is not a problem in and of itself, of course you want to socialize with people like yourself,  but it translates to politics in the workforce and it is not uncommon for you to see managers with only people from their ethnic group as reports. If you have any friends who are underrepresented minorities at Amazon, you will probably hear some stories, e.g. how a female friend is treated by certain ethnic groups with negative views of women, or another friend of an underrepresented ethnic group being mistaken for a janitor despite being a high-performing SDE, or just general backwards thinking that only caucasian people can be American and everyone else is from their country of ethnic origin. Note that not everybody contributes to this issue and I am for diversity, but from some bad apples it is significant enough of a problem to be worth mentioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n- POLITICS - I've seen managers with abysmal tech survey results, zero trust from their business customers or their engineers, managers who systematically prevent their SDE's from promoting so they can't leave (or put them on a Performance Improvement Plan if they try to anyway) and zero proof that they have any idea of what's going on... Get promoted within a year or two just because they were in that position long enough, or they kissed their manager's butt the right way, or even just get promoted so they can move to another org and stop being a toxic factor in the current org... Which is not how meritocracy should work.\r\n\r\n\r\n- INCONSISTENT PROMOTION BAR - Unfortunately the new promo doc was supposed to make things more decoupled from managers and give more power to the engineers to drive things. Unfortunately it is still very coupled to the manager/skip manager/org. I have seen SDE's get promoted a year out of college doing nothing but ops and bug fixes, with maybe a single project to pad the resume. I have seen industry hires with 10 years XP not being able to reach SDE2 despite leading brand new initiatives from scratch,  raising the bar, and occasionally working at an SDE3 level (only for some to leave to more prestigious companies like Google/Facebook). I have seen managers who have promoted engineers on work they have only done on their prior team; I have also seen managers who are not willing to acknowledge what the engineer did on their prior team, essentially making it all for naught and forcing the SDE to jump more hoops in their current team and give the engineer less time to get promoted before they get fired.\r\n\r\n\r\n- OVERALL TOXIC CULTURE I went from being a bright-eyed, youthful, optimistic college grad hungry to utilize his newfound skills and contribute to the world...  to a jaded 24 year old who is afraid to wake up every morning and go to work. I have attempted antidepressants as a formality, but the only antidepressant that works is taking time off work. It is not just myself that has changed but I have also seen friends go from happy young kids to shells of what they used to be. Joining Amazon with them has felt like the hunger games where even if you win, you're still part of a game that shouldn't be played in the first place and you've lost so much on the way there. So while a few of my friends have gotten promoted in under a year and a half, they had to work 80 hour weeks and deal with high ops and persona sacrifices to get there. \r\n\r\nI  have had managers chime me on my PTO days.\r\n\r\nI have had a manager tell me to be more like the guy that stays up till midnight every night.\r\n\r\nI have had a manager call me to chew me  out on whether I am really working from home (when I am literally on the VPN checking emails)\r\n\r\nI have had a manager call me when I'm at home extremely ill  on antibiotics, skeptically questioning why my antibiotics are taking so long to be effective (because I'm in control of how long they should take), and skeptically questioning if I am really that sick,  so I can come back to work and get stuff done.\r\n\r\nI have had managers assign deadlines to do a project in a month that would take 3 developers 3 months to complete, then refuse to acknowledge and push back the deadline when I state that I cannot finish the task by the deadline in 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nI have had managers attempt to put other engineers on a PIP not because they deserved it, but because they questioned the current manager, only for the engineer to leave and excel at their new role and be promoted.\r\n\r\nI have had a manager remind me that I only have a few years to get a promotion before Amazon fires me, while also giving me scraps that does not help me with my promotion document. Imagine being between a rock and a hard place where you need to get promoted or you're fired, but don't have the work/means to get promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I would stay away from Amazon unless you are 110% sure you are ending up on the very few teams where you can grow as an engineer with minimal politics."}, {"review_title": "CSA work from home", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Nov 2017", "job_title": "CSA Work From Home in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working from home.

Poor benefits compared to other top tier companies.\r\n4. Managers aren\u2019t in Amazon are not to be trusted \u2013 \r\nYour manager will tell you anything to make you join his team and make you work harder. But from my experience managers in Amazon aren\u2019t on your side. For example: During my 1.5 years in Amazon I had 5 managers (yes, 5!). The first manager was the one that recruited me. Back then Amazon gave me an SDE 2 offer although I was a senior in some other leading company. That manager together with his director, told me not to worry. They told me that Amazon give sde 2 to almost everyone, but then they promote senior people after 6-12 months. Shortly after I joined Amazon I discovered that there was no truth in these claims (even if you ranked high as I did there was absolutely no chance for that to happen). In fact, 3 months after I joined my first manager already left so that promise faded into the air.\r\n5. Unbelievable amount of politics -\r\nAs I described managers in Amazon aren\u2019t to be trusted. They are all about slaving their employees so they can move up the ladder faster. After a year in Amazon I came to my 5 (and last manager) and asked him about the promised promotion. My last manager told me that in Amazon, if you want to get promoted, you need to \u201cplay the politics\u201d. You need to find ~6 engineers to support you. Later on the same manager told me in one of our 1-1s that in order to get his support for my promotion, I need to kill one of my side project and give it to him so he can present it as his own initiative.\r\nThere is also a lot of politics on the peers level (which I won't describe here).\r\n6. Lack of diversity \u2013 yes, unfortunately that also exist in Amazon. My division had a clear preference for engineers that came from a certain country. All of the managers and senior engineers in our division came from that country. I personally didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence.\r\n7. Pay is only reasonable if you ignore the fact that you work 12+ hours a day.

The truth is that the only principle which works at Amazon is \"I'm the boss, that's why I'm right\", so be prepared that at the end of the year you'll go on PIP if you would dare to challenge any management decision, either if it is technical or not. Actually that is what happened to me, I've discovered that design of one of the company corner stone projects has flaws, so I've made small research and proposed better and more elegant solution, but since original project design was \"reviewed\" and \"approved\" by the management months ago my proposal was completely ignored despite the facts that current design won't support all of the use cases. Apparently management didn't want to follow it's own company principles, nobody wanted to go and say \"yes, there is a better way\", instead my direct manager placed me on PIP and his decision was supported by his manager too. If you are smart, you don't punish somebody who is pointing your technical mistakes or provides better solution, but it is not the case with management at Amazon and there is no solution to this autocracy, I've contacted org principals on this issue but they all were reluctant to say anything against approved design. And than I've realized, management doesn't care about the company and nobody would ever admit any mistakes, so I left.\r\n\r\n- poor/seniority promotion. \r\n\r\nYou could be the smartest person in the room, or a topmost performer in a team, but if there is somebody with the same level who joined the company before you he will be promoted first. Same applies to SD2->SD3 promotion across the teams in the same org. In general SD2->SD3 promotion is almost impossible at Amazon, after almost four years there I've never seeing anybody promoted to SD3, on the other hand company tend to hire SD3's from some no-name companies but with a right years of experience (for SD3 it is close or over 15).\r\n\r\nBTW, don't even ask about SD2->SDM1 move, although those are the same level (5) positions, company would rather hire somebody from outside.\r\n\r\n- poor benefits. Only 6 weeks paternity leave, poor 401K match.\r\n\r\n- no performance bonuses. Amazon annual base salary increase is within 2%, which doesn't even match inflation and if you think that if you were a top performer for a given year than you will be promoted to the next level, you won't, see promotion cons above.\r\n\r\n- poor bonuses program. No reasons to stay there for fifth year, you'll get less stocks compare to your first four years, stock price goes up and company thinks that after four years in service you should still get your level average salary.\r\n\r\n- annual review. You have to ask for a feedback from at least a five people you contacted during the year, be careful, if you wrote many core reviews for somebody and that person doesn't accept critics very well he could ruin your promotion. Same applies even more to your manager, there is under-qualified managers at Amazon. Company tend to hire from outside rather than promoting their own employees, which often leads to a situation where manager knows less about current state and yet insists on his own design view."}, {"review_title": "Staff accountant", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Dec 2016", "job_title": "Staff Accountant in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting and dynamic environment with a lot of driven smart people.

Micro management is the key word for Amazon.  If you like being controlled and watched, this is the job for you. The targets were raised every few months, making it practically impossible for one to get to a higher level. Once you had finally reached your goal, they were raised again. I was an honest employee, I speak four languages, however never felt appreciated. I was pushed to improve my metrics although I worked hard and the quality of my work was really good.  I often had terrible headaches after the shift and couldn't sleep well due to the pressure at work. Breaks are tracked to the minute, we were entitled to two 15 mins breaks and a 30 min break during the day, however were told to use our breaks whenever we needed to use the restroom, or get tea/coffee. Meaning that at the end there's not much of a break left. What made me finally decide to leave Amazon was the fact that the management reported my every little attempt to speak up and voice my criticism towards them. I was accused of being \"too emotional\" when expressing my opinion. After a few incidents of back and forth behavior-reporting, I knew I needed to leave this place as I was experiencing a minor depression. This decision was the best I could have done, I still cannot believe my luck with my new company and that I can go to the restroom whenever I want or just say hello to a coworker without having one of the managers ask why I am not at my desk."}], [{"review_title": "Good Pay, Toxic Culture", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Program Manager in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay is good, at a level where you can survive in Seattle", "cons": "Diversity is non-existent in non-tech sphere, highly bureaucratic and dictatorial, not actually data driven, promotions given on basis of favoritism rather than achievement, internal non-tech transfers are slim pickings and usually already full when they're posted"}, {"review_title": "Work Hard, Have Fun", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Technical Services Assistant in Cape Town", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Update with the latest services AWS has to offer.\r\n- A better understanding of the services so that we can better assist our customers.\r\n- People you work with are of the best people to work with.", "cons": "Stats driven, it will be a tough journey once you start, however, if you are willing to learn, grow and keep pushing forward then possibilities are endless."}, {"review_title": "Sort associate, avoid level 1 employment at Amazon", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Sortation Associate in Fort Worth, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting no day is the same even though you do the same thing every day", "cons": "Harsh conditions.

There are fifedoms that go unchallenged.\r\n\r\n- Poor people management & lack of quality leadership. It is not uncommon for employees with little aptitude or relevant experience to be promoted based on politics. They often make poor managers and contribute to negative employee morale. I've seen wonderful & talented employees ignored in favour of less competent counterparts, due to nonsensical personal politics wielded by snr management. Without exception, they all have walked away & into much better jobs. Amazon find it hard to keep talent, & when they get talent they dont seem to know how to leverage it. \r\n\r\n- The Amazon value of \"frugality\" is in theory a good one, however the way in which it's leveraged within  the organisation, leaves many employees feeling used and abused. The constant pinching over basic expenses, door desks, computer equipment etc results in employees feeling demotivated and uninvested in the company. \r\n\r\n- Type A micromanagement. Everything from MBA managers telling you how to write an email or telling you how to do the job you've been doing for the last 15 years - a job in they haven't done. There is a pervasive sense from snr management, that they are 'superior beings' and this grates,  particularly if you find them to be ineffective. There can be lots of focus on face time & clock watching. I was based in HQ (not in a distribution centre) but it felt like I was working a shift job where I had to punch in & punch out. If I was 15 mins late they would want me to stay 15 mins more at the end of the day. \r\n\r\n- Incredibly high employee churn. This is for a multitude of reasons: lack of work life balance; Type A culture of micromanagement; 'frugality' & poor people management in which unethical politics pervades. The company bleeds talent constantly, but there doesn't appear to be an interest in addressing the issue of churn - in my team, snr management stopped telling the team when a coworker had resigned, because to do so would possibly mean having to address the underlying & aforementioned issues of why employees leave."}, {"review_title": "There is no work/ life balance and they have unrealistic expectations", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Sept 2012", "job_title": "Vendor Manager in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Company is driven by metrics and making money but they will gobble employees up along the way.", "cons": "They will tell you that you are doing a great job and 6 months later push you out before you are vested in your stock......beware, they are all very inexperienced merchants and do not care about their employees."}, {"review_title": "SDE", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Oct 2012", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not much really.

Employees that bring up these issues in various letters, protests, and articles have been met with complete silence. Their approach is simply to ignore.\r\n\r\nManager-dependent career trajectory. There are some good managers, and some... not so great. Politics are huge, as in most large corporate tech companies. Stocks are on an awful vesting schedule, rewarding you for staying as long as possible instead of incentivizing you to stay of your own accord. People leave Amazon very quickly and within my team there's been at least three people who have left or switched teams within this year.\r\n\r\nPlease avoid working for Amazon if possible. It will wear down your soul."}, {"review_title": "Software Development Manager", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "12 Aug 2019", "job_title": "SDM in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Control your career, Opportunities to work talendated engineers,  Challenging work and very less bureaucracy,  Opprotunities to innvoate ,  Leaders are in generall are smart, think big and Fair to employees.", "cons": "I really don't see any Cons as such.  generally, Amazon is good employer"}, {"review_title": "Amazon's fast paced", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Quality Control in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I was able to be promoted from situation associate to quality control in a short time.
