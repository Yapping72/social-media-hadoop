Having to track every minute of my time at work in real time really ruined the experience for me. As someone with ADHD & anxiety who can't work while being watched, I could not focus on my tasks until I could log off the tracker. This led to me working at night sometimes. \r\n\r\n2. The culture is really toxic, especially with middle management throwing people in their teams under the bus and showing us they don't care about our wellbeing, only about the team's results and how that will make them look. I've had this happen with all 3 managers I had in as many teams, so it's not just some subjective/personal I have. What makes it worse is the gaslighting and their pretending nothing is wrong and expecting everyone to do the same. \r\n\r\n3. It would have been nice to get some kind of reimbursement for the utilities since we work from home. \r\n\r\n4. There is no structured/organized/professional internal training. Most of it are presentations read by a slow automated voice, and we can't even change the audio speed. Apart from the technical aspect, every person on the team knows something different, and it could be months before you finally find out something important that no one thought to tell you about. I don't think this is intentional, but I do believe they are unprepared and unprofessional in this aspect. \r\n\r\n5. The company boasts its diversity policies, but at an individual level, team mates will still make sexist and homophobic comments and jokes to which even managers laugh along. This is inappropriate and alienating, and it caused me to choose not to engage with the team more than the job requires. I am not sure any amount of training will do any good considering the combination of the company culture + the deep-rooted sexism and homophobia in Romanian tradition. \r\n\r\n6. This might be a pro for some, but it looks like recently they will hire anyone regardless of qualifications. Most of my team barely speaks decent English, when the required level for the job is advanced/near native. This wouldn't be such a problem if they weren't allowed to write training materials/be in charge of auditing /explaining important matters. It's a very frustrating experience, since not even asking them to switch to Romanian will help the issue, as they don't have sufficient knowledge to pass it to others. The company seems to be prioritizing quantity over quality and hiring unprepared people. When they cannot do their job properly, the rest of the team has to take over, yet we are the ones sanctioned if targets are not met."}, {"review_title": "its just about the data you have to review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 May 2021", "job_title": "Data Associate in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "its good if you are looking for a year to work", "cons": "its a bit hectic for the day"}, {"review_title": "No work life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 May 2021", "job_title": "Account Manager in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Only the Brand Name will matter when you look out for jobs.

You will be expected to have communication apps put on your phone and you will be contacted all the time no matter how much you plan otherwise(Vacation, Sick, bereavement, weekends, 24 hours). The company has 14 leadership principles that matter differently depending on what you are doing. Most of these are embodied in corporate roles but in operation only delivering results really matters. Fast pace growth is awesome for job security but leads to a culture of employees at all levels that change/move so frequently that team building is almost impossible. You will have to rebuild teams at best every quarter at worst every 2weeks. Rank stacking review model, so no matter how good or bad your location is someone is always on their way out and some one is always on there way up weather they earned it or not. Ambiguity is high and never ending which makes standards/best practices a suggestion more than a requirement. Movement of job title, category, and location can be changed regularly without warning. Due to the high movement and strong focus on delivering results you should not expect for any of the senior leadership to engage you in anything other than delivering results. There is no structure anywhere in the company for rotation of shifts. There is high likelihood the longer you work for the company the more you will work overnights and weekends with no choice. You will not get annual bonuses past sign on and some role launches you can only potentially get a nominal base pay increase and maybe restricted stock units with a great review. Total compensation has not maintained past sign on bonuses/stocks unless you promote for anyone I know. Most people only maintain and increase in pay slightly with promotions unless they promote very quickly. So everyone I know that has not promoted at least once before their sign on benefits wore off lost a significant amount of money in total compensation.

Which meant I was also working from home on my days off for about 6-7 years straight. I missed major Holidays, Birthdays, and major life events with family and friends because of the schedule you work for this company. I worked every Thanksgiving for the past 9.5 years I was with Amazon, missed Christmas and New Years for the past 8 years because of my schedule with the company. It was impossible to request time off to travel during these times because of \"schedule black out\" times or \"business need\" telling me I was too valuable on the work floor the day before/of/after. Promotions are abundant, but from what I observed in my later years promos mostly fell into a favoritism scale. No monthly bonuses, but there is annual reviews twice a year. These reviews are based on a multitude of gradings on you as a leader. These reviews decides if you're \"ready\" for a promotion, getting a raise, staying at same salary with the possibility of stock attainment, or receiving the dreaded Performance Improvement Plan (which basically means start looking for another job). Receiving stocks used to be great when I started with the company. My first set of stocks given time in the company was 300 share units, by my last year with the company the max given to salary managers was 2. Stocks have a vestment time as well from anywhere between 2-4 years. That means you don't actually get the stocks until you work for the company in good standing until those 2-4 years from grant date is up. So the last 2 shares granted to me had a vestment time of 2 years, 1 of those shares was sold to pay the taxes on the vestment, and the other share roughly came to a $500 bonus a year for the total vestment. Towards the end of my career with the company I saw too much movement of Sr Leadership, which meant my development started over with each new leader. This caused loss opportunities for promotions within the company, because new leaders didn't know their teams well enough during review times. I loved the teams I worked with, met some amazing people, and gained tremendous experience to further my professional career, but because of the type of Sr Leadership I was exposed to in my later years I decided to leave only 6 months shy of my 10 year anniversary with the company."}, {"review_title": "Hardwork With Little Satisfaction", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Fulfillment Associate in Kent, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to meet people of all walks of life, it has a very interesting and diverse work force which is great to get to know.

All you will ever be told is to go faster, even if you are above average, you should go faster. Probably one of my least favorite parts is that people are punished if there is no work to do. If there are to many people working for a day, and you need to stay to get paid, your productivity goes down, and it is your fault, and will get you into trouble with management as your numbers do not look good.

You show up to work, and until they yell \"clock out\", you have no idea if your on a +1 hour shift, or a -1 hour shift. You learn to guess based on when they call break. Totally unnecessary. Training is for your job specifically (sorter, puller, etc) but you learn little about the overall company and where your function exist in the system - therefor little visibility to the world of possible carrier wise. Pay is decent. Oh, and Holidays... forget about them. Christmas is just another work day. Probably the thing that will make me quit. They have no flexibility in their system enabling them to run light or split shifts. Its an all or nothing system. Also, many years ago I worked as a sorter at UPS during college. Were talking decades ago, and UPS at that time ran a cleaner operation. You can tell this is a fast growing organization with not enough experience running it. Little things like logistics for employees... facility doesn't have enough parking so parking is done off site. You have to arrive almost an hour before shift to get a spot. Then another half hour after to get a spot on the buss back to your car. A lot of growing pains. Same problem with enough trailers... stuff sits on the docs cluttering them up because they can't get trailers scheduled in. So you move things multiple times trying to find space to stage palettes. If you can put up with stuff like this... they will keep you busy... and paid decently"}, {"review_title": "Great Place to work with lots of learning", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 May 2021", "job_title": "Sales Specialist in Gurgaon, Haryana", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Culture \nEmployee friendly\nFlexible working hrs\nGood compensation", "cons": "Lack of visibility on the management level"}, {"review_title": "Best culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 May 2021", "job_title": "Solutions Architect in Riyadh", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Culture, career growth, team, benefits", "cons": "Builders organization and it is always day if you don\u2019t like this you will struggle"}, {"review_title": "Work Hard.
