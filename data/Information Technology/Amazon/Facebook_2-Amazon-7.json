They recently changed the role guidelines to say that you need advanced degree in computational linguistics which is ironic as the ideal person for this role needs extraordinary patience with applying command line tools and about the level of linguistic knowledge that comes from having a general interest in it. Another disadvantage is there are fewer than 5 Level 6 Lang Engs in Amazon and getting promoted to that level is near impossible. There are no Principal Lang Engs and the role guideline doesn\u2019t have a category for it.

I think the people that get pip'd are the ones who make posts majority of the time. Got tickets to go to local fair Playland by Amazon which was nice since I recently joined.
