You get up to two weeks , 1 week of vacation and 1 week of paid personal, and every quarter, you accrue 2 extra unpaid days. You can have up to 80 hours of unpaid time accrue before you max out, you lose all of your 1 week personal time if you don't use it by the end of the year, and my understanding is that vacation time can be accrued for an unlimited amount of time.

Insurance Benefits aren't too bad, if you're single, or have a spouse/domestic partner... If you have a family, still not the worst that I've seen, but fairly standard...(See Below)  For advancement and promotional capabilities, Amazon.com is also great if you're single and/or have a specific type of spouse/domestic partner...(See Below)  401 K is pretty standard for the industrial warehousing industry.  After being there for predetermined amounts of time (2 years, then 3 years), you receive a few units of stock at both intervals, which is nice...(see below) You MAY receive a small monthly bonus, based on the whole facility performance, so that's definitely good..(See Below)\r\nAmazon.com also has tons of Leave types available for emergency situations or personal issues, but really could benefit from enforcing the laws concerning certain types of leave...(See Below)\r\nThey also have an Ethics Line, for employees who feel like they're being slighted, or have seen something they feel or know is wrong. (See Below)\r\nTuition Reimbursement - WONDERFUL... Amazon has a pretty good tuition program. You have to be an Amazonian for over a year before it can be used, but they'll pay up to 12k for certain college courses, usually a technical certificate, or Certificate of some kind.  It's supposed to be up to 3K, spread out over a years time, but they're pretty flexible on that because of the limited number of available programs that you can finish over a few years time period... And they also pay for your text books related to the program/classes you're taking. Really, really nice.\r\nPay isn't bad, for a warehouse, unskilled, position either...starting out.(See Below)\r\nIn the end, Amazon.com isn't a bad place to work, it's really great for hardworking, high achieving, single people, or people who don't have families, or people with a college degree BEFORE you start at AMAZON.", "cons": "As for the insurance benefits, for a company the size of Amazon.com, and with as many subsidiaries that they own, they should have been able to hire someone who could have negotiated a much better deal for their group insurance rates for anyone with a family.  I've worked at smaller employers, with nowhere near the employee capital leverage that Amazon.com can command, and they provided much better insurance for families or Parents w/children, at much lower rates.\r\nagain, as long as you're single, or only have a spouse/domestic partner...and that spouse/domestic partner is able to/willing to move.  If you have children, or your spouse/partner can't/won't move for whatever reason, then you better have a college degree to move up within any real time frame.  In my 4 years of being at Amazon.com, I knew of many Tier 3's who had been at Amazon for 5 years, maxing out their pay, before they were promoted. For me, that's just too long to be in one place, with less than a dollar raise per year, to be on one position.....Unless you were some one if the opposite sex of who wanted you to fill a Tier 3 role (that's right, sexist behavior) or Unless you have a degree...Add that in and I've known of a dozen or more who were promoted within 18 months or so. That doesn't count the number of newly hired Area Managers that were only able to do the job because of the Tier 3's in the area, and then still fail and before being fired, start going on write up spree's to prove they can be better managers.  Amazon doesn't have a formal policy for having to have a college degree to be promoted, but even if you have more than a decade in direct management, don't think you'll be promoted to an actual AM position, at Tier 4 or above, unless you have a degree.\r\nThe shares of stock (Stock Bonus) that you receive, only twice, as a Tier 1 (or even after being promoted to Tier 3) employee is nice, but tons of employers offer far better bonus options, however, tons of employers also offer NO bonus options.\r\nAs for the monthly bonus that you MAY receive, it's far from guaranteed, and seems to be skewed to benefit employees who don't have children to take care of (single parents), or a handicapped/sick spouse, parent, or have to have another main priority other than Amazon.  If you use your Unpaid Personal Time, then the small monthly bonus that you MAY receive is docked by 50%. Use that time twice and you lose it.\r\nAs for Leave, different facilities may have different requirements for approving the leave, forget that some states and federal laws require that it is provided in certain instances.  Even if you have the correct documentation, then you can still be denied FMLA.  I know, it's a serious accusation, but it's completely true.  And their Ethics line complaints? well, maybe i depends on who deals with your complaints, but no one that I knew of ever was able to have anything happen (unless it was a Tier 1, who were sometimes fired as a result of theft)\r\nAs for the Tuition/education program, it's not bad, but changing it to allow for earning, at least, an Associate degree, since you can actually earn it from some programs, or with some college (from before Amazon), and it would really be great.\r\nthe Pay structure is somewhat odd, I've worked with temps, who have less experience, and knew than me, but made $2.00 per hr more than I did..Why? I had more responsibility expected of me but I actually made less than someone who was able to skate by doing as little as possible, making as much as possible.  Amazon makes an attempt to vary pay increases by looking at other employers in the area and calculating other benefits, giving an extra quarter (sometimes less, or more than that).\r\nAnd one more thing...if you think that once you're promoted to a higher position, (Tier3 or up,) you could ever skate by with only getting your regular 40 hours, forget it, as an AM or higher, you hae to put in a TON of extra hours, so kiss your kids, wife, and anyone else in your life goodbye."}, {"review_title": "Sr. Product Manager", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Aug 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Super Smart People (I did not say Kind) and .Challenging Work.

I was there almost 4 years and my team had a re-org at least 4 times.  I had four managers within the 3years I was with Amazon. I counted 18 people who were hired when I was hired and left within the first 2 years.\r\n\r\nI have read other reviews about Amazon and they are spot on.  I am one of the many that was places on a PIP because my manager had to pick someone. I was never informed that my performance was below par nor was I informed that my performance was being going to be evaluated against my peers.  The metrics used to evaluate my performance were never presented to me, nor was I aware of what elements of my daily work, project work, and goals counted towards my overall performance. Although I was apart of a team I was basically an individual contributor and supported my programs alone. No level of expectations were ever set, I had no clue what to expect from my end of the year review. I achieved all of the requirements of my PIP and survived another year.  Then after 6 months my new manager put me on a PIP again because they were concerned that I was not behaving like a level 5 employee.\r\n\r\nI left Amazon before I even found another job, it was that bad for me.  I rather deal with no benefits (which weren't that great any way) than deal with scrutiny I dealt with.  I worked hard to get to the salary I was receiving at Amazon but it just wasn't worth it. When I was struggling with my relationship with my manager I went to HR to seek advice.  The SR.

Both teams I've been on have had a one-week per every two or three months, but it still sucks during that week. Some on-call rotations are worse. Once you have 6 or 7 years under your belt and are about SDE III, you can get out of it if you set yourself up as more of an \"architect\" that works across many teams within an organization.\r\n\r\nThe work can consume you if you let it. I haven't had much of a problem with work-life balance (except around big deadlines and on-call), but I've worked with some people that regularly put in 10-12 hour days. I'm often the last one in and the first to leave, but I make sure to get my tasks done and nobody has said anything about it.\r\n\r\nBenefits aren't great. Their 401k match is only 50% up to a total of 2% of your compensation. So if you allocate 4% of your paycheck to the 401k, you'll max out their matching contribution. Medical, dental, and vision come out of your paycheck, but it seems cheaper than previous places I've worked.

The break rooms have water and coffee and include vending machines that you have to pay for.\r\n\r\nHigh-density seating is annoying, and people are complaining that they don't meet OSHA standards for the number of restrooms available for all the people they've crammed onto every floor. The new buildings going up in downtown (Denny Triangle) should alleviate some of this at least temporarily.\r\n\r\nThe shuttles could run a little more often, especially around quitting time. It's a 12-minute walk to the bus terminal by the convention center, but that shuttle only comes by every 30 minutes or so.

Pay people well enough to take money of the list of concerns and what motivates staff?\r\n \r\nAutonomy, mastery, and purpose.\r\n \r\nI worked at Amazon Web services for 2 years as a Solutions Architect and I can say hand on heart, it was the best job, working for the best company ever. Let me explain in a little more detail as to why this is fact ;)\r\n \r\nAutonomy:\r\nNo micro management from the team leaders, bosses, peers, but a wealth of support in all aspects from career aspirations to soft skills and everything in between.\r\n \r\nIt's day one right!? Sure was for me - Ideas welcomed and occasionally I thought of something that someone else had not thought off - this was a rare thing ;) None of that malaise that creeps in and stifles growth (Personal and company) to the point that you can\u2019t wait till the end of the month and dread getting up in the morning.\r\n \r\nYou are not spoon fed anything. Go out and seize the day to make you and Amazon better each time. YOU are responsible for carving out your own destiny. Yes, this puts more work on you, but is there really any other way?\r\n \r\nMastery:\r\nSuch a wealth of training, support, mentoring, career planning was offered to me it was a real inclusive feeling. \u201cWhat would you like to do long term?\u201d was a question asked of me by my SA manager at the time. We had a one hour conversation on what do I really want, how he would be able to support these objectives. If you have ever done the \u201cFive x Why\u2019s?\u201d, you will understand just how difficult a question this line of questioning is. Suffice to say, the manager really got me thinking and helped me plan out the next few years of my career \u2013 thanks PF. There was plenty of self-paced training available as well as instructor lead training to ensure that I was always at the top of my game. Great opportunities to apply this knowledge to customer questions and peers.   \r\n \r\nPurpose:\r\nThe most customer centric company on the planet is a high accolade to achieve and maintain. With the leadership principles (LP) in place you know what is expected from you before you even start from a cultural point of view. I knew what was expected from me and when I was failing, the support was there from my line manager (Who is one of the best people that has managed this employee) in buckets. Regularly taking time out to ensure that things were going well from both perspectives. My role was clear and a real sense of purpose to go out and achieve, but how I delivered was not prescriptive \u2013 See Autonomy.\r\n \r\n \r\nOverall:\r\nWorking and AWS is NOT easy.  With the wealth of information that you need to absorb to the number of customers clambering for guidance, you will always be busy (But this is a good thing). If you are looking to kick back and do enough to get by, don't apply to work here, you will not enjoy it. If you don\u2019t agree with the LP\u2019s, again, don\u2019t apply.  On the other hand, if you delight in being challenged, being given the opportunity to shine and delivering, look no further and get to Amazon jobs to find that role that you know you could smash.  \r\n \r\nI have read a few reviews about WLB (Work/Life balance) and I can honestly say that whilst there is pressure to work, work, work, you need to \"have the backbone and disagree (LP)\" when the balance in not quite right. I did just this very thing and support was given instantly to address this area. This is not a just local line manager taking pity, but a directive from the very top to ensure that we strike the right balance. We are all individuals and have different needs at different times.  It is not easy to get this right all the time, but when it was going in the wrong direction for me, a conversation was all it took to get the results I needed to support me and my family and the WLB was restored. No dramas, no fuss, happy employer and employee.\r\n \r\nThere are so many other elements to the role that are not understood from the outside looking in, so here are a few of the things that just add more value to me that make me a better person and therefore a better employee:\r\n \r\nEvents:\r\nSupporting events like Summits, Partner workshops, team meetings are great as you get to meet a lot of different people and improve your understanding of what AWS customers and peers are talking/thinking about. The ability to flex your technical and soft skills and know that you are giving your customers a great experience is so rewarding that you look forward to the next one as soon as it finishes, despite being exhausted. Thinking is hard ;)\r\n \r\nInterviews:\r\nYou are interviewing your peers. You have a big say in who will be joining your team. This was fantastic for me as we have all worked in places where new comers are simply thrust upon you to \"deal with\". Being an integral part of the hiring team was a great revelation both in terms of the empowerment, but the insights that interviewing gives you. Interviews becomes a cycle of improving your interviews, improving yourself to conduct better interviews, improving yourself to ensure that you live up to the standards you are expecting from candidates.\r\n \r\nTech:\r\nWow \u2013 I could write pages on this element, but suffice to say that the pace is relentless. There is no way that you could not fail to be impressed with the sheer pace of innovation. You are actively encouraged to add to this innovation and we are even given time to take a break from our busy schedules for the sole purpose of coming up with the next great innovation.

Pay people well enough to take money of the list of concerns and what motivates staff?\r\n \r\nAutonomy, mastery, and purpose.\r\n \r\nI worked at Amazon Web services for 2 years as a Solutions Architect and I can say hand on heart, it was the best job, working for the best company ever. Let me explain in a little more detail as to why this is fact ;)\r\n \r\nAutonomy:\r\nNo micro management from the team leaders, bosses, peers, but a wealth of support in all aspects from career aspirations to soft skills and everything in between.\r\n \r\nIt's day one right!? Sure was for me - Ideas welcomed and occasionally I thought of something that someone else had not thought off - this was a rare thing ;) None of that malaise that creeps in and stifles growth (Personal and company) to the point that you can\u2019t wait till the end of the month and dread getting up in the morning.\r\n \r\nYou are not spoon fed anything. Go out and seize the day to make you and Amazon better each time. YOU are responsible for carving out your own destiny. Yes, this puts more work on you, but is there really any other way?\r\n \r\nMastery:\r\nSuch a wealth of training, support, mentoring, career planning was offered to me it was a real inclusive feeling. \u201cWhat would you like to do long term?\u201d was a question asked of me by my SA manager at the time. We had a one hour conversation on what do I really want, how he would be able to support these objectives. If you have ever done the \u201cFive x Why\u2019s?\u201d, you will understand just how difficult a question this line of questioning is. Suffice to say, the manager really got me thinking and helped me plan out the next few years of my career \u2013 thanks PF. There was plenty of self-paced training available as well as instructor lead training to ensure that I was always at the top of my game. Great opportunities to apply this knowledge to customer questions and peers.   \r\n \r\nPurpose:\r\nThe most customer centric company on the planet is a high accolade to achieve and maintain. With the leadership principles (LP) in place you know what is expected from you before you even start from a cultural point of view. I knew what was expected from me and when I was failing, the support was there from my line manager (Who is one of the best people that has managed this employee) in buckets. Regularly taking time out to ensure that things were going well from both perspectives. My role was clear and a real sense of purpose to go out and achieve, but how I delivered was not prescriptive \u2013 See Autonomy.\r\n \r\n \r\nOverall:\r\nWorking and AWS is NOT easy.  With the wealth of information that you need to absorb to the number of customers clambering for guidance, you will always be busy (But this is a good thing). If you are looking to kick back and do enough to get by, don't apply to work here, you will not enjoy it. If you don\u2019t agree with the LP\u2019s, again, don\u2019t apply.  On the other hand, if you delight in being challenged, being given the opportunity to shine and delivering, look no further and get to Amazon jobs to find that role that you know you could smash.  \r\n \r\nI have read a few reviews about WLB (Work/Life balance) and I can honestly say that whilst there is pressure to work, work, work, you need to \"have the backbone and disagree (LP)\" when the balance in not quite right. I did just this very thing and support was given instantly to address this area. This is not a just local line manager taking pity, but a directive from the very top to ensure that we strike the right balance. We are all individuals and have different needs at different times.  It is not easy to get this right all the time, but when it was going in the wrong direction for me, a conversation was all it took to get the results I needed to support me and my family and the WLB was restored. No dramas, no fuss, happy employer and employee.\r\n \r\nThere are so many other elements to the role that are not understood from the outside looking in, so here are a few of the things that just add more value to me that make me a better person and therefore a better employee:\r\n \r\nEvents:\r\nSupporting events like Summits, Partner workshops, team meetings are great as you get to meet a lot of different people and improve your understanding of what AWS customers and peers are talking/thinking about. The ability to flex your technical and soft skills and know that you are giving your customers a great experience is so rewarding that you look forward to the next one as soon as it finishes, despite being exhausted. Thinking is hard ;)\r\n \r\nInterviews:\r\nYou are interviewing your peers. You have a big say in who will be joining your team. This was fantastic for me as we have all worked in places where new comers are simply thrust upon you to \"deal with\". Being an integral part of the hiring team was a great revelation both in terms of the empowerment, but the insights that interviewing gives you. Interviews becomes a cycle of improving your interviews, improving yourself to conduct better interviews, improving yourself to ensure that you live up to the standards you are expecting from candidates.\r\n \r\nTech:\r\nWow \u2013 I could write pages on this element, but suffice to say that the pace is relentless. There is no way that you could not fail to be impressed with the sheer pace of innovation. You are actively encouraged to add to this innovation and we are even given time to take a break from our busy schedules for the sole purpose of coming up with the next great innovation. The hard part is keeping up and for a geek like me\u2026 Challenge accepted!", "cons": "I have had to really thing about this element as I enjoyed this role so much I don\u2019t have anything negative to say. The only area I though was top heavy was the administration side of being an SA.

You are encouraged to leverage your areas of strength to contribute, and you really have the opportunity to manage your career, but you are responsible for managing your career... nobody is going to do that for you.  Everyone I've engaged with has been great in helping me to ramp, but I'm responsible for doing my homework ahead of time and engaging people to answer questions.  This isn't a company where someone is going to walk up to you and say, how can I help you, but if you initiate, they will be responsive.  My caveat to that is that your manager does have a responsibility to help you to ramp, and I've experienced that to varying degrees in the roles I've taken.  Some managers are much better at the \"develop the best\" portion of that leadership principle than others.  No matter the level, I've found that you are made to feel like you make a difference... because you do.  It doesn't feel like you're part of a big machine even though you're one of many, many employees.   Often I've been in meetings where the conversation can get heated, very strong points of view are shared, and it's very contained to that meeting or that conversation.  People value differing points of view as long as they're substantive or backed by some rationale, in other words, don't talk just to talk... it won' t win you any points.  The caliber of individuals I've had the opportunity to work with is mind-blowing.  You really do feel like you're working with the best of the best.  I love that the Leadership Principles are things we live and breathe every day at every level and not just some abstract or meaningless charters.  These are principles we are expected to use to measure ourselves and the way we look at the performance of others.  I also believe in the senior leadership of the organization, Jeff and his S-Team.", "cons": "Some managers aren't great at developing people, and it is harmful to the individual especially when they're new.  The depth and consistency with which performance feedback is delivered varies dramatically from team to team, and that's something that needs to be worked on.\r\n\r\nIt varies from team to team, but we talk a lot at the company about work-life harmony, but sometimes I feel like leadership and managers are talking out of both sides of their mouth.  It is expected that you ruthlessly prioritize so this company doesn't eat you alive, and that's with any company that is operating at the scale of Amazon.  There is always more work to do and it's the responsibility of the employee to prioritize and to align on that prioritization with their management.  It's also understandable that there are ebbs and flows, some times you're working all night when it's really busy but that is supposed to be offset with times which are lighter.  I think leadership doesn't do a great job of listening sometimes when an employee says, \"stop,\" it's too much.  I've seen it happen where there's always one more and one more and one more thing to do, and management has said \"well it all needs to get done but it will get lighter when...\", and that \"when\" doesn't come.  People, particularly people that are new or more junior, I've seen get worried that a \"no\" will be viewed as \"I will hurt my chances of promotion\" or \"I will create a negative perception or hurt a relationship with my partners/customers.\"\r\n\r\nAmazon is not a company where the word \"promotion\" is well-received from my experience.  Advancement can mean increase in scope or a new opportunity, but the \"path to promotion\" is too abstract in many areas.  We have leveling guidelines to help you measure your performance and what the expectations are at the other levels but I've found that many mangers aren't great about aligning your strengths and areas of opportunity to those in a way that indicates when, if, or how you may be ready for promotion.  It is a flat organization, and everyone I know has leveled down in terms of title to come work here, and that's okay, but promotion should not be made to feel like it's a taboo or bad word.  You don't get promoted into a role here (i.e. if you're a manager, you don't go from Manager to Sr. Manager just by applying to a Sr. Manager role), you do well at your level and either 1.  Get promoted in your role and then are expected to rotate into a role at that new level 2. have a current role that can be scoped at a higher level and then they level you up in your role and you can stay in that role 3.  Apply to a higher level scoped role (1 level higher max) and are expected to perform at that higher level for x months and then get promoted.  The con of that is that it varies from organization to organization within the company and sometimes from team to team on how that works and the transparency around that is not great at all. Sometimes people say you can't get a promotion unless there is a role of that same level open in that organization or the team, in other teams that's not the case.  It's super confusing.  The upside is that once you are up for promotion, the process is really good from  my POV because it's not based on one person's experience.  At a high level the concept is that a document is put together where your manager puts you up for promotion and you also have feedback from your partners supporting that promotion."}, {"review_title": "Fantastic learning experiencee", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Feb 2019", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have just finished a year of working at Amazon, and been loving it.

It feels like a grave punishment to your career when you are trying to shine under terrible leaders or a boss that overcompensates.\n\nFor Amazon to be one of the most diverse companies I have ever seen, they deal with the most discrimination and prejudice that I have never seen in my life. This goes for any protected class such as the LGBTQ+ community, disabled persons, people who practice a religion other than Christianity, etc. It is rampant within their fulfillment and logistics areas but Corporate seems to have a different experience.\n\nJoining Amazon\u2019s largest population, their \u201cwarehousing\u201d industry will be NOTHING like what you see in Seattle or any of their regional headquarters. \n\nYou have a 90% chance of never meeting your most senior leaders that report to our Lord and savior, Jeff Bezos. Do not expect to meet him either. Amazon is way too massive for you to make connections outside of 3 levels above you. \n\nChanges are happening daily. Literally. This is not a joke. We all get daily or weekly emails about what is changing and sometimes it can be an entire process to where you\u2019re unlearning something you just learned. Amazon will never stick with anything for an ample period of time. Your accomplishments fade just as fast because of this. \n\nAmazon has an emotionally abusive culture that screams \u201cyou are worthless and your accomplishments are a day old so get over it\u201d. You can literally give your heart and soul to Amazon and it will never be good enough. Your stakeholders will let you know that.\n\nThe Associates you encounter on a day to day are extremely needy and refuse to use the resources given to them many times to answer their questions. You find yourself in a never ending time loop repeating information. The job can also be highly tactical; even as a HR Business Partner, such as tending to menial timecard questions or physically signing someone up for text message notifications with their phone because they don\u2019t know how. It is also very common to deal with irate, irrational, and downright disrespectful Associates but Amazon\u2019s culture is for HR to endlessly take the abuse in the name of customer obsession. It mentally starts to drive you crazy because there is at least one Associate every day that tries to push you over the edge. HR doesn\u2019t get paid enough at Amazon for this and HR for HR is a complete joke when you need resources (like reporting a boss who is unethical). HR employees at Amazon deserve better and should have mental health days to escape the anguish the role causes us.\n\nFix the biases in promoting people. I don\u2019t know how Amazon hasn\u2019t faced several lawsuits because of this. Leaders will go through what\u2019s called Operations Leadership Review and choose people based on likability and other unlawful things and skip over people who need extra coaching or are more talented."}, {"review_title": "Amazon Web Services - Making the Leap", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Head, Worldwide Business Development in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is fast moving, forward leaning division of Amazon.

A stop can be anywhere from 1 to 5 different houses. Packages can weigh up to 50 pounds and majority of the time packages are not labeled heavy so there goes your back when your day starts. Packages a majority of the time come to us drivers already damages. You have no time for a lunch break (but you have to write down that you took one) and if your lucky you might get 1 of your 15 minute breaks. You have to choose whether or not you want to stay hydrated and choose between going and finding the closest bathroom and being called by dispatch to see why you are leaving your area or do what the guys do and pee in a bottle in the van. When an area is not accessible due to remodeling or anything and you let Amazon know and they forget they blame you for their mistakes instead of owning up to it. You get in trouble if the business is closed when you get there, or if the customer needs to sign for the packages but they arent home. You get in trouble for every package you have to bring back even if it's not your fault. Amazon asks you to give your feed back on everything to how they handle things, the routes, and the navigation system. Beware of giving feed back, they don't fix anything, they take routes anyway, maKe the navigation worse, and will some how find something to blame you for to give you a tier 1 infraction which will cost you your job. So next time you want to blame the driver for an issue with your package not being on time or damages.

A simple no brainer handoff is sufficient rather than working on the issue itself.\r\n\r\nRecruitment process / Job Interview : A typical telephone screening involved in asking questions about all possible things that are not at all related to the job itself. One same question is \u2018what is a multi-threaded processor?\u2019 and I was not sure whether I was interviewed for an IT job or for a VLSA job?. There is no syllabus for this telephone screening and they could ask anything that pops up in their mind. After the successful telephone screening, you will receive an invitation for face-to-face interview which is a 6 hour long exhaustive and torturous interviews involving questions about all HR related stuff rather then subject matter expert questions. All the interviewers are nice and behave well so that they try their best to boast about the company, work culture, technology etc\u2026 and they make sure that the victim is ready to sacrifice himself after taking the job.\r\n\r\nCompensation: The compensation is not that great when compared to the existing market conditions and Amazon tries to lure the victim in the name of fancy sing-on bonus and employee stock options. Please remember that this is the last time that you will have a chance to negotiate about your salary as once you are in, they know how say no to your repeated requests about your pay reviews in the name of low customer ratings.\r\n\r\nTraining : This is the first step in to the hell is going through the training which is generally taught by the existing guys inside various teams and unfortunately most of them does not have proper education background to teach the stuff and are also forced by the management to train people (if you don\u2019t train, you can\u2019t even show your face to the management while requesting for a pay hike at the end of the fiscal year). As a result the training multiplies your anxiety and you will have sleepless nights with weird dreams about various training sessions that are not organized well and also during the training they clearly inform you that you might need to provide support in case if there are nobody around. As an experienced IT guy, one will definitely think whether it is really possible to support Networking, Storage, CDN, ELB, RDS, EC2 with just 20 mins of Video training and an hour of worthless talk? If it is really possible then it will be easy for a person to come up with another Public Cloud Service like AWS in a matter of days, lol.. The trainings are not well organized and often the advanced stuff is taught before the beginner and intermediate stuff causing lot of anxiety and bad feeling about the job. It is real easy to get demotivated during the training phase itself because of lot of unnecessary information flow and also the trainings are scheduled around lunch time and they don\u2019t even care about your lunch time instead they rudely tell you to take the pain of having lunch during training which does not allow you to concentrate well on training. As a whole the HR, Training people and the immediate manager start showing their  autocracy form day one of training itself and expect that it is going to be multiplied with the time. \r\n\r\nNature of the job : This job is meant for fresh out of the college guys and people having 1 to 2 years of experience, but not for the one who has proven experience in the field for more than 5 years. The job involves in taking customer calls and chat requests and do some sugar coating while responding back to the customer. Please do remember that if you are not a native english language speaker or do not have prior call center experience, the chances of burning your hands or pretty high. The job security purely relies on customer ratings but not on how effective and studious you are in providing the support to the customer. If the customer is pissed off with Amazon, then the only way to vent his/her frustration is by awarding a single star for you which will screw your job security by big time. Also most of the end customers are from SMBs and 90% of the time they don\u2019t have good knowledge about the IT concepts and thus you are expected to take a tutorial class for them about computer science 101. Often the customers expectations are really high even though they are paying minuscule amounts and expecting for a lexus quality and experience. There are not enough people in the support team and thus the calls /  chat requests are piled up causing huge delays and the customers are irritated and end up giving negative ratings on the customer reps which are working hard to provide support at their best. Also one should have good english literature writing experience to shine at this job because that would help a lot in providing feedback to the customer in an obscure way to avoid negative ratings. Intact I came across a guy in database profile who is really good at this and he always concentrates on language rather than presenting the facts to the customer. PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT ANY HANDS ON EXPERIENCE IN THIS JOB and YOU ARE SUPPORTING a PUBLIC CLOUD PRODUCT(s) THAT IS USED BY ONLY SOME PEOPLE IN THE MARKET and thus ONCE YOU LEAVE THIS PLACE, THE CHANCES OF GETTING ANOTHER JOB (mostly hands-on in nature in present day market) is nearly IMPOSSIBLE. \r\n\r\nWork environment : This is the worst work environment I ever came across during my 10+ years of IT experience. It is a poisonous pit and I have not even seen a smiling face on the floor as every one is tensed and pissed off with customer support calls. This is a typical call center environment and often your immediate manager talks about amount the cases and customer ratings and even the all hands meetings are also like this. You will be surrounded by a bunch of people wearing headsets and taking to the customer and if you are not accustomed to call center environment before, you would feel quite demotivated. The telephone calls are often lengthy mixed with various emotions and it is not strange to hear your colleague banging the headset with lot of frustration and despair using \u2018f\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019 words after an exhaustive customer call. You are surrounded by constant chatter and noise and this is not the better place for the people with heavy migraine. You are expected to work on Sundays and also during long weekends making it really hard to balance work and personal life balance. In fact there is ZERO work to personal life balance. If you are married and with kids, then this is not a better job for you as you don\u2019t have time for your spouse and kid to take care of their needs. In a typical corporate company, one can expect at least 9 - 10 company holidays where as in this company you get only 5 - 6 holidays and even during that time you are expected to work based on necessity. \r\n\r\nManagement : You can come across the worst managers in your life at this place. Some of the mangers started their life in one of the fulfillment centers and subsequently transferred to mange the IT professionals. Unfortunately they try to exercise the similar management practices that were used during their tenure at fulfillment center. They don\u2019t know how to respect and motivate a resource. They are always skeptical about a resource and try to micro-manage by exercising excessive control over resources which results in negativity and demotivation. It seems that the HR and top management is aware of the situation and in turn nurture weird management practices. An experienced IT professional with proven track record does not need forceful motivation from his manager in the name of yelling and showing bad gestures. I came across a manager whose slogans are \u201cyou are sleeping\u201d, \u201cyou spent 15 minutes in the break room on so and so day\u201d, \u201cyour lunch breaks are so and so minutes on so and so day\u201d etc\u2026. Unfortunately the list is endless. But still I see that guy is considered as a good manager even after repeated complains to HR.  As a whole the environment is NEGATIVE, REMORSEFUL, HORRIFYING, and REMORSEFUL. If you are moving to Amazon from a good company where people are very optimistic, happy and enthusiastic then this is not the place to continue your career.\r\n\r\n\r\nCareer advancement : AWS is NOT an UNIVERSAL technology and is used by few SMBs in the vast IT market which forced you to limit your skill set rather than expanding.  Also the immediate managers are really worst and they won\u2019t even guide you or pay attention to your career advancement. PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT ANY HANDS ON EXPERIENCE IN THIS JOB and YOU ARE SUPPORTING a PUBLIC CLOUD PRODUCT(s) THAT IS USED BY ONLY SOME PEOPLE IN THE MARKET and thus ONCE YOU LEAVE THIS PLACE, THE CHANCES OF GETTING ANOTHER JOB (mostly hands-on in nature in present day market) is nearly IMPOSSIBLE."}, {"review_title": "Great Company, Smart People, Set Boundaries", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Manager- Software Development in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very Smart People.

Although this is not absolutely necessary, it would be nice to experience every once in awhile\r\n\t- Poor work-life balance usually occurs during your first year here. However; most people are able to get in a groove where they can figure out how to correct this.\r\n\t- Management quality is incredibly inconsistent here. Some are very strong managers, but there are many who are also very weak. This is due to the scaling that has taken place which has resulted in very strong ICs moving into management roles when they are not well-prepared to manage people.\r\n\t- Perks do not compare to Google or Facebook.

I've never seen anything like it at other companies -- the time wasted by senior-level employees dealing with the lowest order tasks out of sheer necessity because there are no assistants and troubleshooting anything takes so incredibly long. To say it's labyrinthine is an understatement. As a marketer, getting even the simplest marketing task accomplished involved dealing with a constant stream of blockers like endless calls with legal, dealing with an insanely slow system to get any outside vendors paid in time, and battling \"computer says no\" at every turn. It's a complete paradox as on the one hand the company is all about thinking big, but on a fundamental level they make it difficult for even very senior people to get out of the weeds of dealing with everyday minutiae. This is why you end up needing to work such long hours as well -- because you're expected to not only deliver on your goals at an executive level, you're also expected to be your own staff handling every little menial chore that someone many levels below you should really be doing. I can appreciate the ideal of such a non-hierarchical and self-sufficient vision but in actual practice it just doesn't work.

In some cases staffing can be barely adequate or inadequate to perform the essential job functions of a department which results in longer hours, irregular schedules, and stressed out employees as they try to fill the gaps and keep up with the workload. Internally, Amazon is a very chaotic place to work. The company is growing and changing so quickly that it's hard to keep up on all of the changes constantly coming down the pike. Ask 3 different people how something should be done and you're likely to get at least 4 different answers. Culture is very building, and even department, dependent and as a result can range from great to unbearable depending on your manager. One universal constant at Amazon though is trial by fire. You can count on your onboarding experience to be akin to trying to drink from a fire hose. If you're a quick learner you'll be fine though.

I get that we have to pick 120 units per hour in order to get the orders out on time, but do you have to remind me every time my rate is low? Just leave me alone and let me do my job. Damn. And every time my rate was low, I always got mad at myself which made me focus on that rather than the task at hand. Also, I didn't like that they started ranking us from the picker with the highest rate to the picker with the lowest rate. Is this a competition?\r\n\r\nTOT \r\nTOT stands for Time Off Task. They calculate TOT from the time you finish a pick to the next time you finish a pick, so if, for instance, you use the washroom. This will not only affect your rate, but your TOT, also. I get it. The less time you spend picking, the less productive you are. I didn't like that everything was timed. Maybe I'm a little salty because ultimately, TOT was what got me fired, but who's to know? \r\n\r\nShort Lunch Break\r\nAnother thing I didn't like was that the lunch break was too short. As a full timer you get a full 30 minute lunch break. FULL 30 MINUTES. Had to make sure the people in the back heard me. By the time I've used the washroom, checked my blood sugar and made my lunch, I have a FULL 15 MINUTES to eat and relax. I know that blood sugar part was personal, but still not enough time for a break.

So, all in all I worked 10.5 hours. As you'd imagine, at the end of the day I'm exhausted and my feet hurt. \r\n\r\nPhysically Demanding\r\nThis is a very physically demanding job. Depending on your schedule, you're on your feet for 5-10 hours. Plus, you have to bend, ascend and descend a latter (as as a full timer who's only 5'2\", I was on a ladder at least 50 times a day), push a cart and sometimes lift heavy grocery bags. As a picker, you have to move pretty fast. Combine that with being in ambient (it's 70 degrees in there) and you'd swear you're in a cardio class. I'd be sweating bullets in there. It was not pretty. \r\n\r\nHaving to Work in Different Temperatures\r\nAmazon fresh has three different picking areas: Chilled, Ambient and Frozen, however they combine these areas to make mixed batches: there's Chilled Ambient, Frozen Chilled and Frozen Ambient. This means that you might have to go from the freezing cold to room temperature in a matter of 30 minutes.

They have shown the world they not only can survive amongst a very competitive landscape, but thrive in a down market.  That is due to world class operations, relentless focus on margin improvement, and a very frugal internal attitude.  As others have mentioned, due to the speed and lean environment, it's somewhat in a disarray internally which leaves mountains of opportunity for self-starters to make immediate impacts to the bottom lines.  Opportunities to move within the company are good and encouraged which expose you to the full scope of the business thus deepening your understanding of how all the pieces fit together, what works, and what does not.", "cons": "The chaotic lean environment.  On the pro side it leaves loads of room for opportunity to make a difference, which is possible.  Just when you think you've made a difference by performing 15 different tasks to accomplish a goal (10 of which were not really yours to do, but you did them because there was no one else to pick it up), everything shifts in frequent re-orgs.  Resources are lost, roadmaps change dramatically, documentation is poor to non-existent, which causes lost momentum that sucks the life out of you.\r\n\r\nThe lack of processes and routines.   This is not true for 100% of the company, but is for many areas that one would think a company of 10+ years would have nailed.  The constant reorganization of teams and leaders breaks any continuity that was established prior to the reorg.  I was dumbfounded when I learned that a certain team in the company had absolutely no idea of the steps it took to issue a payment to a supplier.  I think they thought it was all black magic.  Project processes were another area that some key development teams made up as they went and changed quarterly.  This created loads of knee-jerk reactions for many teams impacted across the company and challenged goodwill with internal relationships.  \r\n\r\nHR could care less about employees.  Loads of lip service from the HR teams to make you think they care. Like many other groups in the company, their individual teams don't seem to talk to one another, or know each other for that matter.  It is as if each team has blinders on and they only know and perform only their function in strict confines.  There is lots of \"that's not my job\" attitudes.  As an example, I witnessed on more than one occasion where great performers took international assignments only to return to leave the company because the company did nothing to help reintegrate the employees.  What I heard is that HR managers and recruiters did nothing to assist these employees returning from their assignments, each one saying it was not their job.  It was left to the employee to figure it out themselves.  So after the company spends tens of thousands of dollars to move staff around the world yet the company expects nothing in return?  How dumb is that?\r\n\r\nBelow market pay.  Amazon is known for paying below market in terms of base salary yet expects people to work at least 50 hours per week.  Many teams due to them being lean require 60+ hours a week.  HR sells the entire compensation package with stock which can be great in a up market and if you live in the US.  The odd thing is the mixed message they send with it: the stock makes you an owner of the company but because they call it comp, they expect you to sell each time you vest.  I would rather have a larger base pay.\r\n\r\nAmazon is no different than other companies in that it has it's own dysfunctions.  If you have an iron will and a high tolerance for stress, you will do well there.

After all, how can you be an awesome/smart/nice person in a dog-eat-dog company where you are encouraged to disregard others while in search of \"data\" or \"the truth\".\r\n\r\n-- New hires, specifically from colleges, are commonly put on a pedestal by management. This is partly because of the experience piece I mentioned above, but also Bezo's and Co deeply believe that being young is a guarantee of innovation, see the leadership principles \"Learn and be curious\" \"Invent and simplify\" \"Biased for action\".  Don't get me wrong, new hires are awesome and people are great - in general, not just at Amazon.  I've personally mentored many Interns and the experience has been rewarding for all parties - but I go out of my way to do right by them as people not just future Amazon employee's.\r\n\r\nAfter breaking down the Darwinian culture a little, this has some side effects that may not be completely obvious, but likely would be to an experienced manager:\r\n\r\n1. With no focus on building a human culture (discounting that people are in fact human), what they mean by \"culture\" at Amazon has nothing to do with finding a groove or alignment to an idea - it has more to do with maintaining a cold demeanor.\r\n\r\n2. A cold demeanor lends itself to override human nature and to become fairly robotic.  Those who are fast at identifying robotic work and pushing it off to other teams are praised, and everyone/team is a target.\r\n\r\n3. Since everyone is a target for things to be pushed on, its easy to make the assumption that others have great intention of malice at first.  However they may not sincerely have this (some do), but because there are soo many teams with this mentality, your day to day experience will bring you lower and lower while they push you to deliver and focus on new things to deliver.\r\n\r\n4. The focus on \"new things\" is easily perceived by existing employees as a challenge to work harder or be left behind, this is also encouraged as Amazonians believe \"we work better under pressure\".  This adds alot of pressure to be sure and does NOT lend itself to a worker with a family/children/relationship that takes more than 20-25% of his/her time outside work - Outside work time is still Amazon time, unless you are a principal.\r\n\r\n5. Principles at Amazon have been here a long time, either because they hold patents from the early days or because they are aggressive.  They often are in positions where they work on special projects that sound grand because they change many systems at once - but if you break it down they are maintenance projects and other work nobody else can do because they lack perspective and deep knowledge of Amazon specific systems as they have not seen the systems evolve.  This perspective can not be hired for as it is specific to Amazon and Amazon systems.  Principals tend to stick around Amazon for that reason and when they do leave they work on similar things outside Amazon or re-create very similar systems. \r\n\r\n6. Out of the org I work with, only VP's and principals have existing relationships and/or children and this would appear to be commonplace (see the former numbers for reasons).  I've seen a large number of people in their 40's just now starting to get married or have kids - these people again either being at Amazon a long time or being Principals who would seem to be untouchable by Management.\r\n\r\n6. You will likely never hear anything like the following from a manager, or possibly a co-worker:\r\n\r\n \"Hey how are you doing?\"- we all blindly shuffle by each other on the sidewalk, if not ignoring each other we are often trying to speak about technical things, convincing others of some fact or trying to gain information for due diligence.\r\n\r\n \"You seem tired, are you ok?\" - No, don't count on hearing this from a manager.  They aren't concerned for you.  You chose to work that 18 hour day, good for you - must be because you didn't scope something properly or didn't estimate your operations load properly.\r\n\r\n \"How can I help?\" - I've done my best to break people of not asking this, encouraging the culture to be helpful - more like the CS people do for Amazon customers (amazing job they do).\r\n\r\n \"I don't understand this, can you help me understand?\" - Assumptions will be made about your presentations by most, and often assumptions that lead people in a bad direction.  You will learn how to pre-empt this and it will consume ALOT more time than you think, all those edge cases that are unlikely.\r\n\r\n \"Can we figure this out together?\" - No, we cant, if you don't drive it, deliver it and promote it yourself you will have a bad review\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\r\n\r\nI'm confident that several trained/motivated Amazonians have read or are reading this, correcting my every mistake and discounting everything here on technicalities; I can't help you - I will go on with my life doing the best I can while meeting new great people on the way. \r\n\r\nIt's true that my best its not good enough, I agree -  something we both have in common as we were hired at Amazon (vocally self critical). I refuse to fail however and not hacking it at Amazon is no failure. We all age, do your best to picture where you will be when you are 55, will you be thinking of Amazon as a positive experience that changed you for the better - or will it be a footnote?\r\n\r\nGreat people don't just accumulate knowledge, knowledge is only a component of greatness but not the root itself.  Greatness is to acknowledge that people are flawed and that we are all in this together.  Great people all have a great need to make a contribution to better humanity, they are driven by this - not by personal appetite and narrow focus -- at least thats the world I fight for."}, {"review_title": "Amazing overall concept; horrible individuals in senior roles", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 May 2016", "job_title": "Operations Manager in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Most customer-centric company I have ever worked for.

This information is for blue-badge members who are full-time. \r\n\r\n1: Starting pay is higher than most general education jobs (almost double the current minimum wage) which starts at $13.00/hr. Pay increases ever 6 months\r\n\r\n2.  On your official start day (and if you have never worked a job that requires you to be on your feet 90% of the time), prepare for this.  Tennis shoes are affordable, but will not fend well on your feet for the first month while you adjust. An investment in Timberland work shoes (around $90-120) are worth the expense, and I found them to be durable, and last at least a year. \r\n\r\n3. Understand your benefits: First and foremost, understand that your schedule is like a contract, meaning the hours that you are schedules must be worked, or supplemented with your benefit hours.  Personal Time Off (PTO), UPT (unpaid time), VTO (voluntary time off), MyLeave  and Vacation are all ways you can make up hours that you may need to miss due to whatever reason. \r\n\r\n-PTO: 48/hrs per year, granted with 10/hrs on the first paycheck of employment or first paycheck of the new year, followed by 3.58/hours for 10 pay periods to follow, with 1.1/hrs on the 12th pay period. These hours can be used at any time. Amazon suggest that you save PTO hours to use during PEAK season (Oct-Dec), as sales are increased, resulting in longer work days and mandatory overtime. \r\n-UPT:  80/hr per year. UPT is granted in 20/hour increments at the start of each quarter (Jan 1, April 1, July 1, Oct 1). UPT is meant for emergency purposes, but can be used as needed. (If an associate used UPT, that will negatively affect their VCP, which will be covered later). \r\n-VTO: is offered by upper management when the labor cost due to lack of orders needs to be reduced. AA's (Amazon Associates) are able to sign up for VTO at the start (or prior day if offered through the HUB, which is Amazon's online employee portal) in which they will be able to leave mid-shift (or whatever time upper management deems fit) without the need to use UPT, PTO. \r\n-MyLeave: is a resource that can be used if AAs need to be absent from work for long periods of time. They must be approved before hand. \r\n-Vacation time: 48/hrs a year. Full-time employees receive 1.53/hrs of vacation time per pay period. Vacation time must be approved by upper management, and cannot be used at any given moment like UPT or PTO. \r\n\r\n***Note: Amazon is firm on the policy of attendance. If you cannot make a shift, it MUST be covered either by PTO, UPT, VTO, or vacation if approved. If an AA goes negative on their UPT, it is an automatic dismissal. Be very cautious about our hours. I know it may seem acceptable to use hours that are available to you, but do not risk your employment due to going negative. Save save save your hours. \r\n\r\n4: The days are extremely long. Most shifts are 10 hours long per day, with 4 days a week (during regular season, peak season is 60 hours per week). Amazon gives it's AAs (2) 15 minute paid breaks (actually 10 minutes with  5 minute walking time to and from your location). Example of my shift: \r\n\r\n0730 - 1000 - Work\r\n1000-1015 - Break \r\n1015-1230- Work \r\n1230 - 1300 - Lunch \r\n1300-1530- Work\r\n1530-1545- Break\r\n1545-1800 - Work \r\n\r\n5: Departments: A break down of each department: \r\n\r\nPick - this is a department to be in if you are comfortable driving PIT (vehicle in which to retrieve items). Mind you PIT can mean going 100+ft in the air to retrieve an item, so if you are not good with heights do not do Pick. \r\n\r\nIC/QA: If you are an introvert and do not mind driving PIT, this is for you. Like pick IC/QA using PIT to tally inventory throughout the FC (fulfillment center). It's a slower paced position, best for those who are not super speedy. \r\n\r\nDock - Very physical department. Mostly being aTetris player by putting boxes into Trucks so they will fit and maximize space. \r\n\r\nInbound: This department receives items into the FC. They drive PIT, separate items to be stored, and other task. Like IC/QA, this department runs a bit slower.\r\n\r\nOutbound/Pack department: This department is to place items to be shipped into boxes. This is the fastest department in the whole FC, and requires a rate of 70 unites boxed per hour. Department is good for those who like a fast-paced environment.\r\n\r\n5: VCP: Variable Compensation Package is a bonus plan Amazon gives AAs who show up for their shifts and do not use UPT, and if the FC is meeting it's goals more than expected: \r\n-Attendance: if you show up to all your shifts(or covered them with vacation or PTO) and do not use UPT, you will receive a 4% bonus for the month. Example: You work 100 hours in the month, took no UPT, and make $13.00/hr, you would receive an addition $52.00. \r\n-Building Too Plan: If an FC is functions 105%+ to plan (meeting it's goals by 5% or more than expected), AAs will receive an additional 4% bonus. Mind you UPT is not calculated for Building Too Plan, so if you use UPT but the building does 105%+ for the month, you will receive this bonus.\r\n***During Peak Season, VCP moves from a potential 8% to 16%.  \r\n\r\n6: If you like a longer 'weekend', choose either front half or back half shifts when selecting. These shifts run 4 days straight with 3 days off (during regular hours(non-peak).

I learned a ton about how tech is developed at scale. Bezos, of course, is a genius. \r\n- The smaller offices that are relatively under the radar have much less \"Amazonian\" culture which, sadly, is a good thing\r\n- Stock price is doing well, meaning RSUs are worth more (although if this means your are above your comp \"target\" they cut down on bonuses, etc. What a great thanks for all the hard work!)\r\n- Very product oriented, meaning you get to more clearly see the business/product impact and motivations behind tech. \r\n- Non-technical people are especially impressed when you say you work at Amazon. To a regular, non-tech person, Amazon seems to be more impressive than Google or Facebook, even though in the tech world the latter are considered more impressive.", "cons": "- Lack of empathy for employees or sense of mission for doing good for the world. This has been a core cultural value from the start, as I learned from \"The Everything Store\" and other histories of Amazon (e.g., Steve Yegge's blog posts)\r\n- Lots of small, employee antagonistic policies--non-competes (I've seen INTERNS have to sign 18 month non-competes), clawing back 2/3 of that year's 401K match when you leave (and it's already an industry low 2%), 5-15-40-40 vesting schedule with the 40s vesting as 20 per 6 months...compare this to the standard 25-25-25-25 vesting schedule with monthly vesting after the first year.\r\n- Rather stingy/subpar benefits compared to other big tech companies\r\n- Inadequate investment in onboarding. Google and Facebook have 4-6 week bootcamps for new engineers. Amazon...has either a 1 day orientation in Seattle (which sometimes they'll fly out people from other offices, sometimes not), or a subpar wiki you follow on your own. \r\n- Lots of janky internal tooling that the company has not invested enough in. Again, I hear about the internal tooling at FB/Google and drool a bit. The downside of a tech company not run by engineers, though the upside is speed and business/product decisions are more emphasized so you can learn more about that.\r\n- Frugality Leadership Principle means inane things like paying interns six figure annualized salaries but not paying $25 for a single checked bag on their flights or Lyfts to the airport, no free food but okay with highly paid engineers spending a long time going out to get lunch, sometimes subpar backpacks, stingy $100 annual employee discount only after you spend $1000 on items shipped and sold from Amazon (which is less than half), no free Prime, etc.\r\n- Warehouse Employees are treated horribly (just Google it), and the little antagonistic policies make it clear they'd treat us engineers like that if they could. Dystopian when Jeff Bezos is the world's richest man\r\n- Corporate and bureaucratic at larger offices\r\n- Kool aid/cult-like obsession with Leadership Principles which end up weaponizing them, since multiple LPs oppose each other (\"Dive Deep\" vs \"Bias for Action\") so just about anything can be justified or opposed via the LPs. Not as bad as the cult around, say, consulting companies like McKinsey but still kinda bad. \r\n- Very inconsistent experiences across teams and orgs. Some teams I was on were absolutely wonderful and amazing, others were miserable. This is true to some extent in all big companies but much more so at Amazon.

Sales growth drives increased network density which improves cost per package fueling more sales growth.  AWS is Amazon\u2019s profit engine while growing rapidly and losing leadership to Azure.  Alexa is strong as well although also looking vulnerable to Google.  With growth comes opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe workforce is young and high energy.  You\u2019ll find sharp folks in all organizations.  Decisions are made quickly especially when reversible.  Jeff is obsessed with delighting customers and long term in his thinking.  Peers tend to be sharp, but a step down from the other tech firms I\u2019ve worked for.\r\n\r\nPay is fine- comparable to other top tech companies but lower after adjusting for cost of living.  Benefits are somewhat typical with the exception of vacation and sick days.  Both lag behind top tech peers.\r\n\r\nThe Seattle campus is beautiful and modern.  There are plenty of food choices including a good food truck scene.  The buildings are dog friendly which keeps things cheery.", "cons": "I joined Amazon because I found that Jeff\u2019s leadership principles and vision resonated with me.  I find those principles poorly lived at Amazon,  My impression is that the company grew too quickly and failed to maintain standards in doing so.  \r\n\r\nFor some context, I\u2019ve worked in high tech since 2000 and have worked for three tech titans, all number one in their fields.  Amazon has lower standards than all three.  I\u2019ve seen the worst tech of my career at Amazon.  I\u2019ve seen the worst data, data management, and systems at Amazon.  The comparisons are quite stark.  Entire tech teams here would have been summarily fired at prior employers.  At Amazon, they linger despite low standards and repeated failures.\r\n\r\nWhile Jeff is quite long term in focus, business unit heads can be very short term.  Emphasis is placed on the number of projects  completed in a given year.  (Congratulations on busy!). However, very little planning is done beyond the current year and next to nothing is discussed on long term vision.  Tech teams design to the current years\u2019 projects which may not be aligned with the long term.  Much of the tech work is wasted year over year.\r\n\r\nRapid growth has led to a very inconsistent culture.  It\u2019s unusual to work with anyone who has been at Amazon more than a couple of years. What is valued becomes subjective with little in the way of common standards for employee assessment.  Managers have nearly unilateral control over performance reviews which creates a culture of manager pleasing.  This leads to bad decisions as employees do not challenge their hierarchy.\r\n\r\nHubris is the Achilles heel of any successful company.  Amazon is no exception.  Folks expect newcomers to be awed.  I was, but not in a good way.  I find the company does little to study and adopt external best practices.  \r\n\r\nThe company practice of raising the bar with each external hire can mean you can find less capable folks at more senior grade levels.   Don\u2019t expect your grade level to change as a result.  You can only be promoted within your current role.  If your boss is not interested in having you as a peer, you\u2019ll have to take a lateral and then earn your promo there.\r\n\r\nSome managers do consistently push their teams to their physical limits.  Health and marital problems are commonplace as a result. I\u2019m the longest tenured team member at one year due to this.  The following three longest in seniority are all looking for other jobs.\r\n\r\nAmazon doesn\u2019t seem to see high turnover as wasteful.  Nothing seems to be done with managers who have 100% turnover every year.  \r\n\r\nLow standards leave little to learn from.

Every person who\u2019s hired after you is your direct competition. The theory is that every new hire has to be better than the existing average (thus \u201craising the bar\u201d), and this combined with high turnover and a stack-ranking employee review process means that the longer you stay, the more endangered your position becomes. Knowing how things work does not outweigh being \u201cgood on paper\u201d and a new hire.\r\n  -  Constant employee turnover. Our team lost its entire marketing department within a six-month period. Senior management blamed this on the team and decided to reorganize. And I\u2019ve seen this happen to at least 3 other departments within 2\u00bd years. It lowers employee morale and makes it incredibly difficult to get anything done, since no one has institutional knowledge extending farther than a year or two.\r\n  -  Chaotic, undocumented, ever-changing processes. All that turnover plus an unhealthy insistence on new launches instead of maintenance & upkeep of existing products means that there is little to no documentation, and you\u2019ll be lucky if you can track down someone who knows how the system is built. This means a lot of emergency trouble tickets and on-call drama for some teams, and a lot of headaches and finding workarounds for others.\r\n  -  Managerial scapegoating at all levels. This can happen to entire divisions, as well as to individuals. If you are working here and having trouble fitting in, now is the time to evaluate your exit strategy.\r\n  -  Capricious, poorly communicated, and barely-planned leadership decisions. For a data-driven company, almost all planning decisions seem to originate in the VP\u2019s gut.\r\n  -  No work-life balance. The only people who get ahead are the ones who ruin their health and sanity by spending all their time in the office. Then they burn out and have to take extended leaves of absence. \r\n  -  Almost no promotion potential. Make no mistake -- they\u2019re hiring externally for the higher-level positions. During the last round of reviews, out of a team of 200+ workers, 5 people rose one level. Mostly from level I to level II. Your raise, if you\u2019re lucky, will be about 1%.\r\n  -  Deceptive compensation messaging. You\u2019re told that your \u201ctotal compensation package\u201d equals $X, but a good third of it is likely in RSUs that only vest after a long time with the company. Remember that employee turnover is such that most people don\u2019t outlast a year or two -- so very few people are going to see the compensation advertised. Despite what they will tell you in the interview, it\u2019s probably a good idea to evaluate the compensation on the base pay, because that\u2019s mostly what you\u2019ll be seeing.

I work 8:30 to 5:00 and am currently not required to work a night shift, which is not common in many warehouse jobs. Weekend overtime is often available and you have a choice between Saturday or Sunday, one half day or a full day. Benefits and perks are very good--Blue Cross health insurance, 401K with company match, stock awards, performance bonuses, occasional free food luncheons, tuition assistance, cash payouts if you decide to leave the company early, ample opportunities for advancement or transfer to other fulfillment centers all over the country. Opportunities for temporary transfer to other facilities to assist in training and startup. There is also a great system of voluntary time off--if the workload slows down you sometimes have the option of leaving early or taking an entire day off. That leaves plenty of available work for those employees who wish to put in their full 40 hours. There is a lot of variety in work tasks. You might alternate between working at least six different functions, which keeps the work fresh and interesting and helps to avoid repetitive injuries.", "cons": "The job is often physically draining because of walking long distances in the warehouse. Wearing high quality shoes and double socks helps to save your feet. You must constantly work at high speed with high accuracy and there can be many obstacles that prevent you from achieving high productivity. Management is reasonable about accepting across the board production declines when there are acknowledged barriers but you must always remain vigilant in keeping up your production numbers or you can be written up. There may be a mandatory requirement to work holidays. The six weeks leading up to Christmas are of course especially demanding."}, {"review_title": "Software Development Engineer", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Apr 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work with talented engineers, flexible hours, interesting problems to solve.
