Company policy sometimes makes keeping up with work difficult, for example floors can only have 2 water spiders maximum and even if we say we need more help company policy says we cannot grab another waterspider. This once led to stations being out of work for 45 minutes as 2 water spiders were responsible for almost 40 stowers. If we had had 2 or even 1 more water spider this would not have been a problem, but it was not allowed. Not enough restrooms in the warehouse for the amount of employees we have, outside of break rooms there are around 4 per floor each with 1-2 stalls leading to long wait times. Spend too long waiting effects and it effects your takt time leading to productivity concerns and writeups."}]]
