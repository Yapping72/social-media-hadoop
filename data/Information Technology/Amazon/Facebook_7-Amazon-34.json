There's also no reasonable time at any point in the shift to take a lunch break, and it is part of the culture that managers don't really get a break.\r\n\r\nLastly, I was drawn to the opportunity by the promise of growth opportunities. I was told the avg L4 Area Manager could expect a promotion within 9-13 months, but this is HIGHLY dependent on your station and the performance of your supervisor. Yet, I was strung along and asked to perform WAY above my job function with direct promises of a promotion that never came (i.e: working 17 hour days, delivering packages on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, Taking on L6 responsibilites as an L4, etc.)"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Sept 2021", "job_title": "ECommerce Manager in Irvine, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is where you want to be if you are in E-Commerce", "cons": "Can be very fast-paced.

This is good for resume building as AWS usage is marketable in general.\r\n- The notorious \"Leadership Principal\" can be either a curse or a blessing. From a career perspective though, it does do a good job of turning shy, non-vocal engineers into vocal can-do engineers who can lead. The industry seems to be abundant of the former.\r\n\r\nSummary: I think Amazon's good qualities pale in comparison to other competitors, but objectively it isn't as bad as the young-ins make it out to be. It's more so that companies like Google and Facebook are raising the bar in employee satisfaction, where as Amazon hasn't changed too much because it doesn't really drive up their profits. Instead what they do to incentivize employee retention is to give a stock vesting plan that rewards you exponentially near the end of your 3-4 year term. This means you don't really get squat for leaving within the first year, but in the later years you get rewarded handsomely.", "cons": "- They are stingy on pay, as millions of others would probably say (unless your offer came from negotiation wars)\r\n- The \"Leadership Principal\" can actually make teams more toxic and overall just unpleasant to maintain\r\n- Some orgs have unfulfilling grunt work as an engineer and are not great for career growth. AWS is no better either unless you're working for a niche team.\r\n- Work life balance can be a hit or miss depending on your org and team. In my case, this wasn't an issue, but it is safe to say that Amazon as a whole doesn't really care about your work life balance that much.\r\n- Perks are again, not \"bad\", but really lackluster compared to other competitors. You don't even get Prime membership for free, and you get a discount code that only works on select products.\r\n\r\nSummary: Amazon's culture is like a double edged sword. The leadership principles can make you grow as an engineer in soft skills and also as a leader. The cost of that is the breeding of \"toxic\" cultures, where everyone is only looking out for themselves and feels the need to step on someone else's shoes because its an area for growth. This eventually leads to everyone having an \"alpha\" mindset towards each other for the sake of being \"alpha\"; even if there isn't a visible need for improvement, teams create one anyway. \r\n\r\nAnother thing to mention is the work life balance. In my opinion, the idea of having a perfect work-life balance WITH a career rewarding role is extremely rare. Typically, you would either end up with a role that does a lot of good for your resume but with intense amount of hours per week, or a role that doesn't do much for your resume but have a perfectly nice work-life balance. In other words, its not impossible to attain good skillsets or have a reasonable work life balance here - it just boils down to your luck on teams.\r\n\r\nLast thing is compensation - most people only stay up to the 4 year mark because that is when their stock vesting plan pays off. The sign-on bonus usually runs out before the half way mark of the vesting plan. Once your stock vesting is done, you may be eligible for a pay refresh, but at that point its probably better off joining another company if you want higher pay."}, {"review_title": "o", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Program Manager Internship in Beijing, Beijing", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good teamwork, working environment, highly intelligence", "cons": "I don't think there are any cons."}], [{"review_title": "o", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Program Manager Internship in Beijing, Beijing", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good teamwork, working environment, highly intelligence", "cons": "I don't think there are any cons."}, {"review_title": "Work life balance", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "26 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Senior Compliance Analyst in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance is good", "cons": "No cons has found in amazon"}, {"review_title": "Next Level", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Logistics Employee in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Financial Assistance with your career choice", "cons": "Very tasking and too much work"}, {"review_title": "Nice Companay", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Customer Service Associate in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Work culture to work", "cons": "Growth opportunities are less in the company"}, {"review_title": "Amazon Planner", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Demand Planner in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fast paced, busy environment, with room to learn.", "cons": "Not enough structure, many unknowns and too much decisions outside your control."}, {"review_title": "Okay but takes a toll on body", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Associate in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good pay incentives, can move up pretty quickly if you're willing.", "cons": "can get boring at times"}, {"review_title": "Dont work here", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Delivery Associate in Lutz, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They will hire anyone without question ni matter the experience you have.

Opportunity for a lot of growth as an engineer, with so much access to internal wikis, code repos, internal videos, internal training, etc.", "cons": "If you have a bad manager then your life can be hell. As in my case, they may lie to your face about your performance and then PIP you so that they have a paper trail to justify firing you. If this happens, you are blocked from internally transferring, and you at at your manager\u2019s mercy for ever working at Amazon again since they can choose to blocklist you once you quit/get fired. Another issue related to work politics is favoritism; some people clearly get promoted because the manager likes them more, even when there are others who have proven themselves more capable. Amazon claims it is a data-driven company, but when it comes to career growth, it\u2019s more about how much your manager likes you. Behavior like this is only encouraged from upper management due to Amazon\u2019s annual or biannual \u201corg level restricting\u201d meetings, which call for the bottom 10% of engineers to be put on a dev plan (precursor to PIP). Half of those people tend to get PIP\u2019ed and subsequently let go. Multiple times, I have seen coworkers, as well as myself, get thrown to the wolves from this process, even when there is feedback in writing from other teammates that directly contradicts it. This toxic practice has led to some very talented engineers leaving Amazon permanently. Another con is that they expect you to work extra hours. Don\u2019t be surprised to find yourself working extra hours and weekends, and still feeling like you aren\u2019t doing enough. Work life balance can be a challenge to maintain. Also, not very many woman work here. I\u2019ve been on multiple teams that have a toxic \u201cbro culture\u201d, with mansplaining happening to the one or two women on the team. HR is hit or miss on being helpful, usually siding with the manager. If your manager is an ally, great.
