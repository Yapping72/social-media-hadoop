Management was okay, they tried, but didn't do enough, and people don't like to follow rules. Whole foods employees and asking for help, well that's another story. Add Wholefoods employees with QR CODES WHEN REPLACING ITEMS, NO BUENO LOL!!! Some of them don't even work, they just sweep up a little trash to make it seem like they're working and then proceed to fool around. I had to leave voluntarily leave to catch my breath, I said duces, i'm out. But I need a job, so I'm going back, but to a different location, it really depends on your site. Had fun while it lasted.
