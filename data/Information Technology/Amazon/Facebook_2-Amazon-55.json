Associates were running into each other during the picking process, it was a mad house. Once the amazon drivers came into the warehouse, it got even worse with the loud honking and loud voices of drivers and coordinators make you feel rushed. I was never told during the training videos that we would have to preform a task that was called \u201cbagging\u201d , which is a job in itself. Once my shift was over I just followed the crowd and my trainer never communicated with me that it was ok to clock out or even located me to make sure I was ok. Amazon missed a huge opportunity to make a new employee feel better for that horrendous day of labor. Just a simple acknowledgement from leadership would have helped me to at least feel like they gave a damn that I was breaking my back to get my work done as well as others, and this was day one. For me that broke the straw on the camels back. At that moment I made my decision that I would not return or deal with Amazon ever again.

You know why you're doing something and that helps you make decisions faster, easier and more efficiently.\r\n\r\nThe company is growing, aggressive and I believe the only company able to withstand Apple. The company genuinely cares about customers - that's not rhetoric. You can find an Amazon engineer at 3:00am in the morning, shake them out of deep sleep, drug them and ask them why a certain decision was made. Whether they're on-guard or off-guard, the answer won't change. If something impacts customers in a positive way, it will be done.", "cons": "The above pro can become a minor con since there is little to non-existent romanticism about any type of work.

Some managers are so afraid of making mistakes or causing customer complains, that they'd rather take mediocre baby steps rather than addressing the root causes. The company has a slogan: Amazon does not believe in Big Bang, which is totally understandable, but this is sometimes used as excuses for taking short cuts, making safe bets, and rewarding mediocre. \r\n\r\nIf Amazon pays so much attention to operation, you'd imagine that they would put much focus on QA, but ironically, QAs virtually do not exist at Amazon. The end result is that many Devs spend so much time fighting with the legacy system rather than building the new ones. I simply cannot understand the rationality of hiring top-notch Devs to push buttons, handling customer requests, and trivial bug fixes with over 6-digit salaries. Sure, any SDE job would come with a list of not-so-interesting tasks, but I haven't felt so mundane at my previous jobs, so I don't know.\r\n\r\nFinally, the immigration service at Amazon is horrible. That only costs you a few thousand dollars, which is a tiny fraction of a SDE salary and your operation cost. Why don't you fix it so your International employees can spend less time worry about their GC and spend more time working for you?"}, {"review_title": "Excellent Place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jan 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have worked in Seattle for Amazon the past 2 years.
