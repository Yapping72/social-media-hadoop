Managers began to practice heavy in favoritism and upper management began asking for more and more as they should in an ever growing company like Amazon. However, they would demand and no manager would ever show backbone(one of the company standards) and state that certain things where necessary before productivity increased.  They would agree to increase the burden on their corresponding departments try to survive for a year or half because that's all they had to last before they were transferred or promoted, leaving the mess they left to lower management(process assistants, shipping clerks, even the oncoming area manager sent to replace them). I witnessed an entire department fall in my years there and become notorious. I showed backbone not because I was fighting back, but because I was passionate about my job and just wanted to see my department succeed. I don't believe a company can be evil, but my latter time at Amazon was some of the most frustrating and horrendous  years of my life and it bothers me to this day still how people are treated in the building known as Ont2."}, {"review_title": "Not for everyone", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Dec 2018", "job_title": "Area Manager in Opa-locka, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working at Amazon is not for everyone.

The startup culture that existed in the early days is also not as prevalent, which can make staying motivated somewhat challenging when surrounded by people of varying levels of motivation.  In the technical career track, Amazon does a pretty poor job developing and enabling the growth of their employees, aside from the very early stages of an engineers career, unless the employee is inclined to move into a management track.  This lack of career development can be compounded by the large operational responsibilities of many teams, which makes it difficult for engineers to find the time to interact with groups outside of their general are and explore other opportunities that could help foster career growth."}], [{"review_title": "Good, Okay, or Terrible Depending on the Team", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "10 Feb 2019", "job_title": "Developer in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stock value keeps going up and up and up. \r\nDecent benefits, but not the best. \r\nCompetitive pay.\r\nEmployment stability- generally you really have to screw up to get totally fired.\r\nEasy to transfer internally, and an internal transfer is often like an entirely new job. \r\nDefinitely room to grow skills and try any new project you would like to. \r\nBetter than average response to ADA accommodation requests.
