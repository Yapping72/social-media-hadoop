Big problems - At Amazon, no problem is pushed aside as too hard to solve. In fact, they go after the really hard and insolvable problems and then throw talent, time and resources towards solving them. In my time there, pretty much every team I worked with was solving a \"holy grail\" problem in their field and actually making progress towards it. There is no dearth of interesting projects, teams or ideas to work on. 2. Structure and thinking - There is a lot of document writing at Amazon, in case you have not heard. While some people do not like that part of the job much, I think the required meetings and documents force every employee to truly think about their job and what they are doing. Producing the write-ups and getting them ready to face up to a room of very detailed scrutiny and questioning forces you to think through every aspect of your business. it is really a very valuable skill that Amazon does a great job of developing. 3. Ownership - Amazon treats you like an owner - a grown up. You have a job to do and you are empowered to do it. There are checks and balances, of course, but you truly do own your business. You make the assessments, take the risks, justify your decisions and ultimately reap the benefits or learn from your mistakes and move on. There are not many fall-backs and layers to catch you if you are not moving your business forward. Not a lot of finger poitning for failures either, that I saw. In fact, I would say that if you do not act like an owner, you will not be successful at Amazon. You have to embrace the responsibility and run with it. 4. Smart People - You'll hear this a lot and personally, I think some of the talk is overblown but Amazon does indeed have some very, very smart and talented people working there. I know its a cliche, but I did learn a lot from most people I worked with there - and again, I say, most, not all :-) are just genuinely nice people. I would work again with these people without hesitation. I think the leadership there is especially great - just really smart, experienced people with sharp instincts, great insights and lots of ambition. It was really fun working with the folks I did.", "cons": "Cons 1. Structure and documentation - What I said above about structure and documentation, while its great to create clarity and shape your thinking, it can get in the way of actually doing your work. Everybody at Amazon is juggling so much and constantly writing high quality documents can get exhausting. The secret here, as in any job, is to balance the strategic against the operational and prioritize ruthlessly. I cannot say I was always effective at it - but I tried till my last day and now have the benefit of hind sight as well :-) 2. Culture - I think some people could have a tough time adjusting to the culture - its tough, expectations are high and there is not always a lot of hand holding ( in fact, it would be very rare). I think you have to embrace or at least accept it and focus on the positives. Your team makes a huge difference - so hopefully you're lucky and end up with a great manager and great team mates. If you're looking for free food and onsite massages - you certainly will be disappointed. You can end up overworked and resentful if you are not good at prioritizing your work and your life and making trade-offs. 3. People/Politics - I started to see a lot of the \"we are the best in the world\" mentality start to show up. I don't believe that everyone that works at Amazon is a genius and seeing that attitude crop up every now and then was annoying. Every company has inside politics and even though Amazon tries really hard to believe there is no politics, there is certainly that to deal with. No more than any other company that I can tell, but it can get frustrating when you're working so hard and so long to get derailed by that kind of thing. So there you have it - overall I loved my time at Amazon. I was exhausted (in a very good way) every day but couldn't wait to go back and keep making progress. I was lucky to have a great team, a really interesting area to work on and some awesome problems to tackle."}, {"review_title": "Easy work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Warehouse Associate in Plymouth, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I enjoy the ease of work.

During peak there is a termination FREEZE. Due to volume needs, you can pretty much get away with anything. I wish I was lying. Another major con is that there are instant termination causes and depending on who caught you screwing up, you can either still have your job, or not. Why does this suck? Because it's completely subjective and has nothing to do with your quality as an employee most of the time. Favorites are a thing, But if you're one of those lucky few that get away with everything, good onya. Another very large con is consistency in messaging. There is a very large problem with communication - it either doesn't happen, happens in a vacuum, or isn't disseminated throughly leaving staff and teams on completely different pages and eventually causes severe breakdowns in the flow of work. Along with inconsistent messaging, they also have a habit of over promising and underdelivering for their staff. Roles are promised and never materialize. Raises are promised and don't happen. It's not everywhere all the time, but I've trained multiple level 4-5 managers as a level 1 and was often put in situations where my work well exceeding my role and salary.

During peak there is a termination FREEZE. Due to volume needs, you can pretty much get away with anything. I wish I was lying. Another major con is that there are instant termination causes and depending on who caught you screwing up, you can either still have your job, or not. Why does this suck? Because it's completely subjective and has nothing to do with your quality as an employee most of the time. Favorites are a thing, But if you're one of those lucky few that get away with everything, good onya. Another very large con is consistency in messaging. There is a very large problem with communication - it either doesn't happen, happens in a vacuum, or isn't disseminated throughly leaving staff and teams on completely different pages and eventually causes severe breakdowns in the flow of work.

This fact flies in the face of a supposed hallowed IT tenet, \"lean\" structure. Whatever type of company the B-man intended to create, it is not flat. Independent, self-directed work is tolerated up to a point, but it eventually gets funneled through a micro-managed sieve of oversight, mainly due to the fact there are so many managers in need of justifying their existence. \r\n\r\nSecond, we were a team of knowledge workers supporting legal and regulatory compliance requirements during Amazon's rollout of its dedicated road logistics operations, being led by managers with community college diplomas and GEDs recruited from Fed-Ex and Amazon FCs. \r\n\r\nIt quickly became a farce within a firestorm of mis-management inside incompetence wrapped in angst and distrust. Of course (it became apparent) Amazon had a two- or perhaps a three-way door built into this highly risky and costly bet, and in retrospect our team, along with the venture itself, was a longshot to make the backstretch. \r\n\r\nAmazon pulled the plug on any aspect of owning it's own fleet of dedicated drivers before year-two of my stay. Despite this decision, delivery and logistics and its runaway costs is still the fly in the chardonnay of the company's hope to ever achieve a consistent, substantial profit in its retail operations. \r\n\r\nAnd so much for the frugality myth.

During Peak last year I was working 65 hour work weeks with no overtime and no night differential. We were expected to put in 3x the work during the holiday season without any real benefit. As a manager, you don't get the perks that hourly employees get like two breaks, overtime, holiday pay, and any other benefits throughout the year. Management is separate from associates and has unbelievably high expectations for compensation that is.... let's say, not reflective of the work. It is no wonder the turnover is so high. The first 6 months of my job, I didn't take a lunch break because it was frowned upon to ever be off the floor. The second part of my tenure, I made sure I took a 30 minute break every night to eat and escape the craziness, but they told me that I shouldn't leave the building. Policing. I can't even describe how much of my time was wasted policing associates. I felt like a high school principal trying to get students in trouble. If you didn't give out enough written warnings every night, you had to go out of your way to look for people doing something wrong. So instead of helping my associates with problems they faced day to day, or working to achieve long term goals with them, or dedicating any time to fix the endless mechanical and technical problems faced on the daily, I had to spend my time going around my department trying to catch someone on their phone, or off task, or not doing their job in some other way. I used to have to go through everyone's time cards from the day before, find the people off task the most, and spend my time reprimanding the few strays who weren't doing their job, effectively ignoring the needs of all the associates who show up and do the right thing everyday. It was ridiculous and what made me lose my connections with the people, and therefore my work. Turnover. You could never get comfortable. As soon as you had a routine there were new associates, or new managers, or new ways to do the process, or new rules, or new write ups you had to give. It is a constantly revolving door that goes around and around without making any real progress. People were fired every day, and new people came in practically every week. No adjustment period, no getting comfortable, just work and work and work and pick up the pieces along the way. \"Do your best!\" they'd say, \"But I need to see more results\". I was constantly putting out fires on a sinking ship. Management. I was at Amazon for a little over a year, and I saw a multitude of leadership transitions. It's very cut-throat and I lost too many good leaders who moved to other jobs after not getting their well-deserved promotion. On the contrary, I had too many managers who were insufficient at their jobs and stayed in leadership positions simply because they were willing to be miserable for a paycheck. They cared about themselves, their careers, their opportunities, and ABOVE ALL, how YOU made them look to THEIR bosses. I would be on the floor, making real time quick decisions based on what I thought was best for the associates and operation, and I would be reprimanded because some higher up across the country looking at a screen of data, didn't like that decision, didn't think it was worth it, didn't see the positive result in the performance data. I constantly had to compete safety with performance instead of wholly prioritizing safety and putting performance on the back burner until the situation is resolved. Amazon is a giant company, and unfortunately, to a giant company, its all a numbers game. I used to defend Amazon, I wanted to be the difference, I wanted to change the narrative.... boy was I naive. I quickly learned that I was caring for my people way more than any manager was caring for me. And that being a good leader didn't get you recognized or praised, being a good manager did. A good manager does the reports on time and listens to their boss and does what is best for the company. A good leader looks out for their people and creates a team environment in which we can all thrive. I created a beautiful synergy in my first department on my own, I was a great leader and the associates would tell you they loved me. In my second department, I wasn't given the time or freedom to create meaningful relationships and was forced to go into strictly manager mode. Listen to your boss and do what you're told, even if you don't think its the right thing to do for the people. Working with people, especially the number of people I was working with (100+), requires a certain level of nuance. I was working with all different ages, ethnicities, backgrounds, and financial situations, and as easy as it would be to throw a blanket over everyone and treat them the same, there's no equity in that. Maybe it just wasn't the job for me, but I used to love it... As soon as I was forced to set my morals aside for the betterment of the company, I knew I was out."}, {"review_title": "Learn new things", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Manager II in Chennai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to learn new things every day and you have opportunities to join different roles in different programs and location which is little difficult outside", "cons": "Difficult to manage work life balance unless you are very good at it"}, {"review_title": "Choose your team wisely", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Technical Product Manager in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Great Benefits -Very data driven -Great Affinity Groups", "cons": "-Managers don't always know your role -Managers may not be invested in your growth at all -Lot's of bureaucracy, as expected (takes a long time to get approvals/launch products) -Downleveling"}], [{"review_title": "Amazon", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Training Specialist in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best culture and team.

High expectations and performance pressure. Amazon has high expectations for its employees and expects them to perform at a high level. This can create pressure for employees to constantly deliver and can be stressful for some people. Intense competition. Amazon is a highly competitive company, and employees may face intense competition for promotions, opportunities, and recognition. This can create a cutthroat atmosphere and may not be conducive to a positive work environment for some people. Limited opportunities for career development.
