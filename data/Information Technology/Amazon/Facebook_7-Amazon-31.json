There are annoying technical glitches that happen with my station, sometimes the pods with the items arrive slow, and sometimes amnesty stops my area to fix something and all these issues stall my rate. While the latter two are out of managements control, some of the stations on my floor feel like they've been neglected. Sometimes the buttons don't work, the tote-lifter falts for whatever reason, the release break that holds the totes back gets stuck, and there's even been a couple of times where the problem couldn't even be identified."}, {"review_title": "Unfortunate Trend Identified", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Operations Manager in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Competitive culture throughout partnered with direct engagement with associates is great environment for those that enjoy working with others.", "cons": "Amazon has an online organization chart we use called phonetool. Cool thing about this application is you can add adons that will showcase more data for viewers. One I've added has been job tenure & roles so I can see when looking at peers and other Amazonians profiles. A very common trend that is too apparent to overlook in the amount of time employees of color spend in their roles compared to white counterparts. I literally have AAs who came into the company as Tier 1s that have progressed faster than myself and other black counterparts whom come in with a degrees and as entry level management. Statically speaking on average black employees spend 1.5 -2 years in their roles prior to progression when the average progression within the company is 1 - 1.5 years. \nSo being a white male or female you can literally have no formal secondary education and work within amazon and progress faster than a black employee with a degree that was hired into management. I have personally worked in the company for 3 years with nothing but high marks from all my direct managers with very minimum to no negative feedback and have been given many hoops to jump through. Example I was told at one site I had to learn inbound and outbound before coming a level 5 manager to only find out I had level 7 seniors that had progressed and only been in 1 side of the business their entire career. Also noticed their is certainly a \"boys club\" if you are liked by senior team I've seen people pulled to positions that were never posted and promoted when being in the role for only a few months. It's extremely frustrating to work in an environment that says they promote growth & not having a glass ceiling and seeing blatant trends of discrimination."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Instructional Designer in Barcelona", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The work culture, work life balance and flexibility is great", "cons": "It takes time to get used to the pace of work"}], [{"review_title": "Great place To Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Training and Quality Specialist in Coimbatore North", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to start your career with and to grow. folks are really helpful.", "cons": "Too much competition in growth. have to strive your way up"}, {"review_title": "no work life balance", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Human Resources Business Partner in Jacksonville, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "you work with some interesting people - sometimes", "cons": "once you are in, it takes forever to get promoted \nno work life balance\nconstant expectation to do more, feeling of never doing enough\nconstant calls, instant messages on the weekend when you are supposed to be off, you are pressured to respond 24/7 \nyou are responsible for all kinds of metrics and have to speak to them on calls while being constantly disrupted by associates and expected to resolve their issues all at the same time, they can walk in anytime and you are expected to serve them immediately\nespecially AMZL - one HRBP doing the work of whole team because that 2 person is the whole team"}, {"review_title": "Good Job for People that dont care about getting taken advantage off", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Area Manager in Rialto, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "3 Days Weekends. \nMoving Positions.", "cons": "Long crucial hours\nNo sitting. \nStanding 10-12 hours \nNot Organized \nNo overtime pay since you are salary"}, {"review_title": "Data center technician", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Data Center Technician II in Ashburn, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "freedom to be innovative, speak freely, minimal micro managing (depending on your manager), able to work with other teams to learn/growth, great compensation package.", "cons": "Once you hit a ceiling there are no clear career paths, a lot of bureaucracy, for growth/promotions you are capped at a certain \"level\" or tier unless you move out of the organization or quit.
