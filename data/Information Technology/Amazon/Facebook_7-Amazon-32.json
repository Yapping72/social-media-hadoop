Because it's \"hourly\" you get paid weekly and can avoid being overworked.\r\n\r\n3. The benefits are so good because of how huge the company is.\r\n\r\n4. I did have a wonderful team and manager that genuinely cared about me.", "cons": "1. The entire talent acquisition organization is a hot mess. None of the recruiting lanes have the same procedures and duties. Every person's work is defined differently and takes on different duties. Doesn't seem like a big deal until you're helping someone that supports a different lane from you and it takes you an extra 30 minutes to an hour to schedule on their jobs because procedures are that different. \r\n\r\n2. There is SO MUCH turnover and movement in both senior management and at the individual level. This makes it difficult to keep procedures in place and even define who does what. \r\n\r\n3. Training is spotty, unorganized, and dependent on you having a good team and \"onboarding buddy.\" Many things are repeated while others are left out. No basic training manual that is organized for everyone. \r\n\r\n4. Your success and experience is LARGELY determined by your manager. To even get promoted (the ONLY way you get paid more) is for your manager to write a 6 page paper. Amazon really loves papers for anything you want to suggest/change, and honestly this doesn't help push change along. \r\n\r\n5. Career progression is not as promised. In a recruiting coordinator role the only way to progress is to move to another role (like a recruiter for example). You must interview internally for the same level position you enter at. Meaning you have to interview (another 4 hours of straight behavioral interviewing) for another level 4 position (level 4 is the only level you can be hired at as a recruiting coordinator). This seems fine, until you find out you will get paid the SAME in the new role, even though you're working harder, are likely now base salaried (no overtime), and have different responsibilities. This makes ZERO sense. The worst part: if they hired you as a level 4 sourcing recruiter role from the outside, they would pay you $20k-$30k more! Why would I stay and interview internally to get paid the same as someone hired from the outside. They are really not set up for keeping people and growing them within the company.\r\n\r\n6. Annual \"compensation\" review is not what is pitched during interview. This year almost none of the recruiters got a pay raise, even with great reviews, because Amazon argued that the stock went up so their overall compensation increased. Funny thing is, the average tenure of a recruiting coordinator is 11 months, yet the stock doesn't fully vest for 4 years. So you're not making more money when the stock goes up, because you don't own the stock yet. The problem is they pitch that there is a raise, and yet the results are not the same. \r\n\r\n7. If you're conservative, run. This is an extremely liberal company. In the pursuit of being diverse and inclusive, Amazon has taken it WAY too far. They're very exclusive to anyone that is not liberal. If you're liberal, you'll probably love it.\r\n\r\n8. A lot of time is being wasted on duplicate efforts. Seems like there is a D&I team in every department and on every team. And the same could be said on many other efforts. Amazon is big enough to have entire departments spearheading these efforts, yet everyone else is trying to make teams and committees to also do things. It's a waste of time and energy on everyone's part.\r\n\r\n9. Compensation is not competitive with other companies in the market. The sign on bonuses seem great at first, until you realize the only way you'll make more money once those are up is to get promoted. \r\n\r\n10. The interview process to get into Amazon is so bad. You spend 2 hours doing only behavioral interviewing and get maybe 15--20 minutes total to ask about Amazon and the role. While I understand the importance of some behavioral interviewing, it's not the only way to assess someone's success in the role. And you also don't know what you're walking into at Amazon because you haven't really been given the chance to ask. If I had the chance I likely would have flushed out much of what I've written above, and I would not have accepted the offer.\r\n\r\nIf you have any experience in recruiting, I'd honestly stay away. It's much too broken and while they are open to change it requires 5 papers to get anything done. They grew much too fast and didn't build out the recruiting department fast enough. Candidate experience is constantly preached, but candidates are handled so poorly (by interviewers and recruiters). This isn't a problem in every department, but when candidate experience is taught as the number one important thing, you can't let it fall by the way side as much as happens."}, {"review_title": "A lot of corporate headache nonsense", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Program Manager in Herndon, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay, interesting work, fast-paced", "cons": "The work doesn't matter, just everyone's ability to be given credit for work and be noticed.
