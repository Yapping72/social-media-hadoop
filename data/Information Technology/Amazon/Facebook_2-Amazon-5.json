I am resentful, but I have good reason to be, all you have to be is charismatic in interviews to move up, but suck at your job after the interviews are over. You will do 3 different jobs, all for credit and pay as a L1. If I actually worked for Opstech instead of the FC, I could just promo my way into the next level, but no as a tier 1 warehouse associate, they are basically getting free work out of you and you get paid in experience. Hire more people, increase the pay of L1's working in IT, delegate the work instead of having the staff fight over what is expected of them (this should be clearly stated and demonstrated from the beginning.)
