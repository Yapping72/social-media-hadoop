Many that work there know this and use it to get other coworkers terminated. This has created a toxic environment that Thermo Fisher's headquarter HR department fully endorses. Investigations of accusations typically go in favor of the accuser unless there is substantial evidence to the contrary. In other words, guilty until proven innocent. Since employees are hired on an \"at will\" basis, investigations are done poorly, without follow up. HR investigators, even ones at Senior Management level do not investigate to find out the truth, they investigate strictly in risk managemnent fashion. In other words, they investigate biasedly in favor of which ever side takes action to successfully intimidate their HR department with potential lawsuites, even if the lawsuites would be far fetched. I repeat, investigations are unfair and biased strictly based on risk management regardless of the truth. Thermo Fisher Scientific is so bold in doing this, they don't even try and hide it. Because it's technically not against the law, ethics go right out the window to the point of abusing and misusing the \"at will\" policy that strictly protects employers. Thermo Fishers Scientific's HR (Human Resources) does not perform their job properly and only gives the appearance of performing investigations to insure their \"risk management\" approach isn't grossly being mishandled. \u2022 Thermo Fisher Scientific fully embraces the concept of, \"you're just a number\" is ingrained into the culture provideing a very toxic environment in departments with less than superior management talent.

The manager is easy manipulated and pulled in many directions and will project all that on you then come to you with the latest gossip or group feelings. It\u2019s very unsettling and I hate when managers do that because this leads to so many more issues between coworkers and attracts the wrong people to become involved in the work. Likewise many of the inexperienced new hires straight from grad school have a very egotistical and selfish attitude and will try to stop you from receiving recognition for your work by inserting themselves into your business and taking over projects. They will not acknowledge your work, take credit for it, and will not work with you. All these behaviors are overlooked by the group as a whole because it\u2019s the culture to scheme to get the chosen ones in place. And these Coworkers are very nosy and seek constant validation. This place is not the ideal working situation because coworkers are mirco managing each other too and overwork themselves instead of sharing the responsibility. The smart ones try to avoid it but the crabs in the barrel will keep trying to pull you down back into the toxicity.

As a result, even if you go to toilet or pouring a glass of water, it's expected from you, to give a full-report, where you at, even if there's literally no work to do. 2) Thermo Fisher Germany decided to make their corporate language, German and English, so the worker are prohibited to speak in another language while working. Around half of the staff are French background. As I noticed personally, but was told by other co-workers too, worker with French background speak all the time in french while working around their supervisor with no consequences, while other employees, who aren't french background are immediately reminded of the corporate language, whenever they speak in their native language. This is direct discrimination in favour of french speaking people. Either the rule of speaking in corporate language has to apply to all employees or nobody. 3) Even though Thermo Fisher Germany is not producing any pharmaceuticals, they are working for pharmaceuticals companies as a logistic firm. Wages are too low in comparison to pharmaceutical companies, even in comparison to logistic firms such as DHL (the biggest logistic firm in Germany/Europe). 4) Thermo Fisher Germany is outsourcing their employees from multiple different recruitment agencies. Those agencies are not communicating open with their employees before signing contract, about working conditions in Thermo Fisher, such as, you may work in the fridge as a pick and packer or having to take two days crash-course in a total different location, than the location you supposed to go to work. In this case, the cost for transportation is not paid by Thermo Fisher. For example, i had to ride a bike at freezing cold more than one and a half hour at six in the morning, for only getting to the location, where the course take place. 5) Another problem with outsourcing employees from multiple different recruitment agencies is, that the wage are all over the place for the same position, what i found very frustrating. Because i have to do the same job for less money than another employee, who signed a contract with a different recruitment agency. Either, they should outsource their employees from one single recruitment agency or make sure, employees getting the same amount of money for the same position."}, {"review_title": "WLB", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Senior Compliance Engineer in Sunnyvale, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stable company, structure, operation, direction & vision.", "cons": "Lacks good & competent management in some org groups."}, {"review_title": "Understaffed", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Quality Specialist in Haverhill, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Challenging and telework is great.", "cons": "Not enough people in my department to get the job done."}], [{"review_title": "warehouse work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Warehouse Worker in Suwanee, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good benefits and pay along with friendly team to be apart of", "cons": "have to stay after 8 hours on some days"}, {"review_title": "Excelente", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Learning Specialist in Ciudad de Mexico", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Life work balance at all times", "cons": "None at the moment. all good"}, {"review_title": "Great place with benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "17 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Scientist III in Carlsbad, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of benefits and opportunity for growth", "cons": "Large company with lots of bureaucracy"}, {"review_title": "Great Company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Sales Representative in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Tons of resources and support within the organization.

It is next to impossible to get promoted within your current group, if you want to move up a level you are all but forced to switch departments. This has led to most departments having a sever lack of tenured employees to act as mentors for people newer to the role. Management, specifically on the Operations side, positions are treated like musical chairs and it is rare to find someone that has held the same management position for more than 2 years, this has led to a culture in which new managers are concerned only with hitting their own metrics to look good for a future promotion and disincentives making their departments better. It takes an unacceptable amount of time to fill a position with external candidates.
