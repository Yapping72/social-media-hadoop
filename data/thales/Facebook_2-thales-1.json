Benefits were reduced without the option to opt into a a plan that was more expensive but with the same coverage. \r\nBoring projects. While there are interesting projects, there are also very boring projects that makes work feel like a sweat shop. \r\nProject management. I've notice that the company is big on piling tons of work on people. Some people get the short end of the stick and just become bogged down. This is good and bad but I've noticed that the focus is to look busy rather than be productive. So while engineers are definitely busy, I don't know if we are producing quality products. \r\nMiddle management. Most are not leaders and seem not to have knowledge on project management. Seems everyone passes the buck to avoid getting in trouble. \r\nLack of socialization. People here do not openly socialize. Not many team building exercises, events, or even lunches. People keep their heads down. \r\nDefinition of \"Agile\" is code for paperwork."}], [{"review_title": "Ok.

If you value having work/life balance, then stay away from Thales.\r\n\r\nThales will work you to the bone because management is unable to manage workload and expectations. \r\n\r\nManagement has no focus, strategy, vision, goals or ability to execute therefore everyone is spread so thin there is never any critical mass of resources gathered to accomplish anything. \r\n\r\nThere is no team culture or collaboration, just pissed off people taking their stress and resentment out on each other. No cloud based collaboration tools - emailing powerpoints back and forth is considered peak efficiency.\r\n\r\nArchaic processes, technology and most people there are dinosaurs stuck in their ways. No investment in digital transformation (Do NOT let their slick marketing fool you). \r\n\r\nYou will waste so much time and energy daily with their outdated IT. My laptop, VPN, email, skype, two factor authentication, intranet, etc. were things I battled with daily in order to do my job. \r\n\r\nDeadlines and expectations are unrealistic, and stress runs rampant. Thales is a perfect example of a culture of \"punished for competence\". If you are able to produce, you will be loaded with more and more work until you are forced to leave to protect your sanity. \r\n\r\nUnless you are desperate for a paycheck (no shame in that by the way), then absolutely stay away.
