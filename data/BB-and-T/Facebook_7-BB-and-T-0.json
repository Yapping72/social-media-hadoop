The \"upper management\" within the state is so far removed from the branch, they do not understand the daily demands. It is CLEAR that BB&T thinks \"everyone is replaceable\" and in that is simply not the case. I have seen some AMAZING, high-producing co-workers leave. The mistreatment of employees is so rough, that clients are starting to notice. They are leaving in droves. It is also not just the \"front-line\" associates who are unhappy.

With the aid of technology (e.g., mobile banking), consumers do not have the need to come into the branches as much; however the goals remain extremely high - almost unachievable.  Tactics used to reach your individual goals is questionable at best.\n\nThe retail branch is run by Branch Bankers (formerly known as Relationship Bankers).  Your Market Leader (Branch Manager) is focused on loans and building the business pipeline.  However,  in most branches your Market Leader will say it's up to the Branch Banker to ensure they have Planed Purposeful Call (PPCs) on their calendar. So, in essence you have to build your individual pipeline as well as your Market Leader pipeline. \n\nBB&T provides wonderful sales tools (e.g., Hoovers), but in most cases it will not turn into sale opportunities.  They also provide you internal list, but nothing to promising comes from the leads.\n\nYour best bet of survival at this bank is to go into an ideal branch where everyone works together (this includes Market Leaders), work at a busy branch, or adopt some questionable sales tactics. \n\nIn sum, if you're seeking a Branch Banker position,  you have to have your sales game on par. They [BB&T] will tell you they are here for the consumer,  but really it what's in it for them.  If you are about building a meaningful relationship with your customer-THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU!!\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:  If you don't hit goals, be prepared for the boot.

Your benefits will be good, you will not be expected to work any hours unpaid(if not exempt), and you will be treated like an individual with the ability to make intelligent decisions. In retail banking, this is not necessarily true of many large financial institutions. \r\n-Ample training - I received five weeks training before beginning to see clients and ongoing training after that\r\n- Values - BB&T is a company that actually cares about its clients. The first time I discussed a fee refund with my manager, he literally word for word asked me what I thought \"Was right for the client and right for the bank\". BB&T is a for profit business focused on shareholder returns, but from executive leadership on down BB&T believes that    its focus in the market is helping its clients to be successful. You won't have to deal with shady consumer finance practices like retroactive interest, hidden fees, or the other sort of crazy stuff some other financial institutions do. BB&T's product offerings, while not always the cheapest, are not meant to be abusive or deceptive.\r\n- Room for growth - BB&T is large and diverse with many different areas(retail banking, commercial lending, insurance services, private banking, etc) to grow into. Starting your career at BB&T provides lots of opportunities to grow both upward and to transition laterally if you realize a better fit exists", "cons": "- Market Environment - BB&T is working hard to cut costs to provide competitive returns to its shareholders. This means staffing is lighter than most associates are used to and the bank has been repeatedly reorganized to promote efficiency. This is hard on the associates, but hopefully will translate to shareholder value and a more relaxed expense focus longer term\r\n- Large Institution - I still happy bank with BB&T after leaving, and am exceedingly happy. However, while a larger financial institution has more width and depth of services, it is still not a small bank. Even with a customer service focus, there is less local decision making than at a small local bank with only a few dozen branches. \r\n- Conservative - BB&T is conservative, and very risk averse. While BB&T is currently extremely well positioned in its retail lending from a competitive standpoint, there will be deals you run into where we cannot lend because BB&T is simply to risk averse. Similarly, we will not charge prices that are likely to create long term losses on other services/products to generate short term revenue. This is great for the overall company, but may make it hard to compete with other banks willing to be more risky and short sighted."}, {"review_title": "Branch Banker IV", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Branch Banker IV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-401(k), 6% matching\r\n\r\n-Great health/dental benefits\r\n\r\n-Base Salary (If you're a top performer)\r\n\r\n-Majority of the in branch staff are awesome people to work with\r\n\r\n-Great Opportunity to get your foot in the door in the financial industry, and get sales experience", "cons": "-Staffing is atrocious, many days were spent with myself closing with one teller, while handling lobby clients, clients on the platform side, as well as two drive-thru lanes in a branch that has very heavy foot traffic\r\n\r\n-Constantly having to deal with AOO's breathing down your neck giving you audit exceptions or giving you a hard time for not have part of a log or sheet of paper filled out with the right wording that they feel is fit.

They will also change goals, strategy, and focus about every two weeks, which makes it nearly impossible to every see a strategy all the way through.\r\n\r\n-They constantly preach doing what is best for the client, this is not true at all. They're a big bank folks, they're here to make money. Those who get promoted are the ones that sell the most products and bring in the most revenue, once I realized this it made my job a lot easier and allowed me to perform better. Get them to sign on the dotted line, then on to the next one, once you can no longer sell them products they are no longer of use to you.

I myself was fired halfway through my pregnancy, a few short months before I could take maternity leave, because a corporate investigator dug up some old private conversations I had with another employee about our personal opinions and disagreements with the company.

The scrutiny of this benefit depends on your manager.\r\n\r\nThey have a generous 6% 401k match, but it must be invested in a BB&T fund.

Those are window dressing terms.  Modern psychologists would call the culture \"a fear-based culture\".  You must always fear and respect management, and always deliver good news or you fear being reprimanded for being a problem. \r\n\r\nBB&T does not pay market, and has great difficulty responding to market data or salary negotiations.  When I was hired, there was little salary or vacation negotiation.  I have heard that new candidates have tried to negotiate offers, and the offers were revoked.  It would depend on which division you work in and how enlightened your manager is.\r\n\r\nMany people are under-worked, so to the fill the time they spend a lot of time gossiping or surfing the internet.  Employees band together in very tight cliques.  This has lessened in recent years, but this is an environment where people will exhibit coldness and other bullying behavior until you are \"accepted\" into their group.\r\n\r\nThe standard vacation package is 10 days a year, and they require that you take 5 of those days consecutively.  You are terminated if you fail to do so.\r\n\r\nThe health insurance benefit has decreased remarkably in past years.  I have not participated in the program since it was so poor, but as of 2009, I believe the best health plan requires a $1000 deductible.\r\n\r\nThey have no concept of \"ergonomics\".  If you need a new chair, you need to bring your own.\r\n\r\nSome managers are actually very abusive to their employees.  My manager regularly screamed at me.  Another high profile manager in one of the IT divisions yells at employees and calls them \"f*cking idiots!\" to their face.\r\n\r\nManagement claims you have \"flex time\", but they make note of when you come and go.\r\n\r\nWorking from home is frowned upon, and discouraged.\r\n\r\nYour coworkers are generally very fake and shallow.  They act friendly to your face to extract information that they report back to management.  They probably view it as a survival mechanism.\r\n\r\nTraining is virtually non-existent, unless you are one of management's pets.\r\n\r\nEmployees are not informed of promotional opportunities or positions.  Management \"pets\" are \"groomed\" and \"selected\" for the position way in advance.\r\n\r\nDress in the IT divisions is business casual, although you never see any other bank customers.\r\n\r\nYou must update your voicemail daily to say you are in the office.\r\n\r\nYou must always wear a badge and a silly nametag, and attend training on the \"Perfect Client Experience\".\r\n\r\nAfter working at BB&T for several years, your skill set will become so out-of-date that will have trouble finding a job anywhere other than Blue Cross and Blue Shield."}, {"review_title": "Pros & Cons of Working on the Retail side of BB&T", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Apr 2010", "job_title": "Relationship Banker in Virginia Beach, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great bank, good hours, federal holidays off, good employee benefits, opportunity for growth.", "cons": "Short staffing, causing every role at the branch level to handle multiple duties without increased pay, not able to take days off when you would like due to staffing, working your birthday if coverage is not available, lack of promotions in certain areas."}], [{"review_title": "Hit and miss, depends on who is your manager and higher up.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Jan 2015", "job_title": "Teller in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent pay, every holidays off, and easy job.", "cons": "Favoritism.

I am not one to give up easily because I put my heart and soul into my job. The beginning of the end for me was when I received an email from my Regional Manager regarding a \"call night\" that I volunteered for my branch because we were behind on our credit card goals. When I sent in the results of those calls to my Regional Manager, I received an email back in capital letters with many exclamation marks stating the results were completely unacceptable.  He stated that if I and my team and make \"x\" amount of calls we should have made \"X\" amount of contacts that should have resulted in \"X\" amount of sales.  So now I have to control  who answers the phone at night or is even home!  Unbelievable! He said nothing about appreciating our efforts and that we were doing all we could (and then some) to try to reach our goals.  This is the type of unappreciative management that BB&T has. In my area, employees are leaving in droves because of the direction BB&T is going with the bank.  What happened to this bank? What happened to Kelly King?  Over the years, one of the things that I heard over and over when something unethical would happen is \"that is not the BB&T way\".  Well, the BB&T way now is this - employees are just a number, they don't care about their employees at all and they don't care about their customers either.  Because if any of you reading this are customers of BB&T, the only thing they want from you is a \"sale\".  And if the employee waiting on you doesn't produce one, they will be looking for another job.

Also, someone who has no idea what they are doing will be promoted ahead as your Team Lead beause their cousin works at the bank :)\r\n\r\n2. Robotic. The more robotic you are, the better. This department expects you to not spend time networking around people who are 3+ years ahead of you, but rather, you should be at your desk 24/7 adding to the production line. \r\n\r\n3. sCraps. This division gives you no foods, drinks, or any HR-coordinated events. Instead, they will give you more work and expect you to smile and ask for you. If you ask why we don't network or have more than a half day for community service, the answer is production! Even if the que is at 0 for the department of 100+ people, they will make you stay at work and want you to \"act busy\" for no reason. Makes no sense to me.\r\n\r\n4. Failed leadership. This company preaches about leadership but you'll notice there isn't a single leader here. You probably won't respect your team leads after several months because (1) you know more than they do and (2) you get tired of being treated as a child. Your team leads will also remind you that they are \"watching you\" constantly, like children. Leadership is not promoted on merit but promoted on politics. You'll notice that you have a better quality and production than your peers but one of them will be selected ahead of you, not because of your attitude, but because they spent more time brown-nosing around. You'll notice the average team lead doesn't meet the department's requirements of production and quality but you'll notice they are promoted because of family and friends. Promoted based off networks, which they make sure you do not have a chance to network around! \r\n\r\n5. Budget. The imaginary budget. Management will always talk about how we have no budget but you'll notice that they take weekly team-lead lunches that are all paid for, includes appetizers, main course and desert. No wonder we have no budget. Then when it comes to promotions in a department of 120+, we don't have enough budget to recognize our associates? And don't get caught replacing the printer paper, you may realize we don't have a budget!!!***\r\n\r\n6. Lies. During the interview BB&T will say your here for 10-18 months, flat out LIE. Our top analysts are stuck here 2-3 years because the bank will not allow you to apply to more than 2 jobs at a time. Ridiculous, I know. And then you probably won't get these jobs because someone else who knew someone else got the job you were applying for. I've applied for 8 positions, declined on all because someone else knew somebody. And I thought attitude, production, and holding 100% Quality was important?  sCrap!\r\n\r\n7.

The Management is in a clique at which they do as much as they can to demote and kill morale in the department so they can to avoid promotions or raises for any of the employees in the department. The department is highly Micro Managed which is the big downfall of the job. It has caused a HIGH turnover rate which seems to make management very happy. In the past few years they have not replaced any of the many that have left and just added extra overtime and more work to save the department money which many feel that the site may eventually be closed due to many departments in the building being shut down. Morale is very low and every employee does minimal to get by. In this position a employee can NOT work independently without a supervisor breathing down their backs which has caused a large portion of the department to go on FMLA for bogus medical excuses to get through the agony of the job at which they can show up to work whenever they want. When hired in the position I was told that 6 months are evening shifts and 6 months are day shifts. Which was a complete LIE. Overtime is mandatory each week so when working the so called day shift it then becomes evening shift as well. And mandatory to stay late each evening. Many employees complain that they are being worked to death and yet management could care less. In this department if you give advice on how to improve the job or help productivity you are shunned upon as for they are always right and you are wrong. There is also no room for advancement in the department and when applying for a another department all requests are always denied. I personally have worked here for a few years and am considered a top performer and only receive a 1% raise each year with no promotions or any hope for advancement and always being shot down for any advancement in the company.

Spend all your time on this mandatory or you get yelled at conference call or webex or in person meeting yet run your team, meet with businesses, and hit your numbers. Do the job of fifty people because some scheduling system says you aren't that busy. Mystery shops have to be perfect yet the shoppers outright lie and the company takes their word over provable notes to show otherwise.  Changing goals every month or don't tell you what you have to sell to keep your job until the new year is well under way and then change them again in a few months anyhow and then again after that. Technology is so far behind. Days to process mobile deposits. Still batch scanning teller work instead of live scanning it. Segmentation and lending limit changes up then down then back up again but you've already handed over a bulk of those higher accounts because your limits dropped sorry too late go create new opportunities that other banks selling all the same stuff already are hitting them up for at much lower rates or fees. Oh the fees for everything. Logs oh the logs. Don't forget to log it. Which log the paper logs a plenty. The account service logs for contacts. The check in sheets for logs. Log log log log log log log. Spend more time logging than you do anything else. If systems were more intuitive or not old DOS blue screens half the logs could auto generate and would not be necessary. Log it initial here, sign there, did you email this person to tell them you logged it? Micro manage you out the wazoo. Have the SSL covering so many branches that they can't even meet with and spend time coaching Market Leaders once a month because they have more direct reports than there are business days in the month. So that means the people who talk a good game can just talk talk talk but not do do do as long as they have a good producing location they have to do zero work. No upward mobility. They eliminate positions left and right so no confidence in stability or job security even if you do a good job and are a top producer. Annual vs. Quarterly or monthly incentives like most other banks. Cheap out and tell the branches not to even order lollipops for the kids or dog bones for the pups. Set timers on our lights and heat controls to be corporate managed that they can't trust us to have our own heat set for our own comforts or to turn off a light like we are two year olds. It's a game of how much can people take before they break but we'll talk a good game of culture and expect our employees to live it but what we throw at our employees we as a company don't drink our own mandated koolaid. Pretty sure they named their position Cluster Market Leader because it is a Cluster but different second word. Same salary to run two, three, four, or even FIVE branches with all different goals and just one you. Sure get a team lead that is a glorified platform and that's all the help you need right? You can hit all those goals and coach everyone and be everywhere right? Oh you can't, oh well, figure it out because you're really not branch managers but business relationship managers so that day to day of the branch you can forget time to do it and focus all on business sales sales sales.

There were four of us at the start and my first week was great. \n\nAfter my second week a coworker retired, my branch banker team leader was \u201cno longer with the company\u201d, my cluster branch manager \u201cstepped down\u201d.  \n\nI was off in training at another branch for teller mentor training and came back to a hell hole. A branch with no leader and three new people. ( no manager, no team leader, supervisor ) it was horribly confusing and uncomfortable. \n\nALL THE CLIENTS were very rude because we new people are required to ask for IDs obviously. I was out of balance and so were the other newbies.... ( we all had only three days of teller training ) No one was around to help and it was the worst experience. We had one violent \u201cclient\u201d that we had to call the police on. THE POLICE NEVER SHOWED UP. \n\nI was also promised I would not have to work every weekend which turned out to be untrue. I was on the schedule 6 days a week every week. That really mad me angry. \n\nBesides all of that mess at my permanent branch : \n\nWhen I was in training at another branch, I saw how everyone hated their jobs and wanted to leave the company. In fact, one did leave that branch the week I was there. \n\nI was treated terrible by clients because of all the unfair fees BB&T charges. Clients were mean in general. \n\nI was shorted training days for teller mentor training so I had to put my foot down to get back into training bc I was not ready. They tried shortening up my banker mentor training so I could keep working every Saturday. I had to put my foot down again and say no \u201cI DESERVE FULL TRAINING\u201d!  It\u2019s so important to train employees right especially in this field. I have worked for two other banks that have done such a better job at preparing you. I was set up for failure.
