Appearances are everything and you can plan on 50 hours a week as a minimum if you are lucky enough to join a group that is well-staffed. I was micro-managed (though that will depend on your division) and in looking for a new position, found that in Utah, experience with Goldman Sachs actually HINDERED my job search - significantly. The years I spent here have been worthless to me. Their roles are highly \"specialized\" meaning that you learn nothing about the broader industry and are basically a ticket puncher doing the simplest menial tasks until they figure out a way to automate your role and you are moved to man another conveyor belt. When I asked to work only a 10 hour day ONE day a week for personal reasons, I was repeatedly NOT accommodated. You can completely forget about any medical accommodation for hours, though they won't hesitate to give you a footrest or seat cushion. They may support you in theory, but not in practice. Turnover is very high (they lure you by saying that it's a competitive environment for the brightest minds and that only the best endure - not reality) and I know several people who have chosen to be unemployed rather than continue to work at GS. I worked for Operations for 2 years before moving to the Investment Management Division. Within one year in the Investment Management Division, I got over 25 \"farewell\" emails from people leaving the firm. The firm is lowering it's hiring standards wherever they can and in most of the hiring discussions I witnessed, the only basis for a decision to hire was whether or not the most senior interviewer \"liked\" the person. They are hiring from all different backgrounds and experience (which they explain as \"diversification\") and grade point average do not matter anymore. This is no longer the organization that hires \"the best of the best\". In New York, you are hired if you are from the right family with the right contacts. In Utah, you are hired if they like you.

From business process, to technology, to building amenities everything is poorly designed, dated, and not what you would expect from a company that claims an allegiance with Goldman Sachs.\r\n\r\nThe Compensation - many of the previous posts speaks of poor compensation and bonuses. That is certainly the case for 80-90% of the staff. This is one of the only portions of the business model that does resemble Goldman.

Promotions are more tied to your pedigree within the company, your appearance, or impenetrable favoritism  than the work you have done or your true value to the company. \r\n\r\nDiversity - There is a significant effort to promote their Diversity Network.

After starting it will quickly become apparent that the goal of this program is to hire people into the program that are either from non-target schools or who were for one reason or another not a strong enough candidate to be considered for a position in New York and make them all compete for a few positions in New York after you have \"proven\" that you are capable of performing at a New York level. Your two years of experience will count as only one year of experience in New York (that means it will take you 4 years to become an Associate versus IBD where it take 2 years). You will be held to a higher standard than those that are hired into the New York analyst program as you need to \"prove yourself\" in order to be considered for a New York position.\r\n\r\nManagement will state that the goal of the program is to pay analysts approximately 55% of what they pay them in New York since the cost of living is lower, however virtually all program participants will agree that part of the 45% discount is cost of living related and the other part is just the fact that you are considered a lower valued \"front office\" employee (on a cost of living adjusted basis you are just not getting paid what they do in New York). Even the argument of the discount being cost of living related is contradictory given that analysts that are hired in Houston (where the cost of living is even lower than SLC), get paid the same salary as an analyst in New York.  As virtually all program participants are unhappy and regretful of the situation, you will constantly hear the Analyst Research Training (ART) program management in Salt Lake City and other levels of management say things like \"you just need to trust the system\", \"for you to perform at a New York level, I need you to do XYZ for me\", and \"we are going to have someone from New York speak with program members about making the transition from Salt Lake to New York\". Since it is generally accepted that the exit opportunities to the buy-side or corporate are more or less nonexistent from Salt Lake City (which from personal experience, this is more or less true), the goal of virtually all participants is to \"make it\" to New York. However, transferring to New York is discouraged after so many analyst have transferred to New York and immediately started recruiting for the buy-side.\r\n\r\nSince you are remote and your boss and team members don't have to see you face-to-face on a daily basis you will be treated as a second class citizen and anything you do or say will be automatically assumed incorrect or lacking merit because you were not good enough to be in New York. Doing anything to please the senior analyst and be a \"team player\" is expected, however this is only expected from the junior team members as management is perfectly fine with senior analysts treating junior team members like the second class citizens that they are. Senior analysts know that you have no other options, and that they can expect and demand anything from you regardless of how unreasonable it may be and the Analyst Research Training (ART) program management in Salt Lake City, will do nothing other than agree with them no matter how absurd and ridiculous it may be. There is no right and wrong, there is what a more senior person says and what a more junior person says and the senior person will always win. \r\n\r\nProbably the most challenging aspect of the program is that you are working on a daily basis with other program participants who are extremely jaded and distrusting of the firm. The vast majority of program participants will openly say to each other that they regret signing the offer because they feel they were deceived by the firm and management, and virtually everyone is doing anything and everything they can to leave the program, but most are not successful."}, {"review_title": "One of the best places to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Research Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Intelligent and dedicated colleagues who will go out of their way to accomplish tasks.\r\nVery good personnel and alumni network.\r\nFirm ensures that you have all the required resources to succeed.", "cons": "You are a single cog of a big machine.\r\nToo much bureaucracy and approval process but this is understandable given reputation to defend."}, {"review_title": "Driven, focused and high expectations", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "19 May 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very little dead wood in the system, everyone needs to perform or else get pushed aside.

You'll see plenty of losers, lazy people, those with lesser credentials, and horrible leaders that are not well-liked get promoted.  You can work harder than everyone and never move up due to this.  Most often you will probably have a terrible manager that is not a subject matter expert and doesn't understand what you do because Goldman does not care whether you are a subject matter expert.  Goldman cares only about putting people in management positions that the manager and MDs like.  \r\nYou'll see everyone in the office is 20 something.  MDs are usually in their 30s or early 40s.  Age discrimination for sure!   \r\nYou cannot really indicate concern with any problems because the firm utilizes 360 reviews, which means your peers provide your reviews.  if your direct issue is with a peer or a manager, reporting bad behavior such as poor work ethic will only hurt those that are doing the right thing.  Employees that do want change and need to report behavior will not for the sake of their career because of this awful system."}, {"review_title": "Like a top Univesity, you work hard but you learn a lot.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 May 2009", "job_title": "Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wonderful learning experience and great benefits", "cons": "Not easy to remain there for a long time.
