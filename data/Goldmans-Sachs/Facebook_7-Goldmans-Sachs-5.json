roles\r\n-Opens doors if you are in the right role, specifically on a revenue generating desk or within a role that involves some sort of technical skills.\r\n- If you are starting with the firm as an analyst or associate, the firm will ensure that you are well trained and treated somewhat decently. There has been too much bad PR surrounding the abuse of analysts recently for HCM to allow anything otherwise. This is especially true if you are female. \r\n-Talks at GS: you get to attend lectures from some very impressive politicians, celebrities, sports stars, business leaders, authors etc.", "cons": "-It's all about the name. You will be paid less as an analyst, associate or VP for the privilege of working at GS. The discount is real!\r\n-The collegiate nature which the firm was once known for no longer exists. Its every man for himself now.\r\n-The best outcome for clients is often not the focus anymore. The focus is often now just how can GS convince clients to give it money.\r\n-It's too \"top heavy\". There are multiple heads of every division, group and desk which puts a massive strain on pay and often makes it difficult to discern what direction management wants you to go in.\r\n-The hours aren't really worth the pay anymore.\r\n-The hours are long as advertised and the competition is fierce, making it next to impossible to stand out.\r\n-Your commercial contributions don't matter at the end of the day, only your manager's opinion of you matters. If you are liked by your manager, you will see decent bonuses and salary increases. If your manager doesn't like you, you'll be fired when they cut 10% of people each year.\r\n-Even if you are performing well, all management really cares about is the bottom line so they will happily outsource your role to India or replace you with an algorithm if possible.\r\n-Political correctness run amok. The leadership clearly supports a certain political agenda, let's call it \"New York liberal elitism\" and if you disagree and share the beliefs of maybe a Bernie Sanders or Trump you will be an outcast.\r\n- If the revenue your desk is generating is consistent shrinking, it will be an all out bloodbath. Partners will blame MD who will blame VPs who will blame associates and analysts. Pay will be cut at every level in order to ensure that the Partners and MDs maintain their level of pay.\r\n-VPs are so busy that they do not have time to teach junior analysts or associates.\r\n-Politics which would put Congress to shame. It's all about who you know. Many colleagues who are friendly to your face and may even give you a good 360 review will say unflattering things about you behind closed doors. The culture is very gossipy and can be backstabbing.\r\n-The company has no strategic direction. It's simply a bunch of people running around trying to cater to every whim of their boss.\r\n-COVID-19: Senior leadership is on the record in the press saying that they would not lay people off in 2020 but they went ahead and laid people off anyway. They lied!\r\n- Positive reviews: most are from very junior people who worked for the firm for less than 2 or 3 years and got a great exit opportunity or have never worked for a normal company.

You are literally a slave to your work, including Saturdays and Sundays. Don't think there is such thing as a break here. There is absolutely no personal space, management is extremely micro in regards to people management, they lack diversity and decision making, specifically the CEO who is all about public image and making sure his Instagram shows the outside one thing when the inside is a Jail. In short, a bunch of white older people with no sense of compassion, people skills or regard for human life. Just about a week, two Vice Presidents who recently came back from their maternity and paternity leave were fired. Even though Goldman Stated there WOULD BE NOT layoffs for 2020. Bunch of lies, just like every manager here. \r\n\r\nLong story short, you may be better off working at McDonalds.
