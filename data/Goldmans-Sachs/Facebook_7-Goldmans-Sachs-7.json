Here are a few reasons why : \r\n\r\nStandards are slipping. In the past 5 years, many jobs such as DBAs and SAs have been off-shored to India to save money. Turnover in these locations is high and the quality of the staff is often lacking. lt's rare to find anyone in these roles who is skilled and takes a genuine interest in what they're doing.\r\n\r\nThe amount of regulation and red tape has reached absurd levels. A simple task such as getting a server rebooted becomes a bureaucratic nightmare, involving multiple levels of manager approval followed by repeated emails, phone calls and hours of waiting. Don't even think about downloading a cool piece of productivity software onto your PC. You'll first need to check whether the app has been approved for use at GS, then get your manager to sign off, and finally open a ticket to have it installed remotely. If your app isn't on the approved list, forget it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, India is never, ever referred to as a \"low cost\" location at GS - it's \"high value\", to use the correct GS-speak, To survive in the corporate hierarchy, you'll also need to learn how to \"reach out\" to somebody (= talk to them), to \"revert\" to an email (= reply), and how to \"leverage\" virtually any object (= use it), I know GS doesn't have a monopoly on this sort of double-speak, but I always find it faintly worrying to see how otherwise intelligent people parrot these tired phrases without a hint of irony or self awareness.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most-used buzzword in recent years is \"industrialization\" - as in replacing human jobs with software, Management claim that industrialization will free people from routine or boring jobs, allowing them to spend time in more creative activities (there's never been an attempt to automate any MD- or partner-level jobs, although those are probably the most amenable - wonder why ??) \r\n\r\nIt's difficult to criticize GS for wanting to cut costs, but it's dispiriting to think that your job in IT is essentially to put other people out of a job. Earlier in my career, GS was about using harnessing human intelligence to solve complicated business problems (and being paid well, because we were doing something that few others firms could). Increasingly we seem to be engaged in a race to the bottom, chasing ever-shrinking margins with as few overheads as possible, The relentless drive for efficiency makes for a pretty unappealing work environment - desks have been \"densified\" (another lovely GS-ism), office plants have been removed, and even the waste baskets have vanished. \r\n\r\nDon't expect to be be particularly well paid. I guarantee that you will quickly become fed up of reading about the \"average\" GS bonus payout in the media, and then having to explain to friends and family that you're only paid a fraction of that amount. I used to be proud of the fact that I worked as GS, now I try to avoid mentioning the name,\r\n\r\nThe annual 360 reviews can also be pretty dispiriting. Over the years I've had reviews across the scale. Doing well seems largely to be a question of being in the right role and knowing the right people. Don't fall for the rhetoric about meritocracy - working hard and doing a good job is no guarantee of success. Personally i'd far rather the whole system were junked - I've had to deliver a few bad reviews in my time, and it's unpleasant and often utterly demotivating for the recipient.\r\n\r\nOh, and prepare for endless cheerleading about the benefits of diversity and multiculturalism. The training is mandatory, so no sense complaining. But the sad reality is that \"diversity in the workplace\" often translates into hiring candidates who simply wouldn't have made it through the door 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nI loved my early years at GS, but I would not be tempted to re-join the firm today."}, {"review_title": "More like Goldman Sucks.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Associate in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Hmm.. uhh. hmm.. nopes doesn't ring a bell.

Every report should be accurate and concise, every email professional in tone and content, every analysis has every angle covered with good presentation and the appropriate content for the audience.  Everything matters and you better be sure your work is up to grade.  Don't be scared they will understand you are new to this the first few times you make a mistake.\r\n\r\n- Smart people all around you\r\nIf you haven't realized it by now you will shortly that you are rarely the smartest person in the room (if you are currently that will change at GS).  These people are smart.  Very smart.  You can pull the wool over their eyes once or twice or maybe get by for awhile with a manager that doesn't care but in the long run (year or longer) you will be exposed.  Thats ok, you don't always have to be the smartest in the room you just can't take it personal every time someone calls you out in public or private and get better.  Again, this is Ops not other divisions.  Ops is not out to call you out every time you make a mistake or criticize you on every idea.  They do it its because the firm benefits more when your mediocre idea is vetted with other smart people and becomes a great proposal.  Don't take it personal. \r\n\r\n- High stress environment \r\nThis is a pro and a con.  If you can handle a high stress environment you will thrive.  If you can't you will learn to or you will be looking for a new job shortly after joining.  GS puts a lot of pressure on you really quick.  Like I said before, what you do matters and sometimes you have to make really hard decisions in short periods of time because market is closing or client is threatening a walk or your manager doesn't want to lose his or her head and needs you to crunch some numbers yesterday.  Just know that once you overcome these obstacles you will be better for it.\r\n\r\n- Responsibility is high for junior individuals\r\nAnother pro and con.  Almost the same speech from high stress environment.  \r\n\r\n- Mentors\r\nRest assured the really good managers at GS (and they exist) understand that good junior analysts need good mentors to show them the ropes and take them under their wing.  GS will even match you up with one if you haven't found one on your own.  Just know that its on you to follow up with them and if you are smart you will have more than one and they will be strategically placed in positions that you can leverage.  Reach out to them, gain their insight and heed their advice because they have been there longer than you and guess what they are still there and successful so they must know what they are talking about.  Just don't restrict yourself to one, get many and get them from backgrounds that you are not comfortable with.  More perspectives will often change your own on a situation.  Take this advice; man walks in a desert when he surrounds himself with people that think and act like him.", "cons": "- Work/Life balance\r\nForget it, you won't have one.  You work 10 hour days on a good day and 15+ on a bad day.  Your dog will drown in anxiety or chew up your sneaker collection, your wife will hate your job, your kids will wonder if you love them and your friends will inevitably people that work with you or in the same industry.  Assuming of course you are on the path to success at the firm.  Otherwise you may be able to pull off weekend getaways, the occasional afterwork drink and hey maybe even the gym to burn off all those donuts you ate your desk.\r\n\r\n- High stress environment\r\nRead above but if you can't handle being in a stressful, high strung, alpha environment where everything you do matters than please save yourself the therapy sessions and medical costs and try something else.\r\n\r\n- The actual work can be boring\r\nYeah it sucks, especially at the analyst level.  Guess what? Processing transactions, data entry, project testing, trade settlement, account opening, etc all suck. They are not fun.  Not even a little.  But it gets better... you know when you are an Associate and you are leading a team of analysts doing something they hate for that almighty dollar.\r\n\r\n- Corporate politics\r\nThis is not unique to GS.  For those that are in college are have never worked at a large organization please mentally prepare yourself for the office politics.  They are there and you are playing whether you like it or not.  You can choose not to play and hope by the good graces of Allah and Blankfein that you are noticed for your good work but I have a higher chance of getting that 10 at the gym to ask me out on date.  You are going to have to play.  Marathon some Suits on USA and learn up on office politics and keep yourself out of the crosshairs as much as you can.  Build friendships and network, don't through people under the bus, and don't take credit for someone else's work and you will be fine.  This is where a mentor will do you well.\r\n\r\n- Compensation\r\nAnalyst level it sucks and you will kick yourself for it.  Stick it out and get lucky that the firm has a great year and you too can have a great year.  Just remember its based on how well the firm did, how well your business unit did, and how well you did.  Oh and you are also in ops which is at the end of the day a cost and not a revenue generating arm of the firm and so you will never get rich until you make MD.  Well off at VP but not rich.\r\n\r\n- Senior Leadership\r\nHow can I say this.  Just because Michael Jordan was arguably the best player ever... doesn't mean he is a great coach.  Phil Jackson was a mediocre player and well look what he accomplished.  GS traditionally promotes Jordan's to management so prepare yourself. \r\n\r\n- Accountability\r\nYou should definitely have this.  Some people won't and some people will.  Sadly you will find there are large groups in GS Ops that are not.  You can't change them and unfortunately those that don't are what slows down good businesses.  Be accountable and you will be surprised on how fortunate that will be for you.  Heck, be accountable for other people, it shows leadership and managers will recognize that.\r\n\r\n- Can't trade (oddly a big downer)\r\nGS Ops cannot trade on personal accounts.  Well you can but only if you first check with your manager, the compliance lists and your mom.  Sadly almost every company is on some list that restricts you from trading.  Get used to indexes and big funds.  Its like working for Sam Adams and company policy says you cant drink... ever without asking them first.\r\n\r\n- Grindhouse mentality for some areas\r\nThere are areas of GS Ops that are quite literally grindhouses.  They take you in, chew you up, and then spit you out when you are done.  Then they go out and get the next college kid and repeat.  Sorry its just how it is.  Learn what you can and transfer to another area if you want or leave but its their business model and it works for management."}, {"review_title": "Great place that I would go back to", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Analyst (Trading) in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing learning opportunities, attractive pay and bonus, great work ethic and culture, diverse and international environment, needless to mention the company reputation (and what it does to your CV), ....", "cons": "Working hours are often over-rated, most is face time and it's just useless!\r\n\r\nAlso I got an offer for a job, and when I started was placed in a totally different team where we had ZERO personal fit, my boss hated me and the role was not at all what I wanted to do.

Welcome to Goldman Sachs ..\r\n   The firms line that it is a meritocracy, is nonsense. We have good performers and people with excellent leadership potential languishing as analysts, while their peers who have a good rapport with the foreign  managers will already be Vice Presidents. In short \"apple polishing\" pays out here.\r\nHave you heard of a situation where a 23 graduate who has been trained by a 28 post graduate, ends up becoming his boss (with much higher salary of course) only because the firm is desperate to attract fresh graduates to do their no talent work. Once again, welcome to Goldman Sachs. \r\nIn short if the management or the foreign dudes like you, your career + money + bonus are assured.\r\n-TOO MANY PHIRANGS - The firm does not trust the work done by the Indians, which is why they send Foreigners to Bangalore by the planeload. Abroad these people are mere graduates with negligible work ex, but here they become Senior Management, who stay in high end service apartments and five star hotels with unlimited vacation time.\r\n- NO HIGHEND WORK EVER COMING TO INDIA - The firm is nothing but a receptacle for the low end jobs that the guys out there do not want to do. When the same job is being done abroad, the work will be so low end that it will be something that an intern from college will do for the first week in order to keep in busy. Once it comes to India, it becomes hyped up, made out as if its critical with performance metrics etc but the fact is the work is still something that a 15 year old kid can probably do without much trouble. \r\n- DISCRIMINATION - Welcome to Goldman Sachs - Nothing is ever fair here. I am not talking about that between Indians and foreigners.  This is discrimination between you and the fellow sitting in the next cubicle. For eg, You are a performer with excellent rating who will be slogging for years without a promotion but the fellow (mediocre chap who cannot even type an e mail properly)  next to you will flying abroad every month, enjoy huge bonuses etc only because someone in the management likes him. You will suffering coming in the office cab, while this guy will driving in with the latest highend car bought with a quarter of his bonus.\r\n\r\nIn short,  this is a good place to work if you are a fresh graduate recruited from campus, but if you are a lateral hire joining from some other company, please think four times before you join. The company will only treat you like a fool and not offer you the growth that you hoped for when you left your old firm. Please do not get taken in by the compensation. Its a trick.

Over that span of time its culture has remained remarkably strong and enduring.  Indeed, although there have clearly been ups and downs along the way, all the primary reasons for starting and building a career at GS remain just as relevant today as they have been for years.  Namely:\r\n\r\n1. Strong culture of teamwork and collaboration.  People help each other out.  There is a significant focus on helping people succeed, and on nurturing and developing talent. This, in turn, drives some important aspects of the interviewing and hiring process.   Conceit is the enemy of collaboration.  If you are too convinced of the veracity of your own point of view, you will tend to undermine he team-oriented environment and the objective of getting to the best outcome on any given issue or decision. Therefore, a healthy measure of humility, balanced with a proper level of self-assurance, are key traits for successful candidates.\r\n\r\n2. Training and Professional Development.  GS has a very extensive range of formal training offerings, although in this regard it does not differ materially from other large, leading organizations.  The more important element - and the one that will tend to play a much more relevant role in your career advancement - is the wider culture of coaching, mentorship and apprenticeship that exists in the firm.  It is a central element of the way GS works that people take an interest in teaching and developing those beneath them,  or even in other areas to whom they have only tangential connections.  While there are formal mentoring programs for summer interns and new permanent hires, the more enduring mentoring relationship are the ones that grow informally - and GS is very fertile ground for this.  Although the firm is now over 30,000 people, it retains the feel and intimacy of a much smaller firm.\r\n\r\n3. Long term career platform.  I've worked in multiple divisions and regions with the firm.  Most managers' initial instincts are to fill open roles with talent already under the firm's roof.  Generally speaking,hiring is on such a scale that there is plenty of need to hire new people from outside the firm. However, the central point is that as an employee, you have access to a very wide variety of opportunities within GS and most people who've been at the firm for any length of time have typically been in a number of different roles or have moved around geographically.  Does it work perfectly? No - but an unusual effort is made at all times to get the right people into the right seats.  \r\n\r\n4. Working with the best.  There really are some remarkable people at GS.  In many cases, people you work with are the most renowned at what they do in the world.  It will take your game to a new level.  I've worked personally with hundreds of GS people over time, in all kinds of functions and all kinds of places.  Contrary to popular external perception, the people are friendly and the atmosphere collegial.  While remarkably talented, people are also remarkably normal.  The kinds of people you would be pleased to have a beer with.", "cons": "The firm is generally very thinly staffed.  When it works well, it provides for a rich and intense experience, rapid learning, great advancement in exposure and responsibility, and fewer people among whom to carve up the spoils. Rapid career advancement is more possible here than at many other places for this same reason.

Wide-spread acceptance of this as the standard operating procedure.  If people complain (and one needs to be careful to whom you complain), the typical response is something along the lines of \"this is Goldman Sachs.\"\r\n- That said, there are some very, very talented software engineers at GS (including and especially the CTO, who is on the board of the Java programming language).  But broadly speaking Ops Technology is not a very talented group.  Many of the very talented people are leaving, making things worse.\r\n- The way layoffs are handled is very much without integrity.  When I first started with every person who was let go -- either fired or laid off for some reason -- there was an announcement and an explanation.  In 2011 there were so many rounds of layoffs (at least 3 major ones, and several smaller ones) management simply acted like nothing happened.  You might be in the middle of a project with somebody and send them an email only to get what we've jokingly started calling \"The Layoff Autoreply\" -- their mailbox is \"full\".  Invariably mailbox full meant it'd been disabled and the person was laid off.  No word from management.  Just an empty desk and bounced emails.  Asking a manager for details about so-and-so would only get a \"yes\" or \"no\" to the question of whether they still worked at the firm--no details, explanation, etc. so lower and middle management had clearly been instructed not to discuss in any detail.  So it ends up just ominous chatter and gossip about who is the most recent person to be laid off.  One can imagine what this does for morale...\r\n- Steady trickle of technology jobs -- not just support roles, but real software engineering -- out of NYC to Salt Lake City or Bangalore.  They're euphemistically called \"high value locations\" in GS lingo.\r\n- Production support at night and on weekends is very widespread.  It can easily ruin a weekend.  This is fine, but coupled with the machismo \"This is Goldman Sachs\" mentality, it means there's no comp time and frequently not even a \"thanks\" for sacrificing the weekend.\r\n- A culture that encourages distractions.  Focusing on one thing for an extended period is very, very difficult.  The cubefarm is very loud -- you need noise cancelling headphones if you're easily distracted by loud chatter or phone calls nearby.\r\n- Dated technology is very common.  I came to GS a few years ago expecting it to be a cutting edge place, but discovered my group had just switched to Java 5--in 2009!\r\n- Budget cuts are brutal.  There's no more travel.  No more firm sponsored happy hours.  No Blackberries unless absolutely necessary.  There are zero perks now.\r\n- There is currently (first / second quarter 2012) an exodus from Technology at GS -- the talented people are leaving for startups, tech firms, or hedge funds.

Ayco employees can be found in the Goldman Sachs internal employee directory, and a lot of you're employment paperwork is on GS letterhead, so I guess they're technically GS employees.  \r\n\r\n-  Can be a great experience, but it all depends on who's team you're placed on.  If you work under a VP who's understanding and compassionate about the well-being of others, then you'll have an okay time and might even enjoy yourself.  I'd say I had a good time.\r\n\r\n-  Ultimately, wealth management is a sales job (depends on person if a pro or con).  If you make it to VP, be prepared to be a salesman.  However, you're pretty much handed rich clients, rather than cold-calling, so that's one thing really good about Ayco.  The hard part is making it to VP.  If the business is there, then you'll be rolling in the dough as a VP (but probably traveling and working a lot as well).", "cons": "-  If placed on a team with a \"grinding\" VP, be prepared to hate your life.  You'll literally get called on holidays and asked to come into the office.  An analyst in my office was called into work on Mother's Day while he was out with his family, and he was an hour and a half away from the office.  Also, if you plan on moving up to the VP level, you're expected to come in before your superiors and leave after your superiors (which is understandable, especially in a \"face-time\" focused industry like finance).  You're also expected to say \"yes\" to anything asked of you, including the anecdote mentioned above.  Office politics is heavy; there's a lot of brown-nosing and kissing up.  However, office politics is probably true of any work environment, especially finance;  so everyone on Glassdoor complaining about how the politics suck at Ayco should stop complaining and grow up.  Social politics is a part of life. \r\n\r\n-  For a wealth management firm, Ayco places an unreasonable amount of time into the tax planning and tax return preparation of clients.  If you're in the Financial Counseling division, I'd say that 75% of the work you do is tax related.  The job is not as investment heavy as it is played out to be.  As an analyst right out of undergrad (no CPA or any prior tax experience), you'll be preparing ultra complex tax returns for clients that involve multi-state sourcing of stock options and restricted stock grants, foreign income and foreign tax credits, etc.  In addition, a good number of associates in the \"tax department\" do not even have a CPA, nor do the VPs.  Pretty much, you'll be doing CPA level work for cheap.  I don't understand why Ayco places so much emphasis on taxes; I don't believe it adds much value to the bottom line of the firm.  If the wealth management divisions of Bulge Bracket Banks (Goldman Sachs [the REAL one], UBS, Morgan Stanley) are thriving with major AUM, have healthy profit margins, and aren't focusing on preparing tax returns, I do not buy the argument that Ayco makes that doing taxes \"keeps us closer to our clients.\"  Instead of spending so much time and emphasis on taxes, Ayco can spend more time on bringing in new business and AUM.  I'm open to other arguments.\r\n\r\n-  The pay is extremely low for the amount of work you're expected to do.  You'll pretty much work Wall Street hours for 1/5th of the Wall Street analyst pay, and you won't have the exit opportunities that they have.\r\n\r\n-  Morale is extremely low.  Every analyst who isn't trying to make VP (I'd say about 80% aren't trying to make VP) is pretty much fed up after 1 year and start looking for a new job.  However, it's frustrating because wealth management skills don't really transfer to any other industry besides wealth management.  I'd say the low morale is a result of the low pay, corporate culture, and lack of employee perks compared to other companies (I hear of a lot of places that serve free lunch everyday and give every other Friday off).\r\n\r\n-  SORRY FOR ANY GRAMMATICAL/SPELLING ERRORS.

Plan on spending a lot of time doing technical support and learning a lot of code that is not well-documented.  Plan on fixing bugs and doing a lot of \"uplift\" work.

Management doesn't appear to be doing much about it.  Their new strategy seems to be to drive their senior engineers out of the organization and replace them with younger, low-cost engineers that they can work to death and hold a work visa over their heads.\r\n\r\nGoldman hasn't had a really good year income-wise, since 2009.  When you are interviewing, they will sell the \"bonus\" as a significant part of your total compensation.   But, the bonus is directly related to the firms earnings for the year and less related to the great work you did that year.  You could be a super hero engineer one year, but if the firm did badly that year, plan on a small bonus.  On the other hand, you could have a less than stellar year with the firm performing well, and get a good bonus.  My experience was that I got a good bonus a couple of years and a less-than-inspiring bonus on the other years.\r\n\r\nThey talk a good talk about work-life balance, making you believe that is part of the corporate culture.  Don't believe it.  Once you get to the VP level and above, you will need to sell your soul to GS to continue to move up the corporate ladder.   If you don't care about having a life outside of work and your family is a low priority, you will do very well at GS.  Also be sure that you have very good skills playing \"corporate games\" and politics as you move up the ladder.  Those skills become very important.  If you are a good smoozer, you will do well.  If not, plan on being treated badly enough that you will choose to leave on your own.\r\n\r\nGoldman rarely fires people.  Their strategy is to level off your salary and stop paying you bonuses, until you leave on your own.  It's a lot cleaner that way.  No lawsuits to worry about for wrongful firing.   GS is always looking to \"manage risk\", even when it comes to their people.\r\n\r\nFinally, the most important thing.  Make sure you have a great relationshsip with your direct manager.  GS does a \"360 degree review\", but 350 of those degrees are the opinion of your direct manager.  Even if 15 of your peers think you are a superstar, you will not got a good ranking, if your direct manager thinks you are lacking.   By the way, a poor ranking against your peers translates into getting passed over for a bonus.\r\n\r\nSummary -  Join GS right out of college, work 4 or 5 years, get trained, get some experience, get GS on your resume and get out.

Well, first things first, I worked in one department of one of the many divisions of GS. GS is a company of well over 30,000 employees. Each division is like a company in and of itself, so generalising an experience even within a single division is fraught with issues, so you'll have to take my words in that very narrow context.\r\n\r\nThe Good\r\nProbably the best thing about this company is that it is very pro-diversity. They want to create a work environment that mirrors the real world on the outside and they are keen to tap the brain power of the diversity that's out there. While I don't particularly care to know at work what someone gets up to in their own downtime, it's likely to be reassuring to others who are LGBT or of other diverse backgrounds who are looking to their own futures within the firm. To reinforce the firm commitment, it is mandatory for employees to complete a minimum of 2 hours annual diversity training.\r\n\r\nI'd say that every person I met at GS was top notch. There are no village idiots or jokers lurking anywhere. Professionalism is at the core of being a successful employee. I always got the feeling I was rubbing shoulders with the 'A' grade crowd...the Ivy Leaguers. Almost everyone is uber smart and hyper keen. If you have an issue and you need someones help, then most people (though not all) you talk to will make it their mission to help you out.\r\n\r\nThe corporate gym is very well equipped. Great machines, great classes to attend and cheap membership gives you an Rebok-like experience at about half the price. It's a bit weird the first few times you go as GS optionally lends you a gray t-shirt, gray shorts and white socks to sweat you stuff in so no need for you to bring in your smelly sweats to the office (but you will need your own training shoes as thankfully they are not provided). Membership includes your own private locker but I never used mine as I'd never want to leave anything sweaty in a locker overnight! Since everyone uses GS sweats, this culminates in a complete lack of gym clothing diversity...it's a sea of gray and you feel like platoon infantryman as you wander round the gym floor.", "cons": "The Bad\r\nWork-life balance. Depending on the division you work in will have a great bearing on how hard you will be expected to work. Miraculously the department of the division I was in is somewhat chilled out compared to all other parts of the firm I heard about. Most of my colleagues were averaging about 45 hours per week. That's almost unheard of in GS most colleagues in different divisions were putting down 16 hour days every day as a norm.\r\n\r\nWhen you exit the building at 6.30pm of an evening on your way home, you will pass a swarm of busy bees carrying bags of takeaway food re-entering the building on their way back to their desks for another 4 or 5 hours of work. These are the eager beavers and the company rewards this kind of hard work when bonus season comes round in February. If you're not one of these people, then chances are your career is unlikely to reach the stars to say the least. A 55 hour week is at the very bottom end of the \u201chard work\u201d spectrum. Read the Forbes article about Liz Beshel to see what the commitment level for success really is at GS if you plan to go beyond the stratosphere at GS.\r\n\r\nThe Ugly\r\nAlmost every big corporate company shares the same \"hard work\" traits, but GS effortlessly manages to up the ante to another level:\r\n1) You are always available even when you're on vacation because of the Blackberry phone\r\n\r\nYou are always just a phone call or an email away from being brought into help solve the latest problem no matter what hour of the day is or what plans you made with your family this weekend. \r\n\r\nLogging in from home in the weekday evenings and on weekends like everyone else does is a basic norm at GS\r\n\r\nNot responding to a weekend crisis due to a trip away with the family is something to avoid. The company expects performers to be available at all times\r\n\r\n2) When you join the firm you will spend one day going through 'orientation', effectively being indoctrinated in all things GS. During this day, you will learn (among other things) about the strength of the GS 'posting culture'. They tell you that everyone posts constantly and it is expected that you will post constantly as well.  \r\n\r\nDue to the \"posting\" culture at GS, your inbox will quickly overflow every single workday so mastery of Outlook will go some way towards managing it, but in reality, most folk put in additional evening work hours to get on top of it all. The signal to noise ratio is generally appalling from middle management upwards.\r\n\r\n3) As if email traffic wasn't a bad enough problem to manage, they have recently added 2 more mountains for the GS information worker to scale, neither of which are inter-connected. \r\n\r\ni. First up, GSConnect is the internal social network \u2013 think Facebook meets LinkedIn meets Goldman Sachs (It's built on top of the popular Jive social platform). This is a reputation (points) based platform for everyone to hear about what everyone else is up to in the firm and chime in with comments, articles, advice and tips. \r\n\r\nFor many folk at GS, this is a great means for marketing ones own skills within the firm. Being seen to continually contribute to the team and the firm will get you noticed. But like any social platform it is a double edged sword that could easily destroy ones reputation in a heartbeat. Not being seen to actively contribute will come back to haunt the employee at review time and therefore at bonus time.\r\n\r\nii. Second up, LiveCurrent is the new instant chat program that you will need to be seen participating in. This is a place to share information in a more immediate manner with the GS hive. It's nothing more than chat rooms. LiveCurrent is a basic annoyance as pop up toast interrupts the working day continuously with banal updates from various leaders\r\n\r\n4)  GS meetings are primarily all about asking questions. If you want to succeed at GS, you need to practice this art to perfection. Unfortunately most meetings are a waste of time but there is no throttle to control them other than to decline them, but not seen to be participating will come at a price during the annual review process. Most meetings result in more noise be it email trail, GSConnect or LiveCurrent - trying to stay on top of the noise is challenging to say the least.\r\n\r\n5) Consensus driven culture. The orientation day will inform you that there is no such thing as a 'star' performer at GS because everyone operates in a team and therefore the team is the 'star'. Not only that, but you will now have to get used to \u201cbuilding consensus\u201d on a very regular basis. You will get praise for being seen to round up the herd and get buy in from everyone for decisions of any magnitude and that is the problem. Typically (outside of GS), most people naturally seek consensus when there are big decisions, but GS has promoted consensus building to a first class citizen within the firm so even small decisions get quickly bogged down with the basic requirement to build consensus. \r\n \r\n6) The 360 degree annual review. This is a 2 month gruelling process imposed on everyone at GS that is taken very seriously by all. It is essential to have mended all fences with your colleagues at least 2 months before the review process starts or suffer the the wrath of their short term memory. The official word from management is that the review process does not affect your bonus which is very hard to believe.\r\n\r\n7) Unofficially, GS has currently different levels that are **due to be disbanded**. The levels are as follows: Analyst, L1, L2, L3, M1, M2, Partner. If you are being hired currently, be sure to ask the level you are being hired in at because they won't tell you unless you ask and it will take you a month or so after being hired before you find out and this information and by then it will be too late to change it (you will have to wait for the annual promotions for which you have to be nominated first). To give you an idea, L2 is someone with 5 years experience. Levels are not advertised internally at all, so you will have no idea what level other people are at unless you have the conversation. Being hired in at the right level will influence the compensation bracket you fall into, so it's reasonably critical to know - you want to come in at a level that truly reflects your skills and abilities. A key point to make here is that the levels are due to be disbanded very soon (or it may already have taken place since I am an ex-employee). It's worth mentioning that VP (Vice President) is merely a badge of honor at GS, not a level as just discussed. Therefore, it is of no consequence to your compensation, so bartering for VP with HR is nowhere near as important as bartering for level since only the latter will have any impact on your compensation profile. So now you know.\r\n\r\n8) With no one knowing what level anyone else is at, you won't be surprised to hear that GS has no org-chart. So you will have no idea who reports in to who. This can be very confusing and the idea is to reduce structure in a bid to allow ideas to easily bubble up. If you are used to a classical hierarchy where you report into one boss who defines what is required of you then beware as it doesn't work like that at GS.\r\n\r\nWhen you add up the time spent processing the ever flowing fountain of information you will soon notice that you have no time to do the job you were actually hired for unless you plan on working evenings because only then can you actually get some work done once the crescendo of information dies down for a few precious hours. Stealing your way into work by 7.30am will also buy useful time before the noise starts up again.\r\n\r\nWith the banking sector having effectively destroyed itself from its own deregulated excesses of the 2000 era, it's worth noting that remuneration packages were substantially reduced as a result. It's fair to say that most employees will not climb any higher than middle management (L2 is the defacto level at GS) and it's only after middle management that game changing compensation starts to kick in. Assuming you were to get to that point, consider carefully the time that will need to be sacrificed in your life (especially family life) and weigh up the pros and cons. If you get an offer from GS then that itself tells you something useful: you are by definition a high calibre individual since very few candidates get an offer from GS. With that in mind, why not consider channeling your highly rated skill-set (and GS are excellent at gauging skill-sets) into joining a fun start-up (GS is not a fun place to work by the way)? Or if you have a ground breaking idea, why not do you own startup?"}, {"review_title": "Pretty much what you'd expect", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Summer Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They let even the interns get working immediately so you gets lots of hangs on experience, even if it is with Slang.

Well in Ops, you're the one on the other end of the phone when said wolf picks up the phone to scream about a failing trade. It's purely extractive and exploitative.

Security. Great Benefits", "cons": "There's many branches within Goldman.  So I can not speak to them all as the company is massive.  However for the division I work in I see a few issues. One being that management talks behind the backs of the employees.  Also that if someone is not doing well in the division, it's openly known on the floor. I've had one co-worker who had really no business knowing another co-workers standing talking to me about \"His numbers\" and how poorly he does, and basically what a looser he is.  If this was one isolated incidents it would be one thing, but it just isn't. I've had this come up in meetings with my manager where he discussed the standing of someone and though didn't give an name, gave descriptors that made if fairly clear who he was talking about. I've also noticed that thought they do attempt to coach and help these people, they also treat them like they are total morons, talking just a bit more slowly, or explaining things just a bit more than necessary.  This sometimes coming from manager who have only had this and one other job in the two or three years they've actually been old enough to work....  Manager I'm thinking of is 22. It's only his second job. No education past High School talking to an older man with a bachelors and 40 years work experience under his belt.  Speaking of age, I have also noticed within our division, no one over a certain age gets promoted. There is a huge age gap in regards to who's moving up and who's not.  This I find highly disturbing in that it appears to be clear age discrimination. Though the job is secure, they will not fire anyone for the most part. In all likelihood to avoid unemployment penalties. However they will keep people around bumping down their pay and putting them through Hell trying to push them out.  On the surface it's a friendly upbeat environment. Under the surface though it's very very dysfunctional edging on abusive.  One last thing to note..... the company is VERY conscious of it's image. They are big on \"Reputational Risk.\"  In working here you are told you are forbidden to act in any way politically, like any protests, volunteering with certain groups, etc.  So be sure you are willing to trade your civil and constitutional rights fr a pay check.  It's to the point that one person who wanted to volunteer with the opera of all things was told she had to get permission from a review board before she could even look at it.

You will be better off to start your career elsewhere and with any pay raises will make much more than a financial planner/analyst here in almost any other professional environment after a few years. \r\nMy personal experience is promotion without any increase in pay, bonus or COLA adjustment year after year. This is not out of the ordinary. Now think of that, truly, doing a good enough job to be promoted without anything but a title change. Does that happen anywhere else? Expected to work long hours, help pick up work load from others overworked with zero gratitude from management. Moral is extremely low and has changed dramatically over the 5+ years of working there. You will be told if you give up 5 to 10 years of your life you can make account manager which is the only job worth having in financial counseling. The AM job is very high paying and if you make it there would be happy with your choice to work there, but really have to compete for it and being a good employee/worker is not all that is needed.  This is a very political company, while this is true to an extent in any business, AYCO is extreme here. Above all else, your career progresses by working for and being liked by the right people as long as you are a decent employee. You need to work for the right people that care about getting you promoted or have a voice with senior management or you have virtually no shot of moving up in any capacity and that is outside of your control. There is very little transparency in bonuses, pay, etc. Worked at an office that broke new company records for new AUM in a year and no year end bonuses were given out because \"Goldman\" did not have a great year. This is not atypical, as every year now it seems bonuses, raises, cut expenses etc. will not be given out because of something to do with Goldman Sachs in one way or another. Not sure if this is just the go to excuse or real, but again, very little transparency . Overall, there are a lot of good people to work for or with, it just seems that the company is becoming less and less of what it used to be. Even if you work for a good boss that cares and appreciates your work, that means little as ultimately senior management or the Goldman office makes decisions. Moral continues to decline. This is too bad, because when I started here it was not the case. It seems that the more involved Goldman becomes the more the work environment deteriorates. It may be worth a shot for a few years to see if you can make it and get a name on a resume and training which will open some doors in finding another job. But from my experience, and knowing others that left, you will quickly find that you are overworked and underpaid once you go elsewhere and will really appreciate your new employer."}, {"review_title": "Operations Analyst", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Analyst in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A little over a year at GS and I am very surprised.

There is a deep deep foundation of inequality between men and women. Women are hired more often for certain roles rather than others, and not surprisingly those roles top out at VP rather than Managing Director or Partner like the roles that are more often held by men. Last year on national women's day (or a comparable made up holiday), we got an email from the executive office stating that they recognized the disparity between men and women at the firm, and in an effort to remedy that, they would be endeavoring to hire 50/50 men vs. women in the incoming analyst class...... This hollow attempt at a solution just floored me. It felt like throwing a limp soggy bandaid on a gaping wound. The problem isn't that you aren't hiring enough female analysts at the bottom of the ladder--the problem is that you aren't enabling women to stay in the workforce and move UP the ladder. Better yet, you aren't holding men to the same standards that you hold for women who seek the same promotions.\r\n\r\nFor example, a good friend of mine spent ten years at the firm. She had multiple credentials behind her name, had recently gotten her MBA, and spoke up about wanting to make the switch to a separate position with more responsibility and room for upward mobility (also a role overwhelming held by men). Management told her that they were instead going to give her a different role that they'd just created--something sort of halfway between what she'd been doing already and what she wanted to do. Simultaneously, there was a guy who had been hired at the firm straight out of college, who'd been there two years and had no advance degrees but walked around with his chest puffed out, and management decided that he WOULD be a good fit for the same role that my friend was trying to get into. For what it's worth, this wasn't something that they were just hiring one person for but rather they were accumulating many candidates to train for the program all at once, so there was definitely room for the both of them at the onset. My friend kept fighting and finally she was given the okay to go into the program, but they'd managed to ruin the whole thing for her in the process. She ended up making the decision to leave the firm and is much better off now... But it was certainly an eye opening experience for me. If you're a woman, expect to work ten times as hard for the same opportunities.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, and this is particularly timely given the recent cultural awareness provided by #metoo, if you're a woman, you can expect to get touched inappropriately by men that you work with. It's literally just something that you get used to. I'd be talking to my friends in other industries about this one guy who always puts his hand on my lower back or the other one that would rub my shoulders, and they'd be SHOCKED. Another dude would always find a way to get close to me at office happy hours and find some way to touch me. Meanwhile I was just used to laughing it off! Another time, a male supervisor reprimanded me for \"not bothering to put on some earrings\" before a client meeting. Mind you I was wearing makeup, a tailored Armani skirt suit, low Louboutin heels, and had done my hair, but that wasn't put together enough for him! He was wearing.... a suit. My work friends and I would all share stories over drinks, but we all knew that nothing was going to be done about it. Management was already aware, but the primary offenders were the rich white dudes that kept their business afloat (in their eyes), so there was no touching them (pun intended). \r\n\r\nHow about another one... After my first year, I had exceedingly positive feedback in my 360 Feedback (the word \"allstar\" was used multiple times by multiple aforementioned important white men) and yet I got a 3% raise. A male peer had been hired a week after me in the same role, had made multiple mistakes that cost the firm money, and got a 6% raise (yes, we discussed these things). His bonus from the firm was also twice what I got. A year later the same guy was fired after he CONTINUED to make mistakes, and I was promoted to a different title but again only got a 3% raise. For anyone who is want to say that women make less because they don't negotiate, I can promise you I fought tooth and nail for a higher raise, and was given a YOU'RE WELCOME with my measly 3%. \r\n\r\nIf you're pretty and you're smart, you won't have any trouble making friends, but you WILL have a hard time getting ahead.

Whatever Goldman Sachs asks of you, it will never be too much. I find it interesting that no one complained out loud; taking abuse without complaint was part of the culture.\r\n- Technologies used are very old. Updating them won't happen anytime soon. \r\n- The firm has very little interest in increasing developers' technology/programming skills. You will sometimes feel more like a business analyst than a programmer.\r\n- Developers have to spend a ridiculous amount of time in meetings. Most of these you will call into, since most attendees will be in other locations. Much of the time you will have nothing to say and will learn nothing from the meetings.\r\n- Email volume is huge. I spent tons of time reading emails (not just automated alerts, etc. but actual emails written by humans).\r\n- Most development teams are split geographically, often with some team members in India. Projects are often divided among developers in India and the U.S., and it's easy to imagine how that would be counterproductive. You only get an hour or two of overlap first thing in the morning where you can discuss project issues with India. Sometimes those India team members call you when they arrive in the morning, India time, for updates - this means late at night calls for you.\r\n- Everyone is expected to be in the office by 7:00 am or 7:30 at the latest, and those arriving late are sometimes told off.\r\n- Just because you arrive at work early every day, don't expect to leave early. Quitting time is 4:30 or 5:00, and that's if you're not working late.\r\n- Every project, every email, every issue is SUPER urgent. This means developers are constantly being pressured to get software released, and routinely need to stay late in order to get things done. The quality of the software suffers as a result.\r\n- When there is a software release, a developer from each team (whether his team is releasing anything or not) has to stay in the office until the release is done and they can verify their teams' software is working correctly. This can be until after 9:00 pm. And don't think you can come in late that morning; you will probably still be expected to arrive at 7:00 am.\r\n- The global nature of the firm makes worldwide meetings a pain for Salt Lake folks. These meetings are sometimes scheduled at 6:00 or 6:30 am, and you will be required to attend.\r\n- Evening and weekend work is a regular thing for many teams. If you are asked to work on a holiday, it's likely you won't get a comp day to make up for it.\r\n- Frequent after-hours phone calls from Production Control for a variety of reasons (nearly always false alarms) - you get these calls regardless of whether you are actually on call.\r\n- Work is not very interesting. The way things work at Goldman, even very small software enhancements can require lots of coordination between many teams, and months' worth of work.\r\n- Most teams' software is mainly written in stored procedures, not Java or some other \"real\" programming language.\r\n- What Java code they do have is badly written. I think this is partly because the developers are used to writing stored procedures.\r\n- Everyone bows down and worships higher-level management when they come visit. I always found this funny. Once we were asked to clean up our desk areas in anticipation of somebody's visit.\r\n- Work environment is really bad. Lots of people crammed into very large rooms.\r\n- You can't check your personal email at work. This is due to SEC regulations, I believe, but it's a pain.\r\n- There is a lot of big talk about bonuses during the interview process, but for me and others I talked to, we were unimpressed by our bonuses.\r\n- Everything requires lots of approvals. Sometimes things get delayed because management didn't bother to approve."}], [{"review_title": "Challenging and interesting", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 May 2012", "job_title": " in City of London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working in a highly professional environment with talented prople from all over the world.

Most other employees at Ayco hate their jobs, so you will have friends to wallow with in your sorrow.", "cons": "Ayco has the most miserable, toxic work environment that I have experienced in my professional career. You will be worked to death so that, if by the grace of the gods, you will become the almighty account manager. You will be judged completely by how many hours your put in and not by the actual quality of your work. Be expected to work from 8 am - 8 pm Monday - Friday, as well as come in one day per weekend. 90% of the employees sit around complaining about how much they hate their job. They openly state that they are actively seeking other jobs.\r\n\r\nRaises? Bonuses? Not a chance. You are lucky to receive a $500 salary increase, even with a promotion. Bonuses generally range from $0 - 2,000. Ayco itself can have a fantastic monetary year, but salary and bonuses are completely dictated by Goldman Sachs. Ayco loves to blame not giving bonuses and salary increases on Goldman having a bad fourth quarter. Don't worry about the Goldman executives - Ayco services them as clients and they make millions every year, even when Goldman has a \"bad\" year. Upper level management will continuously lie to you to get you to work harder, only have to your hopes and dreams crushed shattered at the end of the year.\r\n\r\nDid I mention tax season? You get to do your full time job in addition to preparing a boat load of complex tax returns. Tax season breaks people because it so painfully miserable full of archaic processes and procedures.\r\n\r\n\"Technology.\" Saying that Ayco has \"technology\" is offensive to the word. My computer in 1995 had a faster operating system. Ayco uses thousands of programs rather than one integrated system, such as a company like Merrill Lynch. Your computer will constantly crash and you get used to seeing \"Not Responding\" multiple times throughout the day. Management loves to talk about making process more \"effecient\" but they refuse to invest in modern technology.\r\n\r\nCompliance. Ayco likes to make things as difficult as possible for the employee from a compliance perspective. Minor things like changing a client's email address or phone number is a major chore.\r\n\r\nThe holy grail aka Account Manager role. The account manager position is what everyone at Ayco strives to be. This is the position that generates all of the money and respect. If you are not on a career path to become account manager, then you might as well go ahead and find a new company to work for. Everyone knows that account managers make good money, but management loves to keep their little payment formula a secret. Let me enlighten you roughly on their compensation structure:\r\n\r\nAccount managers make 1/3 of the counseling fee that Ayco charges clients. Ayco's counseling fee averages to be about $10,000 per client. If an account manager has 60 clients, then they are generating about $600,000. This makes them about $200,000.\r\n\r\nNext, Ayco's fees for assets under management depend upon the investment strategy. On average, account managers receive a $2,000 raise per every $1,000,000 in a managed strategy. If an advisor has $100,000,000 under management, then this will generate approximately $200,000 of income for the account manager.\r\n\r\nLastly, account managers receive a percentage of premium for any life insurance, LTC, annuities, etc. that they sell. It's not usual huge numbers but can add up to another $25 - 50,000  for an average account manager.\r\n\r\nWhile the account manager role can be financially rewarding, it is a position that requires an immense amount of work and day trip travelling 2-3 days a week. It is grueling and pretty much kills your chance at spending any time with family. Ayco advisors are required to have a minimum of 4 meetings with clients per year, compared to most investment advisors who meet 1 - 2 times per year. Tax season also puts more stress on the advisors. Many of them burn out and move onto other companies, even if it means taking a pay decrease. The wealthiest clients are always tied up among a few advisors at every Ayco office. Literally there may be 3 advisors at an office that make as much as 12 other advisors combined. Management plays favorites with certain advisors and hands them the best of the best clients.\r\n\r\nThis list could go on forever. Please do yourself a favor and take a job elsewhere. I don't want any more people to have to experience the depression that Ayco causes its employees. Ayco will forever be Goldman Sachs' ugly step child."}, {"review_title": "Decent place to work", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Associate in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Talented and Hard working people who will help each other to get the task done.\r\nNice bonus at year end", "cons": "Everything like promotion, compensation has to be said out loud to be taken care of.\r\nNot that great for people who want to grow technically."}], [{"review_title": "Long Term Rewards", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Dec 2019", "job_title": "Financial Planner in Deerfield, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great clients and business development model, strongest wealth management firm and backing of Goldman research and investment products, knowledge employees", "cons": "Extremely demanding work environment and old technology makes everything more difficult than it needs to be, located in a distant suburb, poor commitment to a diverse workplace, hands off management, takes a long time to begin seeing real compensation"}, {"review_title": "Neutral-Positive:", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Sept 2008", "job_title": "Senior Analyst Developer in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good balance of work and home when the going's good - relaxed environment, respectable in just about every way.

Lateral hires are the underclass at GS and face hurdles at many points until they exit and truly hope this offers a window to some who my be deciding on options of joining or leaving GS.\r\n\r\nFirst, please note that as a \u201cLateral Hire\u201d you are called a risk to GS as you do not carry the CULT ture of GS.  This will not be known in your welcome package but you will realize this a few months later.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Work Principles\r\n\r\n1.  Never take a stand on anything.  Follow the tenured GS folks who will never take a stand as they know that winds can flow in all directions.  It\u2019s better to stand and watch as your convictions are withered away but all is well with your career path. Be always in the hedge mode.\r\n\r\n2. Appear to be as detail oriented and technical as possible.  Focus on the detail on page 8 of a presentation and highlight a certain unknown regulation or regulatory aspect. You are always technical.  Just simply a technical person who clearly loves the details! I was simply bothered that no body worried about the clause at the end of page 11 that has profound implications for the program trading business!  Yes you now have their attention now back it up with what you have to say. Say it fast as if the train is ready to leave the station. Then state we should discuss this tomorrow when we can get some time! You now have the attention of some senior folks in the next 24 hours.  Bad news travels fast at GS.\r\n\r\n3.  Use words and lingo such as \u201cremit\u201d \u201copportunity set\u201d \u201cmandate\u201d with the right frequency and with cautious pragmatism. Use the word \u201cpost\u201d instead of \u201ctold\u201d or \u201csaid\u201d.  I posted him not told him or her.\r\n4. Be prepared with your story of rags to riches.  This is the favourite topic of partners of how their humble beginnings now seem a distant past considering current status, wealth, position and self-acclaimed respect in society.\r\n\r\n5. Proclaim how naive you were before you joined the oasis of wisdom. Proclaim that your wisdom now stands corrected. Your life truly began only when you joined this oasis otherwise it was merely your imagination.  Yes this is the corporate version of the Benny Hill show.\r\n\r\n6. Never speak about what you learned before you joined GS, it\u2019s simply not applicable.  It was already known and has been factored in. Just as you never talk about your old pagan religion in front of Benny Hill.\r\n\r\n7. Remember that people are human capital that can be positioned. You can go \u201clong\u201d or \u201cshort\u201d on people as with trades.  They are just a different form of trade. Every year people are traded like cattle graded using quartiles. \r\nQ1 - Cult centric smart folks who will trade in all their values at the altar of GS.  They have few things they will stand for. Quite malleable in opinions as long as it meets their career goals. They can get away with almost anything. Many Q1s are truly smart but not all Q 1s.  Some Q1s are there because of political winds such as diversity (a potential story for GS 4 years from today as to how GS made their life from rags to riches albeit all social disadvantages example a widow, a refugee from Syria, may be an LGBT who escaped persecution in their home country etc)\r\nQ2 - Want to be more Q 1 like but not quite there. They are supported politically.\r\nQ3 - Smart people that work hard but not quite visible as they are the ones in boiler room powering the firm and not in front of the press\r\nQ4 - Smart lateral hires who have not found political support from the Cult as yet. They were leaders in prior organisations and have made a difference elsewhere but are not GS ready. They have opinions and may think independently and offer them unknowingly as they have yet to realize that there is a discount factor applied to any and all they have to offer and say.\r\nQ5 - Essentially Q4s who have never been coached or supported. Political underclass who have not tasted the flavour of the quarter or year.\r\n\r\n8.  In the US we always hear it\u2019s not what you know but who you know that matters. Although loudly proclaimed as not being the case at GS.  GS is really the epitome of that statement. GS would widely proclaim that face time does not matter. However, Face time is selectively offered to Q 1 s without the rest of Quartiles knowing about it and believing that face time does not matter.\r\n\r\n9. There are few true friends here. There are acquaintances. A few people will stand up for what\u2019s right even when the winds blow strongly at them.  They have usually left to join other organisations. They become friends when they leave GS.\r\n\r\n10. You are told that GS should be the top 3 priorities in your life. Family or your partner being one of the three.  Please refer to Principle 7.  You are never quartiled in your family so GS cannot even be close to your Family as a priority.\r\n11.  Please do not manage people well. The worse you are with people the more technical you are as you really have no time to focus on your soft skills. You are headed to be the next Co-Head of a Division. Remember capital stays and can live to be long term greedy; people die eventually after they pass on capital and know-how of how to build capital (this is also known as succession planning or \u201ctake out planning \u201c\r\n\r\n12. Women, complete a major project in the last trimester and then head out on maternity leave. You can come back two years later as part of the return ship program. Men you cannot compete in this arena. Even if you complete a similar project and take leave to take care of an ailing parent you have no chance of return ship as this is not the flavor of the decade.\r\n\r\n13. How do you know all is well with your career. You do not. You never know where you stand as the winds can blow in any direction. Once this uncertainty is part of your DNA it will ensure you try harder like the honey bee that is trying to predict the wind direction. \r\n\r\n14. Culture Careers; Expat Therapy-  Become an Expat;this is the best career move you can make.  Move to another country and make sure you claim that this is some serious stress for you and family. State how you had to use bottled water to brush your teeth to protect yourself and family while the commoners in the vicinity had to travel to collect drinking water from nearby sources. It does not matter what others do you are truly the expat that matters. You will be airlifted to safety albeit after your promotion for the stress you took for safe drinking water. Make sure you make some noise about local practices such as the caste system in India, lack of public transportation. If you are an expat in the US, you cannot talk about how African Americans are still not safe at police hands or that American schools are unsafe for your children just as you had felt the need for bottled water to brush your teeth you will not find the \u201cbottled water version\u201d of American schools.\r\nCulture Careers\r\nIn the first month of your expat assignment offer some deep insights on the country and the firm in that country.  For example, in India confirm what others have proclaimed previously in the first month of assignment. The place is hierarchical and respects you more than you deserve and therefore your co-head even more than he deserves (she here is inappropriate as that would mean that India is not sexist).  People will not escalate problems beyond their Manager as it goes against culture norms. This statement would generally help you in extending your assignment as you have still not careered sorry carried the culture of GS to the locals. In addition, this statement may help you continue having oversight for India from NY or London or elsewhere. Quickly talk about how your Housemaid was courteous to you and family beyond your expectations in arrogant NY. Explain the help you offered the maids son in Math and learning computer skills. If you have pictures preferably in local attire as this could be in the next global newsletter. (Very Trudeau!)\r\n\r\nOnce you train the locals to escalate make sure they escalate to you and not to your boss as that could mean they are not yet fully GS cultured. \r\n\r\nIn your going away speech, proclaim how yoga and India have changed you significantly. (especially till you reach your Tribeca apartment and you order your Decaf Latte at Starbucks that is priced more than the daily wage of you courteous maid who continues to rant to neighbors about your computer lessons to her son)\r\n\r\nIn your flight back to NY think about the careers besides yours that you have helped make, especially that person in the corner who you did not connect with as they just kept doing their job well (Q3) and did not socialize or escalate anything to you. He is doing well and has left GS for a start up analytics firm working on AI."}, {"review_title": "Incredible place to work with really driven and smart people.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Jun 2020", "job_title": "IBD Generalist Analyst in Ciudad de Mexico", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Exposure to several industries and products\nSteep learning curve\nAnything is possible kind of culture\nMotivated senior team that create a domino effect to  junior team\nFast paced work environment", "cons": "Long hours, culture at times can be as if there is nothing else relevant in life other than work\nInformation disconnect between junior and senior team"}], [{"review_title": "GS...the ideal place to start a Wall Street career", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Jun 2008", "job_title": "Summer Analyst in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opens doors all over Wall Street, work with bright people, potential to make a lot of money, ability to work with the industry's best, strong global name brand on the resume", "cons": "The long hours, pressure, and a tense environment are the downsides; There's also a level of politics even at GS"}, {"review_title": "Best workplace in NYC", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Jun 2009", "job_title": " in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The best thing about GS is that you work surrounded by bright people but unlike in top university where people only care about themselves, you work as a team in GS", "cons": "You need to be good in reading office politics.

They promise the pay but always delay it... keep that carrot dangling in front of you. Personally, I got \"promoted\" twice, with no pay raise with the promise of raises or bonuses but all I received was plenty more responsibility. \nFACT: The company has a compensation issue. What compensation? Exactly. They fail to compensate. They say, for the area, you make very good money and that's how they address the issue. \nFACT: Hard work will get you ahead; I will not deny that. But kissing up to management and being lazy will get you promoted. The management at Ayco does not want to address the real issues. They'd rather speak to everyone as a whole and not do the job of managing people. \nWhat keeps people from leaving Ayco? The camaraderie of your co-workers. The fear that if you leave, you're not going to find something better. They tell you the grass always appears greener on the other side and give you excuses why it appears better at other companies. For all current employees, I'll tell you that's true. But I'll also tell you the grass really is greener on the other side. Sometimes you have to bite the bullet and make the jump! Take a risk.

In the name of flexibility, you have work from office, then home or cab while travelling (many do that). \r\n\r\nIn most of the companies, there are cycles of pressure (more work), then breather before the next release.

I think for many personal life suffers, yet we keep working in hopes of Bonus and salary. \r\n\r\nI feel like a slave honestly, most of the times.
