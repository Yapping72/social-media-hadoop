If you don't learn how to do these things it will take you forever to get promoted. It's a good skill to have and will serve you well in your career. \r\n- Impact - The work you are doing does matter. Even small things, if they go wrong, will have a big impact. Attention to detail is important.\r\n- Learning - Great opportunity to learn about the Financial world. Everything you have to learn at first may seem overwhelming but it is worth it.\r\n- People - Willing to help you out or answer any questions at anytime. Just be honest about needing help with something so no errors happen. At Goldman, it always better to ask for help than make a mistake \r\n- Time Management - Just a lot of things to do everyday.

If you work out of college, just know that you could be earning more at any other job you apply to, even Dominos. The dedication needed for this job is not worth the pay out. It is obvious this company sees younger employees as interchangeable, so its hard to not see them the same. \r\nLimited Growth - After 1-2 years on desk you will have learned most of your job. Roles are very niche. If you have any other skills you want to develop, your role will limit you. \r\nBonus/Salary Increase - While based on performance is fine, scandals impact your bonus a TON. \r\nPrestige - Working at this company gets to peoples' heads. \r\nButton Pushing\r\nPromotions - Take forever. Have to show face and do the most to be up for a promotion. I heard someone say to stand out you should be coming in an hour earlier. Seems to be an outdated mindset. \r\nWFH - Provided no equipment\r\nHours - Work life Balance is difficult"}, {"review_title": "Great company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Associate in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High base salary and bonus", "cons": "Don't give stocks and ctc is low"}, {"review_title": "positive experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Equity Research Associate in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "pay, team, great city, opportunity", "cons": "long hours, difficult work, challenging"}, {"review_title": "Long hours, good work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good learning and a great brand", "cons": "long hours is the biggest con here"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Associate in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work and learn", "cons": "Can improve levels of employees and work hours"}, {"review_title": "Decent place to work at", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Operations Analyst in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company for recent grads", "cons": "GS has a very unorganized onboarding processes"}, {"review_title": "Solid place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good learning experience, really smart employees", "cons": "Large company with associated hierarchy"}], [{"review_title": "Solid company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Forex Trader in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good people and work quality", "cons": "Sometimes Long working hours here"}, {"review_title": "Great Job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Analyst in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Smart people, good pay, decent culture", "cons": "Long hours, sometimes very stressful"}, {"review_title": "Analyst", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Finance Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Long hours, not work life balance", "cons": "Pay is good, benefit is good"}, {"review_title": "Overly Professional Culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Investment Banking Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Smart People around\r\nGood Diversity\r\nLuxury Officespace", "cons": "High Working hours\r\nWork to Work relations only\r\nCulture of IBD has not changed since century."}, {"review_title": "Headline", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Vice President in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strong talent, consensus driven management", "cons": "in many areas, up or out culture may not suit everyone"}, {"review_title": "Good place to start", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Analyst, Global Markets", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.

Also don't take a promotion prior to the beginning part of Q1 (when you know when the raise will take effect).

Mobility into front office has become a bit easier since many people resigned during COVID.", "cons": "Your experience will depend largely on the team that you're placed in, and will vary from very bad to an average, dull job at best. Most managers are worn out from years in this role/industry and you can tell that they're unhappy with their lives. This translates into the role with a culture of under-training, overly high expectations, finger-pointing when there is a mistake, and micromanagement. Teammates are unhelpful and get annoyed when you ask questions, even though there is no other way to learn the job since all of it is very Goldman-specific. They will actively talk about you negatively and assign blame when something goes wrong. Overall, the people make it a very toxic culture. There are a few genuinely good people, but most are only worried about themselves and networking with you so most interactions feel surface-level.\r\n\r\nThe lack of training may be due to the expectation that there will be high turnover, which creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you do stick around and even if your team isn't bad, your job is to do very monotonous, repetitive tasks that would be better off being automated. And, since Goldman uses unique software and your role has such little impact to the company, there's no transferrable skills that you gain for your next role. \r\n\r\nOps is also treated as the bottom of the totem pole here and it shows. My annual bonus was <5% of my counterparts in front office. You get paid a fraction of what the front office makes, with overtime rate at 0.5x (instead of the usual 1.5x). At this point you're working 10+ hours of overtime per week for less than the NYC minimum wage at around $13/hour. \r\n\r\nMy advice: only take this job if you have no other options. Even then, beware that there is a 12-month minimum contract, where you have to pay the (pre-tax) $10,000 relocation bonus back to them.

Time off, benefits, and HI were high quality. Pay is what you would expect for an entry-level financial analyst position after college, but it never goes up with performance or tenure.

They talk about career progressions and promotions constantly but it's all an illusion, as it takes 3-5 years at a minimum to move up a level and your income never changes (except for a 1-3% increase each year) during that time. Even when you get promoted you are still capped out at a 75k/year total compensation (base and bonus) structure (takes many years to get to that cap) in this department. \n\nThis coaching role at Ayco is really just a stepping stone to gather experience to ultimately leave Ayco, since there is no long-term career for a coach at Ayco that is financially feasible. Accordingly, the turnover is ridiculously high, which should tell you everything you need to know. My team had about 15 people in my region when I started and every last one had left Ayco within two years. Even during that two-year time frame, many people joined and left shortly thereafter. The biggest con is the universal, stagnant pay... every coach gets paid the same (within 5k margin) regardless of performance or experience. Some coaches may perform consistently at a 10% rate compared to other high-performing coaches , but get paid the same as the high-performing coach. However, since turnover is so high, they will never get rid of the poor-performing coaches. Therefore, it seems like the culture is a competition to do as little as possible, but just enough to not get fired (which they would never do). Coaches that actually stick around long enough to understand the compensation will gradually transition into doing as little as possible at work while they look for a new job. \n\nManagement and the internal accounting system are extremely antiquated. You can only get promoted at the end of the year and your pay can only change at the beginning of the year. If you are on the verge of promotion and don't get it, then you have to wait a year before being considered again.\n\nInternally, the organic, progressive career path for a coach would lead to the team leader position. The team leader runs a team of coaches. I have heard from prior team leaders that their pay is still very low (capped at 75k maybe). Additionally, there are very few team leaders for the coaches and very little opportunity for a new team leader position to open up. However, when a team leader position opens up, it seems like Ayco will hire some externally to fill the role, instead of the hundred-plus coaches looking for promotion (even though some coaches are very qualified and tenured).\n\nVery little collaboration. You pretty much just take calls and satisfy your appointments all day, every day once you are out of training. There is very little teamwork and plenty of isolation if you don't create opportunities to meet and socialize with your colleagues. \n\nHigh burnout rate from doing the same thing over and over again all day. Nothing ever changes meeting-to-meeting, day-to-day, week-to-week, etc..."}, {"review_title": "Great culture", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Vice President in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good company to work for.

Part of my total compensation for 2020 was an equity component which represented 15% of my total bonus. One needs to be mindful of the fact that at Goldman Sachs, the bonus makes up a significant chunk or one's total compensation. Other financial companies pay higher base salaries than Goldman Sachs so Goldman tries to make up for the difference with a higher bonus.\r\nI had worked for Goldman Sachs before, from 10/2004 through 5/2012. Part of my compensation back then was also paid in RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) which vested over the course of three years. Back then, it was also acknowledged that if I were to leave the company, I would forfeit unvested RSU, unless I was over the age of 50.\r\nThis time around, the rules for equity compensation have changed. The Equity Component was vested immediately, but could not be exercised for a number of years.\r\nInterestingly, when I started investigating this issue in greater detail, I discovered that the last leg of my equity compensation component could not be exercised until 2050. It is most likely that I would not even be alive by then.\r\nIn November 2021, I received a correspondence from GS stating that I needed to certify my equity component. Failure to do so would result in immediate forfeiture. I complied and retained this correspondence for my records. One of the mandatory fields in the certification form was the name of my present employer. I specified my present employer as Bank of America. Note that my current job at Bank of America has absolutely nothing in common to the job I was doing at Goldman Sachs. Bank of America has over 200,000 employees who perform a myriad of activities that are completely unrelated to what other employees may be doing at Goldman Sachs.\r\nOn January 19, 2022, I received a letter from Goldman Sachs stating that all of my RSUs granted as part of my 2020 total compensation package were forfeited because according to RSU agreement paragraph 11(a), it was deemed that I associated with a \u201cCompetitive Enterprise\" after departure from the company.\r\nAnyone who is still working or thinking of joining Goldman Sachs needs to be aware that the only way their Equity Compensation component could be worth anything is if they were to stay at the company for many years."}, {"review_title": "Lot of learning", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Accountant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I learn a lot of new things", "cons": "work life balance sometimes hard"}, {"review_title": "Overrated", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Vice President Technology in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Smart people around\nGood perks\nWell regarded", "cons": "Constant and high workload\nMost tech is old, boring\nMost projects are meaningless (just done for the sake of meeting regulations, quality not important; see recent fines they received because of this) \n360 review a joke - opportunity to backstab colleagues anonymously (and get their bonus)\nLots of old timers, people who joined the company from uni and stayed with the company ever since (10-20 years).
