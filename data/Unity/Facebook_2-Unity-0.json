Management can't admit mistakes that were made, nor take steps (skip level promotions) to fix these, claiming not to want to set precedence. This is not just me being grumpy, nor an isolated occurrence. This is happening to several ICs and only the leadership chain above those affected can't admit it. The miss-leveling and injustices in leveling is acknowledged by fellow team members, other ICs as well as by current and former leads that are outside the reporting structure of the affected, but know them and the work they do.\n\nThe claim is that the leveling system (essentially the same as Mircosoft's) is still too new and that kinks are still being ironed out, but that it is, safe for very minor in-balances, fair and correct. But if several people with over 5-8 YOE at the time are leveled the same as a Student Worker turning FTE, I don't see that as a minor in-balance.\n\nYour experience may differ, depending on how focused you are on your career. If you are working on one of the more highly visible products (read flashy), are good at self-promoting, continuously keep your lead honest to their claims of career growth, or manage to switch teams every odd year or so, you might do fine. \n\nOtherwise, this company can easily become a death-trap for your career, including plunging it into reverse.\n\nMeanwhile, constant reorgs create countless career opportunities for middle management, to the point where that seems to be the only rhyme or reason for them. \n\nTop management meanwhile thinks they can push decisions down the hierarchy instead of listening and letting ideas bubble up.

Unity introduced the idea of Salary bands but then often employees are being promoted outside of the salary band. You're told that employees shouldn't know what the bands are anyway, so it shouldn't matter. Just recently they announced that this would need to stop. It'll be interesting to see if that does happen in the next promotion cycle.\r\n\r\nWorking From Home - Although the business has clearly functioned and done extremely well over the course of the pandemic, they're still adamant that employees should return to the office. There's a process to follow that would enable you to request remote work but it's another problem when it comes to hiring or retaining top talent. There's lots of roles out there now that will pay more (base salary) and offer fully remote to employees and we are loosing out to good talent due to this."}, {"review_title": "Great workplace", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Montreal, QC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Growing, Potential, Chill, Relax, Enovation, Diversity", "cons": "Lack of process, Question mark for leadership sometimes"}, {"review_title": "Some things are quite good, some things are really bad", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Helsinki, Southern Finland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Most of the co-workers are nice and highly skilled\r\n- Compensation is OK\r\n- Nice benefits\r\n- Tech stack is interesting\r\n- Massive scale of data", "cons": "- No career progression if your work is not classified as \"high impact\".

I remember when our mission was still to support small indie devs in bringing their vision to life. That's not the case anymore, it's all aggressive marketing over product quality.\r\n\r\nSince we became a public company, every move internally and externally has been towards less transparency to users and internally and more corporate obstacles like more middle management and a centralized undemocratic environment.\r\n\r\nUnity now makes it mandatory to install spyware and tracking applications on your work machines. Until last year, your machine was your machine and the company treated you like an adult capable of securing a laptop. They tried to roll this out without even notifying people at first, which directly went against our value of transparency.\r\n\r\nDevelopment is in chaos. We have far too many tech streams between the core editor and packages, releases can happen any time and you'll never know if a package released from another team will break the thing you're working on. Communication could be improved by a lot. If we had a vision it would be one thing, but right now we have a few different competing visions and that weaknes us overall.\r\n\r\nResources allocation is another problem for both human resources and teams funding. Critical systems are supported by tiny teams and non essential but flashy systems get most of the monye.\r\n\r\nBut the biggest disappointment to me, as a long time Unity employee, is how the company has started dealing with serious internal issues. Before, if you had a problem with someone, you could talk it out and resolve it and HR would help you mediate if necessary. Now, if something serious happens, like prolonged harrassment or abuse, we have an HR department whose only job is to protect the company and the abuser. Sure they tell you the spiel that they will talk to the abuser and coach him or her on how to be less toxic, but then the toxic behavior doesn't stop and subsequent complaints fall on deaf ears. They even try to discredit you or convince you that the problem lies with you, the complainant, and not with the person whose behavior is actually the problem.

We aniticipate, prioritise, pick up the pieces of work that we decide are most valuable or necessary.\r\n\r\n- Effective PMs: I have been in companies where PMs push feature upon feature without considering team impact, cost, end result and value. Here, our PM is asking all the right questions and is really a bridge with various teams we build our product for. This really makes a big difference in keeping engineers out of long meetings.\r\n\r\n- Work culture is fully scandinavian. You shine through work delivered, not hours at the office.

The management team shined on the pandemic response. Quick communication, open questions and answers, clear tactics, fast delivery of physical support across all offices.\r\n\r\nOver the past year, you can see the effects of a rapid growth on the company. Unity, and especially the management teams, are really aware of the value of the original company culture. It might have changed since its inception (according to conversations with long time employees), but coming from a mega-corp, I saw things that really appealed to me in their approach. I feel more valued and considered as an engineer, and that had a big impact on my daily life.\r\n\r\nThe interview process was very personal.
