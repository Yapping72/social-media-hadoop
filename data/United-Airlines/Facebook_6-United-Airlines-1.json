We can't all be senior management, and we can't all be CEOs in corporations.  I do think they can do a better job at providing equal opportunities to excel.  Reviews are a joke.  Your rank is most likely already known ahead of time, and when they hold \"alignment meetings\" about who should be ranked what within your group, your manager has to be put under duress of their own career when challenged about the score of their employee.  Meaning, if you boss or another senior manager wants their employee to be ranked high and because there is a forced distribution in review ratings and you need to be ranked lower to preserve the forced distribution, if your boss wants to get ahead he/she will fold in light of their own agenda.  Huge complaint internally.  Forced distributions of review rankings are not a new thing, but how it is executed is the difference in making a great process and a process where there is abuse, neglect and corruption.\r\n\r\nAnother example of limiting upward mobility...the manager training program...its only open to new grads from B-school.
