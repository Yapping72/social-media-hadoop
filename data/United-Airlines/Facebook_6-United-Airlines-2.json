Management seems to have actual contempt for it's own employees.  They begin treating you like a five year old the minute you arrive at their training center.  Management will treat you with a complete lack of respect.  My best advice is to avoid the airline industry altogether.  I have a bachelors degree, and after 23 years of employment, I found myself earning about $39,000 a year... but I was flying my ass off.

Morale is low amongst the flight attendants and it isn't  a happy place to work.

You can basically work as much or as little as you like and operations makes it very easy to do through a system of shift trades and voluntary off days. I cannot express how great this is. You can work up to 16 hours per day or take months off. It's amazing for people who are pursuing higher education or have second jobs.\r\n\r\n-The job itself is quite easy. It takes very basic analytical reasoning skills along with an elementary grasp of critical thinking skills and logic. The computer program used in most areas is very basic-anyone who can use the internet with any degree of ability can learn the program fairly quickly. And, if you make mistakes, it can be fixed very easily. \r\n\r\n-You get great discounts on everything from hotels to cellphone service to perfumes to computers.

Even with a college degree you will start off at minimum wage and years later will only be making a few dollars more. Average hourly rate in the city I work in (according to official state website) is $22.55. I make less than half that-and I've been there for a good while. Salary increases are based only on time, not performance. The best performer in the office who brings in the most revenue will make just as much as the person who makes you wonder how they even got hired. You will top out at around $20 and that's after a good 15 years spend at the company. I wish i were exaggerating. I don't know how people raise families on that wage but those are the people working the 16 hour shifts. \r\n\r\n-You have absolutely no hope of advancement. All promotions are based on seniority ONLY. Again, you can be the top performer in the office and the person next to you who files their nails and snaps their gum all day automatically gets promoted before you if they've been there longer. You can't even blame office politics, it's all a numbers game. If someone was hired in a day before you were, they will always get priority over you, no matter how stellar your work is. It only encourages mediocrity. You do the bare minimum to get by because, really, it doesn't behoove you to expend your energy on something that may net nothing more than a certificate and a $5 Starbucks gift card. Going above and beyond is really just altruism.\r\n\r\n-If you have a thin skin or sensitive constitution, don't bother. Although I have rarely had this problem (no more than other other job where one works with the public), I have heard some truly nasty things said to agents by customers. I'm talking gender-specific epithets, racist comments, and just plain ridiculous comments. Sometimes customers don't see you as a real person and they can get really abusive. I don't take it personally but some of my more sensitive coworkers have ran out of the building in tears before. If you can chuckle and shake your head when someone's dropping f-bombs and screaming, you'll be fine. If not, you should probably look elsewhere for work.\r\n\r\n-This is just a personal peeve of mine but the management treats us like they're kindergarten teachers who are afraid of an unruly class. We are so micromanaged to the point where they send supervisors to walk the floor and make sure we aren't eating or on our cellphones or chit chatting with each other instead of working. And, of course, this is all under the guise of \"supportive management.\" If you treat your staff like children, you give an automatic license for them to act like children. Most days I feel like I'm in high school. We even get little certificates, pencils, chocolates, and ice cream socials when we've done whatever new (and generally useless) \"selling technique\"  they've dreamed up. Management and supervisors are so out of touch that when they monitor our performance, we actually need to correct them on procedure and policy. I have been in management before (when the job market was better and a college degree from one of the best schools in the nation actually meant something) and I wouldn't dream of doing half the condescending crap that our management does.

Unfortunately, the company will do everything in their power to minimize your ability to break guarantee and earn more money - you can't pick up trips after you've hit 65 hours, which means you'll get assigned low flight hour trips that scheduling intentionally gives you in order to prevent overpaying. Such is life in a corporation this large, though.\r\n\r\nPoor Relationships - Between Crew Scheduling and Flight Attendants, it is absolute war 24.7. Be prepared to treat every conversation as if you were on the stand in the court room - except that if they attempt something that is contractually illegal, you have to catch them, and if you attempt something illegal, you'll be disciplined or possibly let go.

If you can trade your way into weekend days off (not so easy for new hires) or block days together, then yes, you can fly for free. However, take a look next time you get on a plane to somewhere amazing... how many seats are open before the gap in customers, and then what you can assume are standby flyers? Not many, right? The airlines will do anything to put paying customers in those seats, which means more often than not, free-flyers get screwed.

Free employee parking, full time get  full medical benefits for a round $160 a month including vision, ability to trade hours with other employees (this ability is limited in the Coordinator of airport operations station support as they are a very small group, being an agent is the best trading availability). This department operates from 5:00am to 9:00pm sometime 11:00pm. After working in the department for 1 year, you can transfer/apply to other areas of the united airlines and transfer to a different state.

The details for the job description is not what you think it is. For this position, the details NEVER fully explained what exactly you\u2019ll be doing. Hopefully they change this but I don\u2019t think they will. The position for Coordinator of Airport Operarions Station Support is basically a call center for the customer service agents and ramp agents. It\u2019s non stop phone calls from customer service agents, ramp agents, supervisors and everyone. It\u2019s a department that is basically data input for allocation of man power staffing and overtime they signed up for. You have to read their entire union contract because it\u2019s a constant argument with them when they call about why someone else got over time and they didn\u2019t, why they did get the hours they signed up for, and a whole bunch of other scheduling elements . Your WILL not enjoy this position if you\u2019re not use to a call center environment. The supervisors are very young , VERy Unprofesjsonal, and are too laid back. They need mature employees  in that department. But if they don\u2019t explain the honest details of that department even the mature adults will resign. If you do go to an interview, after you apply, it will first start with a video interview, then an in person interview then an offer if you\u2019re selected. Pleas please make sure you ask in the interview exactly what the duties are in this position. The title is just a fancy title to entice people because the name they have for this department is resource planning. It\u2019s in the business management department. The department recently has changed and been in effect for only about 2 years or so. In two years, 10 people have  been hired and quit because of the call center like environment and the deceiving title of the job post along with how it\u2019s detailed. They have the same details/duties attached to two if not more job posting. Not sure if it\u2019s just negligence on their part about the posting or it\u2019s a fraud to get people with great business background to apply then get them stuck I that position because so many people don\u2019t want to work in that department. But the enter department is shady on how they post the ad and hire.  I worked for United Airliens for over a decade, and then reapplied and got this position so I know the infrastructure of united airlines. What you\u2019re reading of what I wrote comes from validity not a disgruntled ex employee. I too quit the position becuase it was FAR from what they had in the post.  You will work in a very small office in the basement of the airport, with approximately 7 to 8 cubicles. The office has a huge window type that opened up not to the inside for breeze but to the hallway of the basement for ramp agents and customer service agent to come up to and ask you questions. Even the employees that work in that department are looking for other jobs. If you do decided to take on this job, PLEASE, do not quit your other job if you have one. Take a leave to see if you\u2019ll like the position first. The turnover rate in this department is VERY high. Also, you work so many hours in this department you won\u2019t have time to utilize your free travel because you get only two days off which will most likely be during the week. Agents in customer service and ramp have the best flexibility to utilize their free flying. \r\n\r\nNo paid sick days, 6 months probation and if your evaluation isn\u2019t God\u2019s you get let go. They have extremely strict rules so don\u2019t think for one second that they will feel sorry for you becuase they won\u2019t. You are easily replaced.  The moral in this department is very bad! IF you can deal with the inconsistency, call center like environment, working 8-12 hours a day in the basement of the airport in a work environment that has very low moral, stay with it for 1 years then transfer out, then go for it! Other than that, I personally had choices and resigned with in a few weeks. Not even the free flying could keep me in that position.\r\n\r\nYou have to ask yourself before taking this position, what are your long term goals you\u2019re  looking for in United Airlines?  The airline industry isn\u2019t what it use to be. Those that worked for the airlines many years ago know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.

From what we have been told so far, the flight benefits will no longer have the drawing power they once had and flying as a passrider will be next to impossible.  The vaunted Continental Culture is being slaughtered.  The degree of politicking, lying, and outright unethical treatment of a vast majority of employees is astounding, from the average employee's point of view.  It seems clear so far that a majority of the management team selected from Continental to join the 'new' United were NOT the folks that made the Continental Culture a premier employment opportunity.  Additionally, the management 'grunts' that made Continental the success it was, fostering the camaraderie and productive environment, are in most cases being treated as expendable fodder.  It is difficult to see past all the jockeying for the few positions in the merged company to believe it will be an environment worth working in or a company you want to be involved with.

Even with good intention, the lack of initiative, fairness or explanation leaves team feeling unsupported and reliant on senior teammates for guidance. The overall lack of transparency when it comes to evaluating performance, merit increases and promotions results in questioning of favoritism, bias and discrimination. \r\n\r\nThis role transitioned from Corporate Communications to Contact Centers, and as a result came with some cultural changes. This job is directly centered in customer service, and while there are some appreciative interactions, you do deal with a brunt of anger and disappointed customers.

Even getting business cards, which cost about $5 to the company, is difficult for some employees. So while the company was making historic profits, company policy and actions led to a very disenfranchised work force, and the day to day environment can be very toxic.

A lot of people like to just complain without really thinking about if they are putting in their best efforts and not ; the company owes them, not vice versa.

Not only do you receive flight benefits for your immediate family (children under 25) but you also receive these benefits for your parents.  What this means is that you have access to flight information and can use that information to predict the best time and the best location to use your benefits.  For your immediate family and parents, you have the opportunity to fly coach for FREE.  If you choose to upgrade, you pay an average of $20, depending on where you'd like to travel to get a first class upgrade.  So, while everyone in coach is squeezed in the back section of the plane will be doing without food/snacks, you'll be in the comfy seats enjoying your favorite bevarage and getting first class service for a couple of bucks.  \r\n\r\nOutside of the flight benefits, another reason to work for United is the relazed work environment.  For the most part, work/life balance was determined mostly by your role, but in my particular role, I had a laptop and could easily work when it was convenient for me to do so.\r\n\r\nFinally, like most great companies, the people component stands out.

It was at the point where they had to let people go and didn't have time to plan or mitigate the risks.  Many of the downsides were recognized and they started to make better management decisions to improve employee relations and technology.  When companies are in crisis, they tend to let go many of the people development projects and activities to keep employees motivated and encouraged to work through issues.   One issue I found with United, again similar to many organizations, related to communications.  Management level communications were not transparant enough and employees were not in the loop with decisions that effected them or their projects. \r\n\r\nMy suggestions to current employees is to make the best of a bad situation by being positive and look towards the future.
