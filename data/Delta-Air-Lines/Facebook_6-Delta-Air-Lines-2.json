Before the system change it was Bi weekly pay so you can get sick or take time off For a week or 2 and still will get a pay check. Now it\u2019s not so much and you will need to fly and work every week in order to get a decent pay check. You basically can\u2019t afford to get sick and they kind of discourage you from calling off from being sick. The sick policy is atrocious so you better hope you don\u2019t get sick or else you will get penalized in your record or have a meeting with supervisor. If you are on a multiple day trip you get paid flight hours and time away from base (on layovers) depending On how many day trips you are working. (1-6).
