Virtue signaling messages tell us October is \"national disability employment awareness month\" and not mention it's breast cancer awareness month? The executives all pile on whatever the message du jour is like they were campaigning for office. They say \"bring your whole self\" and encourage openness but it's pretty clear they are all in lockstep with central messaging and it's anything but encouraging for the kind of independent thinkers you'd want in an organization. The stock has been dropping lately and while that's industry-wide, it seems like the company leadership is not taking business seriously or talking about what we're here to do. There's no good method for feeding back UPWARDS to leaders, and there are many who need it. Technically savvy leaders are great, but they lack the skills to optimize organizational performance and it suffers at the expense of their substitution of technical involvement for team and organizational management. It's very common that your VP is mad at you because they don't like the decision some other VP made and want you to reverse it.

Management will make you work 60 hour weeks, then tell you \u201cif you\u2019re working 60 hours you\u2019re doing something wrong\u201d. They\u2019ll give you an exorbitant workload, tell you what to prioritise, and then full on yell at you in front of team members if you don\u2019t finish what they told you not to prioritise. When I told my old boss I had covid, she told me \u201cdon\u2019t get a covid test and don\u2019t report anything if you have gotten a covid test because I don\u2019t want you to be out of work for 2 weeks\u201d. They give raises based on your initial salary negotiations, regardless of the quality of work you complete. To add to that last statement, after my first raise I was making less money than people who started after me, with less experience, BEFORE they got their raise. Management will take 20-30 days off per year, and work from home more than 60% of the time; meanwhile, they tell you that you\u2019re expected to be onsite 100% of the time and force you to log your time off if you work remote for even half a day. Don\u2019t think about taking more than 5 days off in a year. Finally, don\u2019t even THINK about telling your boss you are overwhelmed. I had a meeting with my old boss where I very calmly and professionally told her that I was overwhelmed from working 11-12 hours per day, every single day, and that our team needed more help. She then went to HR and told them that I cussed her out in front of my teammates, resulting in my termination. It was a blatant lie that very easily could have been disproven, but HR chose to blindly side with my manager. The reason for this is simple; it costs less money to fire an engineer and rehire one than it does a manager. This was my experience in MTO (manufacturing technical operations). I won\u2019t state my specific team, but this was a manager who had multiple documented complaints and pending investigations (plural) through HR.

Media publications, in particular, tend to herald it as the \"Google of biotech\" and for better or for worse the recruiting team tries to play up this image. A couple pros I found: \r\n- Brilliant people. Like, really really smart. A lot of PhDs, MDs, dual MBA/MS degrees walking around. A lot of folks with very in depth knowledge about a relatively novel and admittedly complicated field. I was particularly impressed by the bioinformatics folks as well as some of the more seasoned process engineers.\r\n- Beautiful campus. Lots of well-designed buildings, coffee bars, koi ponds, an onsite gym. This was very much a pre-COVID perk, but for aspiring applicants it should be open as time goes on. \r\n- If you're in HQ, then you can live in San Diego. People really like to ham this up when getting folks to join. It's true, San Diego is very nice, but the location can be a double edged sword. More on this later.\r\n- Working for a \"winner\". Remember that board game you played as a kid, the one with Boardwalk and Park Place? Yeah, that's Illumina's market share in the industry. It's not a surefire protector against layoffs and the like, but it does help a bit with job stability and gives you a \"brand name\".\r\n- Vacation benefits. I have some issues with the entire comp/benefits package (more on that below) but the vacation benefits are amazing. 2 mandated shutdowns a year + FTO. FTO is also a double edged sword as that depends a lot on your management/org structure, but I was fortunate enough in my Illumina experience to have management that was supportive of vacation and wellness.", "cons": "A lot of my downsides aren't new: they have been expressed in multiple reviews here and both in internal employee surveys.\r\n- Lower velocity & higher bureaucracy: The company is growing, and with that comes layers upon layers of bureaucracy, multiple reorgs, and a lack of clear vision from upper management. Everyone is trying to do everything at once, there's not enough high visibility projects to go around, and everyone wants a piece of the pie.\r\n- When Everything's on Fire, Nothing Is: This has been mentioned in previous reviews, but there definitely is a culture in the GQO org of \"I need this, and I need this now.\" Priority is not assigned, and if it is then it is always at the highest priority. Not only is it exhausting and a lead-in to burnout, it also numbs the employee to responding to an issue if it actually *is* high priority. \"Oh this request is high priority? Yeah, so were the last 5. Just throw it in the back of the queue.\"\r\n- Meetings: Everything is a meeting, and maybe about 50% of these things need to be. Everything needs to be thrown in a PowerPoint, and maybe about 50% of these things need to be.\r\n- Compensation: I said in the Pros that vacation is nice, but compensation is anything but. I actually debated putting this one here because, if you work at Illumina and are reading this, odds are you already know that compensation is poor.

Politics, recognition, and promotions are blatantly biased along these lines.\n\nOne particularly disturbing manifestation of the favoritism is a \u201cfishing\u201d process by which expertise or experience not available internally is acquired. External subject matter experts (SME\u2019s/\u201dfish\u201d) are lured with best-in industry compensation and significant RSU grants. After on-boarding, the \u201cfish\u201d is compelled to integrate their expertise and ensure knowledge transfer to legacy employee(s). Within a few years, as the SME nears completion of implementation of needed systems, processes, and associated knowledge transfer, they are \u201cthrown back\u201d - suddenly and actively encouraged and often even forced to separate from Illumina. Their unvested RSU\u2019s (as well as any annual bonus) that were used as bait are forfeited and their newly implemented systems and teams transferred to the legacy staff. \u201cFishing\u201d is much more effective for Illumina than hiring temporary consultants in at least 3 ways: (1) Forfeiture of the RSU grant and bonus enables an approx 30% annualized cost savings in compensation vs. consultants; (2) Consultants with appropriate expertise are often challenging to locate; (3) Permanent employees are psychologically more integrated and so much more effective than consultants in driving change and knowledge transfer to legacy staff. \n\nHere are some ways you can protect yourself from being \u201cfished\u201d: (A) Recognize potential red flags during the hiring process - job description that is not industry-standard, overly specific in scope, or would make more sense as a temporary consultant contract rather than a permanent position; interview process and on-boarding that exclude or obscure key collaborators, trainees, managers, or directs; excessively generous comp package, especially initial RSU grant; (B) After your employment begins, Legacy Illumina colleague(s) you never met during the hiring process are introduced as your knowledge transfer partners, particularly when they seem to be on a cross-functional career development rotation or lack the background, aptitude, interest, or even competence needed; at the same time, you are not being developed, trained, or offered growth opportunities by your management; (C) Openly hostile, unethical, and subversive behaviors directed at you by legacy staff are condoned by HR and Sr. Management; (D) You receive positive feedback and performance reviews while you are experiencing (B and C); (E) Include a termination-without cause-accelerated RSU vesting and bonus payout clause in your employment contract; (F) Expect a 1-3 year run and proactively develop an exit strategy.

It\u2019s a great place to be if you\u2019re looking for experience while solving real world problems and working in a fast paced environment. Illumina also promotes people faster than other biotech companies and embraces new technology more frequently than its counterparts. It\u2019s a fascinating place to be if you\u2019re looking to make a difference. \n\nFrancis de Souza, the CEO, embodies traits of a modern leader. During company meetings, he speaks thoughtfully and comes across as caring. Aimee Hoyt, the Chief People Officer, has tried to put in policies that demonstrate a culture of care for employees. For example, during the Covid pandemic, the company has provided one time Covid care packages to all employees.", "cons": "1. Unrealistic timelines - the common joke at illumina is \u201call deliverables were due yesterday.\u201d \n\n2. Too much work - this ties in with unrealistic timelines. Among colleagues, we often talk about how much work we have on our plates, and it feels overwhelming to have so much work all the time. It often feels like no matter how much you get done, there\u2019s always more to do. In a way, this is a good problem to have. But, we often talk about being overworked at ILMN. And, in times like Covid, the situation is exacerbated. Those who work hard are working even harder. At the same time, there\u2019s a lot of dead wood that\u2019s sitting around without any accountability that needs pruning. Another joke among colleagues is \u201cit is very hard to get fired at Illumina these days\u201d unless you do something terribly wrong (e.g. sexual harassment or something similar). In other words, doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t work, you won\u2019t get fired even if you don\u2019t produce outcomes as long as you\u2019re putting in your 9-5. This is not good for a company that wants to continue as the market leader in the genomics space.\n\n3. Meeting obsessed work culture - ah, so many meetings. Way too many. A lot! Think back to back meetings starting 8 am all the way till 6:30 or 7 pm, almost every day, and without breaks. Sometimes, there\u2019s no time to eat and/ or take a bio break or stretch. This has been exacerbated further during the pandemic. During my decade long career, I\u2019ve never before (ILMN) worked at a company so obsessed with meetings. People often come to meetings without a set agenda of what they want to accomplish. And, then often these meetings end with no meaningful outcomes/ actions/ decisions. Which means, there\u2019s often a need for follow up meetings. This is hugely inefficient. Maybe, this is endemic to my work groups/ colleagues. But, I work with a lot of cross functional teams within GQO, and this is definitely prevalent. \n\n4. A PowerPoint obsessed work culture - everything that needs discussion is thrown on a PowerPoint. The amount of time people spend on preparing PowerPoint presentations is outrageously high. And, at what cost to the company? One can only dare wonder because this is prevalent across all levels with the company. Such \u201cbusy-work\u201d must be discouraged. Maybe, we can learn from Amazon where PowerPoint presentations are banned.\n\n5. Overlapping job functions across teams - GQO is the worst org within Illumina when it comes to fostering overlap. Multiple teams of people across different groups often trying to do the same things creates duplication of effort and a sense of uneasiness in work relationships. It fosters confusion, and a sense of unhealthy competition and jealousy because everyone wants to do the next big NPI project, as if there life depends on it. People often show off their involvement in the next NPI project to others. \n\n6. Issue Flavor of the week - there\u2019s always a burning issue during any given week. Most people gravitate towards the issue flavor du jour, meet a bunch of times on it and then are quick to move on to the next burning topic without ensuring resolution. As a result, a lot of issues/ problems resurface from time to time because they were never resolved in a structured way the first time around. All this creates a lot of noise and distractions which makes it difficult to focus. \n\n7. Persistent disconnect between executive leadership in GQO and ground reality - it appears as if leadership in GQO is not in touch with the ground game, especially at HQ. There\u2019s a lot of talk about SD One culture, but GQO leadership is removed from the realities on the ground. It\u2019s a bit of a boy\u2019s club, where people scratch each other\u2019s backs and go on offsites. And, non performing leaders are able to escape scrutiny and accountability on outcomes when projects are delayed. People who work hard, who produce outcomes are often not well supported, and then there are some departments (e.g. FoF) that enjoy protection from accountability for God knows what reason. A lot of FoF led projects are delayed. But, there\u2019s no accountability. On the contrary, such departments also end up getting more resources because they\u2019re \u201cdelayed\u201d with their deliverables and need help to push things past the finish line. By contrast, those teams that consistently demonstrate strong work ethic of delivering more with fewer resources suffer the most in such an environment. They\u2019re denied access to resources because there\u2019s only so much money in the company pot to draw from. Accountability is key if Illumina desires to stay competitive in the long run. Those who perform to produce desirable outcomes must be rewarded by giving them more resources to achieve even more results. Those departments/ work groups that don\u2019t produce timely outcomes must not be given more resources. Such a culture is very demotivating to those groups that strive to excel and produce timely outcomes while dealing with resource constraints and aggressive timelines."}, {"review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay, and good people.", "cons": "Lots of work to do."}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Associate Scientist in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "it is a good company", "cons": "Things can't always be perfect"}, {"review_title": "Innovative and Fast-Paced Company; Passionate and Knowledgeable Employees", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Engineer I in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Employees are passionate about our tech, incredibly knowledgeable, and hard working to keep up with the fast pace of the company.

It is very very hard for people that make up the 8% to get promoted, efficient training, and the opportunity to get hired in other departments due to the conflict of interest and unconscious bias. It seems like there's a buddy system that allows certain individuals opportunity. The hurtful and untrustworthy thing about this situation is management and HR have been informed about this and they do nothing to pervert things like this from spilling over. For individuals that would like the opportunity to apply and get hired in another department. It's extremely hard giving the conflict of interest and unconscious bias. Some hiring managers hangout, share the same ethnic background in which leaves that 8% out of an opportunity. I\u2019ve personally seen this happen countless times. It definitely reshaped me as a person when I worked there. I stop having the drive I once had. Myself of steam is very low. They took all that away from me, it\u2019s not ok.

I figured I could quit my current job earlier than planned, and I said yes. Everything was finalized, including background checks, assigning an employee ID, and sending me a company laptop. However, this decision only left me with 1 week between jobs, and by the end of that week I realized I needed more time to rejuvenate before starting somewhere new (2020 as people know was a particularly hard year). So I reached out to ask the recruiter what was possible to push out my start date back to the original date I had agreed to. Rather than responding with a \"no we can't\" Illumina chose to rescind my offer on the basis they had \"concerns around my commitment to join the team\". I was dumbfounded, I was only asking a question. I had already quit my job (which meant I did not qualify for unemployment), and since we are in the middle of a pandemic I was then left jobless without an income or health insurance, and all of this took place a week before Thanksgiving (job hunting during the holidays as anyone knows is almost non-existent). This sort of scenario is unheard of, and shows a deep lack of compassion or understanding. And to top it all off, after a month had gone by and they still hadn't inquired about the laptop sitting in my living room, I reached out to them because I wanted it gone, and they threatened me with LEGAL ACTION claiming I refused to return the laptop! I was merely requesting they pick it up or at least send a return box and label so that I didn't have to waste any of my time or money trying to package it up to send back. Talk about salt in the wound. I would NEVER recommend working at this company to anyone.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, I suspect something else was going on and I ended up being a casualty of a business decision for the team.

Recently, myself included. The severance package offered is not the greatest and rather than trying to retain you and helping you to find other internal positions, the company pairs you with an external career assistance recruiter that does very little  to help you find a new position externally.\r\n\r\nUNPROFESSIONAL:\r\nFor a company that \"cares\" about their employees, the way that lay offs are handled is in my opinion, completely unprofessional. There is no transparency or warnings for employees. My entire department was on the edge for months wondering when and who was going to be let go after rumors started circulating.  Whenever clarification or reassurance was needed, directors and vps would provide vague answers like \"all I can say is changes are coming\".  Not exactly the kind of thing you want to hear when you are being pushed even further to extend your resources and take on more work. It is demotivating and unnecessary stress.\r\n\r\nThe actual layoff itself was also unprofessional and confusing. I received a meeting invite with no subject. The meeting lasted a total of 5 minutes. I was handed a packet, told to read it through on my own, and that it was optional from that point forward for me to come into the office and continue to work, yet I was told to turn in my badge and computer after the meeting and gather my things from my desk.  I was not allowed to speak to anyone and someone would escort me out. It  was a bit embarrassing and traumatic since it seemed like more of a firing than a lay-off. Even more infuriating was that they timed it right before performance evaluations and raises hit.\r\n\r\nI was encouraged to continue to apply internally and I was lucky to land an interview for a similar position within  my ideal department. During the entire process, the recruiter made me feel like I was a top candidate and made it sound like I was a shoe-in for hire.  The day before my final interview I received an offer from a different org and tried to do right by being transparent with the illumina recruiter. I gave them a head's up and asked about the details of my candidacy and the length of the process.  In a very unprofessional manner, my third interview was cancelled 2 hours before and I  was told they were going with a candidate with additional experience and they wanted to let me continue the interview since nothing was set in stone.  It was very disheartening news to hear and made me feel like my time was being wasted and I was only given the interviews because of the lay-off situation I was in.\r\n\r\nNO ALIGNMENT AND TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS:\r\nEach department kinda roams feral and does what they want without researching the impact and notifying other departments causing more work and stress for others.\r\nAdditionally to this, job roles are not well defined or not grouped correctly so compliance gaps in training are created or irrelevant training is being inappropriately assigned.\r\nUnvalidated systems are feeding data into validated systems and later on discoveries are made that certain pieces of data are no longer in use, have been change, or were never populated upstream and causes more cleanup efforts\r\nNo ownership for tackling ever increasing issues. Teams pass the buck between departments. \r\n\r\nLIMITED RESOURCES\r\nMany departments are understaffed forcing others to take on more work or share the workload with other understaffed departments. \r\n\r\nHIRING CONSULTING FIRMS\r\nConsulting firms constantly come in, set up systems or provide content, do their damage, then dip out, leaving FTEs to clean up the mess and adding to their workloads\r\n\r\nFOOD POISOINING\r\nEveryday there is a new post about someone getting sick from the ICafe food, or catering, or something random like finding plastic in the sandwiches.\r\n\r\nBATHROOM/BREAKROOM FACILITIES\r\nAre disgusting. For as fancy as the buildings look on the outside, you'd be surprised at how disgusting the facilities are on the inside. Every 3 days the toilets back up and overfill leaving a constant lingering stench, wet toilets and floors. \r\n\r\nThe breakrooms also have an issue with brown water on occasion and sinks backing up. Some people also disrespect and disregard the cleaning and maintenance staff and create more work for them by failing to pick up after themselves if they make a mess. They look down upon them and it's sad to see.\r\n\r\nOPEN WORK SPACES\r\nCreates for noisey  and nosey environments and lack of privacy.  \r\n\r\nGROWTH\r\nThe company has been expanding its lab spaces and thus restricting more and more buildings and floors and limiting already scarce meeting rooms. Good luck trying to book anything at HQB1. More growth also opens the question about where are the displaced departments going to be housed? I3 is at capacity in terms of parking and many now have to park at HQ and shuttle over which makes it slightly more inconvenient."}, {"review_title": "Innovative, Smart, Driven and Passionate.
