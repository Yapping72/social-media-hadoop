Some of the VPs though claim to be impartial but are dumb and can easily be played by their immediate reportees. Never ever mess with your reporting manager because even if they are wrong and they behave in a wrong manner with you never retaliate or put a feedback to your skip level manager (though the VPs claim they will keep the feedback anonymous but they don't keep it anonymous and report it back to your manager - AVPs) then these managers gets in revenge mode and try to screw up your life. \r\nSome of the VPs are so dumb that they don't even realize they are getting played by their direct reportees (AVPs) which impacts everyone down below. Some of the VPs are very cunning and try to save their job only (totally opposite of Citi's pillars about showcasing leadership) like in the current situation of Citi wrapping up retail business in APAC, some of the VPs just got their back up ready by taking ownership of the North American teams (even if there was no need of that) just to secure their own job and these are those VPs that when the news of Citi wrapping up the business in APAC countries broke out were the first ones to keep long meetings to tell other team members not to worry and everyone's job is safe. If u really believe in that why did you take up ownership of some of the analytics teams that currently handles North-America businesses. Beware of such hypocrites because all what matters is their own job security, growth.\r\nAlso, beware of people who used to manage APAC analytics teams previously and now are handling a small portion of North America analytics and APAC analytics because these people care about themselves.\r\nSome VPs who are leading workgroups like cultural committee and arranges FGD (focus group discussions) to collect feedback about managers and work quality - stay as far as possible from them because trusting them will cost you alot. It did to me so be very cautious.\r\n\r\nAnnual Survey - This is a very good initiative by Citi but the employees come to know about the score at a Director level (which comprises multiple teams) but some VPs don't even disclose their own scores or even their direct reportees score. This creates a sense of distrust because you don't want to disclose the scores bcoz if its low you need to work on those areas to improve but you really don't want to put effort instead be in limelight by leading workgroups like cultural committee, awards and recognition etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHR- I would say onboarding is the only thing HR does properly, for rest of the things you won't realize there is a HR department also. Only for showoff they tell we are reachable over mail etc. But they never reach back out to you.\r\n\r\nWork Life balance is pathetic because mostly APAC analytics have partners based out of Singapore and some of these partners log out qt sharp 6 PM their time but they want things in your mailbox urgently for that it does not matter even if you work the whole night\r\nSome VPs/AVPs behave in same way and it's not a one off things it's a recurrent and frequent thing"}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Oct 2021", "job_title": "AML Risk Management in Subang Jaya", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Good people\n-Knowledge center for the process.", "cons": "-Proper documentation can be hard sometimes. \n-many stakeholders create a lot of barriers."}, {"review_title": "Not Great", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Tucson, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, lots of schedules to choose from", "cons": "I dislike how they keep finding ways to add more work for reps but also finding a way to decrease pay!"}, {"review_title": "Great learning curve, friendly colleagues", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Many projects to liaise with other departments\nGreat exposure to business environment\nNetworking opportunities\nGlobal environment and standards", "cons": "Working life balance is non existent\nBonus is very little"}, {"review_title": "High Stress, Low Pay, High Turnover", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Fraud Investigations in San Antonio, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Different shifts to choose from", "cons": "Hard to take vacation, incredibly low pay, impossible expectations, high management turnover"}], [{"review_title": "Internship FMA program", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Finance Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great mentorship and welcoming environment", "cons": "Low salary for a bank"}, {"review_title": "Pleassure working", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Assistant Vice President in Warsaw, Masovia", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Challenging work environment and always new work items to look for and learm", "cons": "Initially it was always extended hours + weekend work."}, {"review_title": "Friendly", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Executive Assistant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good learnings opportunity were given", "cons": "Long hours, inflexible hours and workloads"}, {"review_title": "It\u2019s okay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Credit Risk Analyst in Irving, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay, vacation days, work from home and overtime", "cons": "Depending on the department it can feel like your working in a startup."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Sales Associate in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing company, one of the most famous banks.

I got into citi (degree field is irrelevant) but later only realised they were probably just mass hiring coz it\u2019s a new department, kinda feels like a trap for fresh grads \r\n- very strict regulations/controls, they\u2019re always monitoring every single thing you do, and if you cross the threshold you\u2019re always to blame\r\n- constantly indecisive, the methodology is always tweaking here and there and we\u2019re not even provided an explanation as to why there\u2019s so many annoying little changes being made \r\n- limited career growth e.g switching to global banking, the job scope is very limited and honestly not much transferable skills, also you have to work for min. 2 years + get promoted at least once to \u2018qualify\u2019 for internal mobility \r\n- most of
