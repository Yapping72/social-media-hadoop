Later you will realize what big mistake you have done by accepting to join just for few extra bucks.\r\n\r\nThere could be other good things but you wont be able to leverage them because of the culture created by mgmt.\r\nLeaves - So many but you wont be able to take it.\r\n\r\nClub mahindra - Forget it. You will anyways be able to take limited leaves so you can not plan anything. That has so many constraints as well and 30% of the amount has to be paid my employee.\r\n\r\nAnnual health check up 8k - This is very important as your health will degrade by working here hence you atleast have a tool to measure it.\r\n\r\nCab facility - wont matter because mgmt will schedule scrum calls when you have cabs. So you will always be worried for every single day that should I cancel cab today or not. Taking cab early is not an option because of workload. Later you wont be having any cab so you will eventually start coming by your own vehicle. \r\n\r\nWFH - A nightmare actually. Citi is misusing this policy. You will be asked to connect anytime, anyday because Citi has given wfh. Things to note here is you need to have your own laptop and proper internet. Internet bill will not be reimbursed (In COVID they started reimbursing for below AVP level).\r\nIf you dont have proper system them mgmt will say Citi is paying you so much. Buy multiple screens. There are the words from my SVP.\r\n\r\nDiwali gift of around 2k valuation.\r\n\r\nAs you can see most of these benefits are to lure new joiners to join the organization. These points have made jobs are HR very easy so that they can mention so many benefits working in Citi. These are just for branding the organization. In reality nothing exists on the ground which you will get to know when you are onboarded.", "cons": "- There is no clarity on what exactly you need to do. If you ask your manager (terrible SVP's), they will not respond. You try to reach them by call/email/texts; they would still not respond. Then suddenly one day they will come up and ask where are we with this. Then you start telling them that requirement is not clear, we tried reaching out to you daily but no gains. Now the harassment starts. They will pressurize you to deliver in very short time, every day late night calls, daily requirements changing. You somehow deliver it but later you will get to know that was not at all used/required. There is no use of that feature. Then what was the need of so much unnecessary pressure ?\r\n\r\n- SVP's are so so horrible. They will scold you in front of whole team/floor. They would insult because you were not available on Sunday 2PM to attend SVP's call.\r\nYou will be required to be available 24/7. You are offending management if your are not looking at whatsapp message and not acting accordingly (like responding, logging in to system etc.). Its a real expectation. If you don't do it get ready to be insulted very next day.\r\n\r\n- There is a constant fear daily. What's going to happen next now. Who is going to come up with unrealistic deadline. What exactly suddenly going to come to you in one line, for ex - build a private website, pull data from API's. Now go and understand what to pull, what to show, where to store data, which all API's. No one is going to respond you for any details. You would definitely need to coordinate with other teams but they also wont respond. Your SVP thinks that you are some god who would understand requirements on his own. Then mgmt. will keep on asking about the feature. When you say that no one is responding then that's also your fault. Its like - You don't know how to approach to different teams.\r\n\r\n- If a person is spending some time in cafeteria it means that the person is not LOADED with enough work. His manager will be called in by SVP to check why is he not LOADED enough.\r\n\r\n- There is no uses of any process or tools like Agile/jira. There is no BA,QA, Architect. You are just given things in a line. GO ahead and do it.\r\n\r\n- Leaves - They have so many leaves but man you can not take it. That's like a gold scuffle. This is just for HR to brand the company that we have so many leaves. Management wont let you take. If you take, SVP's will shout on floor or in meetings that you took one week leave 2 months ago, why do you need again. They will insult you till that level where after some time you would start neglecting all these people. You will go in very bad state mentally.\r\n\r\n- No work life balance. Forget about this, you will always be scared of what's going to happen now.\r\n\r\n- There is NO KT at all. Nothing on business side, nothing on tech side. You are expected to understand each and everything when the one liner requirements email comes.\r\n\r\n- SVP's are so fake. SO much interested in fake branding of their org to befool people. When you go inside, you are like what. Seriously its that good an organization ??\r\n\r\nHiring - You are forced to hire female candidate at any cost. Statement from mgmt. - If you are hiring a guy, then he needs to be Rockstar. supper talented. Then only we will approve offer. If a girl, then we are fine with average or below average. Offer approval for a guy will go through lot of troubles.\r\n\r\n- Managers are expected to be intelligent enough to know who is going to leave in near time. When a person from my team resigned, Words from mgmt. - you are not intelligent enough to understand that this person could resign. They always need a scapegoat for any bad thing that happens.\r\n\r\n- There are some apps installed in the machines which calculates your login time, productivity time and most importantly your coding score. So if you were working on some tool or some POC or some new designing/architecture where less coding required, your score will go down. Your manager will be asked why the coding score getting down. You and your manager will be having very hard time explaining things. Think for normal use case where we have less work - you will be worried this time as well because your coding score is going down. Appraisal/promotion decisions are directly taken on these scores. Team effectiveness is judged on the average time team is logged in. Managers will be pressurized that why their team's login-logout time is so less. No one will tell about these tools in HR induction.\r\n\r\n- You will definitely loose your self esteem by working in this organization. I wasted 2 fruitful years of my life working in this organization. They don't have any probation period as well. From day1 your NP is 3 months.\r\n\r\n- I have been asked to purchase an iphone on my own because Citi's email can be opened through that phone only. I was told that you should buy an iphone so that you can look and respond to the emails by checking quickly when you are off work (weekends, holidays and vacations). So basically in order to work during my off time I have to purchase an iphone on my own. So many things we can extract from this statement to understand the culture.\r\n\r\n- Not a SINGLE project/bu party. no outdoor activities at all. \r\n\r\nNew joiners - I would say stay away at any cost please. Believe me. \r\n\r\nThis is my experience in a specific BU and specific team. I am not sure about other BU's and teams.
