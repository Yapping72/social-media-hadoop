Example, medical and dental coverage and it varies according to your job grade. As an RM in Maybank, it will be easy to build connections with various departments/branches/sales ppl within the bank and this should allow you to reach your targets for all your domains. If you are smart enough you can leverage on these connections for some extra dollars as well. When you hit your targets, the rewards are pretty decent. There will be additional campaigns throughout the year to help you boost your sales as well as let you get that extra moolah. And for top achievers, you will be sent on an overseas trip on top of financial rewards. Client database is huge. It is nearly impossible to run out of clients. It all depends on your skill of engaging with clients and eventually closing. As Maybank is an established bank, you have an extensive range of products, even those that don't fall under your targets, that you can offer to your clients. Thus, your client can keep coming back to you for various solutions. You will be a 1 stop solution center for your client's overall financial needs. In terms of resources to do your job, I would say it's pretty endless. The thing you probably need to worry about is competition from other financial institutions and sometimes your peers. Okay not sometimes.", "cons": "Personally, I would say the cons are a toxic work environment and this solely depends on the people in your team/office. I know of other Maybankers who absolutely enjoy going into office or if not at least had good colleagues/supportive Centre Manager. It was not rewarding enough for me. For the targets that you have to achieve and the number of domains you have to hit, it can get overwhelming. However, again this is different for everyone. Extremely competitive. No matter what, when it comes to doing your job, you need to be tough and rough in protecting your portfolio of clients and your sales pipelines. Be cautious who you share information with. If you under perform, you can expect to be drilled into the ground by higher management and this will affect your mental health. You are required to sell/achieve targets despite of market conditions.

They don't care about your work/life balance. Yes it's banking, and yes we are actually human being. Don't compare us (latest by 2 years tenure) with the seniors where they have to work till 12am because you guys don't have enough people back then! \n2. High expectations with a very, very low internal customer appreciations and no welfare whatsoever. Perfect examples are the ones located at Akademi Etiqa. The elevator, the toilets, the office itself, sometimes you have to deal with toilet smells in the morning, sometimes you'll get stuck in the lift for 30 mins or so, sometimes you have to stayback with no aircond on, no place for you to dine, no proper pantry, the microwave is placed next to the printer and shredding machine, etc. \n3. The higher management for team Mantas and eSTR is the worst nightmare. Mantas Head (no name mention), he's a dummy who just sits and listens but nothing is happening. He will repost what people sent to him via email but he doesn't really understand what's the content. Also the oldest TL in Mantas, is the worst of a person behind the scarf she wears. She's demotivating and heartless. Be very careful. While the Estr team, they basically just aim one group of people and talk bad about that group of people openly. One indian lady TL, she's the worst. She'd ask stupid questions about everything on a self explanatory matter. She creates hate.\n4. HR is all over the place, one time you speak with this one, the next day is another. You have to explain again and again, and is it obvious they trying to avoid to do more work. No dedication, and no integrity. Out of 100, only 10 is reliable. I hope.\n5. The system.\n6. They just started with QA system hence their Checkers are with their own styles and if you're not in luck, you'll get the worst.\n7. Ask you to do 10 alerts per day, but the system is out of date, not giving you to apply for OT when you stayback, they have done their so called motion study that maker can achieved 6 alerts per day in average. BUT that's it, they've gone back to 10 and no OT is provided for you to finish up the rest 4."}, {"review_title": "Good company to work with but", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Compliance Officer in Kuala Lumpur", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Prestigious company to work with.", "cons": "Maybank is a company that you should end up with, not to begin with.
