Management was always standing behind us writing down every word that came out of our mouths just to go over it later and tell us how we didn't follow the script or what \"solution\" we should have offered them.  There were phone surveys customers recieved and if they rated any less that a perfect 5 then it was considered a bad shop and management would tell what employee was rated poorly.  Everyone would be upset at the bad shop and it would only make the employee feel terrible that it was their fault.  It happens, you could have an amazing teller and they would be rated a 4 which is still great but Wells Fargo doesn't recognize success.  Worst company I have ever worked for, not to mention the lousy salary for all the long hours if someone was out of balance and the pointless meetings.  It's impossible to get promoted if you don't suck up to management and do great at sales from the day you start.

In the district in which I worked, in less than one year, three District Managers left; at my former store, the Store Manager, every Teller except one and my Personal Banker colleague left the company.  It's well known that Wells Fargo is involved in numerous lawsuits filed by current and former employees; these lawsuits deal (broadly) with an overly aggressive sales culture that allegedly had led to questionable sales behaviors.  In addition, the SEC reportedly is in the process of conducting several probes into Wells Fargo.  In January, Wells Fargo, undoubtedly, because of the negative attention it has been receiving because of the lawsuits and SEC probes, \"rolled out\" a new culture.  Previously, Wells Fargo management frequently throughout the day aggressively pushed Team Members to \"sell, sell, sell\" and told Team Members how many sales they needed to close the sales gaps for themselves and their stores and what potentially would happen if the sales numbers were not met and sales gaps not closed.  Now, managers are not supposed to demonstrate this behavior daily; instead, they are to meet with Team Members once weekly to \"review sales goals and sales gaps.\"  The new culture rolled out:  It's all about the customer experience, do right by the customer.  All well and good however, sales goals virtually have remained the same as before.  What managers had expressed verbally throughout the day i.e. \"sell, sell, sell\" now is done by requiring Personal Bankers to fill out workbooks daily, indicating how they are going to improve the customer experience, all of the tasks they need to complete and how they are going to achieve their sales goals.  Managers now review the workbooks at the start of the business day and at the end of the business day. End of business day workbook reviews always conclude by the manager asking how the Team Members will improve their performance the next business day.  The aggressive sales culture remains, only now it is \"kinder and gentler.\"  People are moving on from Wells Fargo, in search of environments in which they are able to do their jobs, do the right things and not have to endure a truly aggressive sales culture that has led to questionable behaviors to achieve sales."}, {"review_title": "System QA Analyst review, Home Mortgage, St Louis Park MN", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Systems QA Analyst in Saint Louis Park, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Easy to balance personal and professional work.\r\n- Easy pace at work.", "cons": "I am not even sure where to begin with and I really hope someone at the higher level takes a look at this post for company's sake at the least.\r\nFirst off, there is a lot of bias between non favorites (who stand up for what is right) and favorites (who butter up the management AKA tech managers and VP).

If anything, you will work harder, because all the calls not requiring \"special handling\" will get routed to you. You will take back to back calls all day every day, while your team members chat about their lives and weekend plans.

If someone calls in looking to refinance, sure, but if someone calls in and immediately launches in to \"why weren't my taxes paid out of my escrow?!?!\", and there's a note on their account to try to sell them another mortgage, it is held against you if you don't do it! The survey system is ridiculous, their opinion of your service is lumped right in with how the customer perceives Well Fargo. The American people don't trust or respect Wells Fargo, and you are not paid enough to try to make the overpaid bosses look good. As an agency employee, you will be treated differently, all my fellow agency employees will back me up on this. Left out of team potlucks, generally left to our own devices to figure stuff out, reminded snidely to \"call Robert Half, or Dysis, or Sparks\" or whoever your employment agency is, if a customer recommends in a review that you get a raise or a compliment.

If I had an actual interest in banking as a career, I would undoubtedly stay with this company for my entire life. Management works hand in hand with you to help you succeed. Upper management makes regular visits to the branches to check in on the staff and assist us in moving up. Believe me, if you are ambitious and a hard worker, there is no way NOT to do well with this company. You don't necessarily need to have any sort of degree either. If someone were to start out at Wells with just a high school diploma, you can still easily move up. Simply do well! Pay attention, ask questions, provide customer service, and SMILE. It's that simple. AND, Wells Fargo has a GREAT tuition reimbursement program for it's employees, so if you get a job you can educate yourself to better your career with them after one year and they'll pick up the tab!\r\nWells Fargo really, truly, cares about their employees. The pay is great, especially for an entry level position! Working for a large company such as Wells Fargo offers great job security too. While our economy is doing so poorly, this is a very important aspect of a prospective job. As other banks continue to downsize, Wells Fargo is increasing it's profits. It pays to be helpful too. The incentive pay for sales and customer service is great. There are so many different ways to get bonuses on your paychecks! Catch a fraudulent transaction, get a bonus. Have top customer surveys for the quarter, get a bonus. Achieve a very low sales goal, get a bonus. \r\nIt's easy to get overtime too. There are always branches around that are going to be short staffed. Tell your manager that you are interested in getting some overtime, and they will send you to another branch to help them be staffed accordingly.", "cons": "As any customer service position, you have to deal with some very unruly customers from time to time.
