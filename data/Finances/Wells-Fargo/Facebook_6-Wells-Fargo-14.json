New team members start with 12 or 13 days of PTO, 2 personal holidays, and 2 community service days in addition to regular bank holidays.\n-The top priority managers teach their team is to focus on the customers need through understanding what\u2019s most important to them and not the bank.", "cons": "-Middle management is a joke and half.  My District Manager stays at home 4/5 days a week and managed by emailing reports. I think I may see them once every other month which is not supportive of my career development. Unfortunately, this a trend from market to market. I\u2019m not sure what happens when someone becomes a DM... someone need to look at that.\n-As a Branch Manager, it can be difficult to complete your responsibilities due to staffing issues that never end. It\u2019s hard to be upset, because most of them move to different areas or get promoted. It\u2019s just really hard to get a posting for a new position. \n-Our teller and banker systems are outdated. They have errors and delay customer interactions on a daily basis.\n-There is no sales incentive for doing well. More times than not, a branch that has large volumes of customer traffic will always receive higher payout than smaller branches.  The customers literally come to those branches to apply for accounts. They way the incentive is made, branch balance totals are adjusted so frequently that you never understand if your branch is actually growing!  This makes it difficult for a manager to motivate their team to exceed customer expectations each day. I see where they\u2019re coming from.. why work harder when they\u2019re going to pay you incentive for just coming to work LOL.\n-The pay structure is silly. Like May companies, they make salary decisions based on how easy or difficult is will be to retain you.  So if I live in an area with less jobs equal to mine at other companies, they have a lower risk of me leaving and pay me less. If I live in an area with a lot of competition for my skills, they pay more. This causes team members to get paid less for the same job someone is doing in another area regardless of their work ethic. Raises? 1% if you perform, 2% if you exceed, 3% if you do some type of sexual favor for your boss if you can find them after they give you keys to the branch. I\u2019m kidding about the 3%. That\u2019s too generous for them. \n-The training has become the worst I\u2019ve ever seen at a company of this size. When I first began in 2012, they taught more in-depth material that allowed you to come into the branch with a basic idea of what you\u2019re doing. Now, my team members come in the branch with two weeks of questions to ask. Unfortunately, the manager has to then choose to do their tasks or support the team member by actually training them. Of course I choose my team members development which leads to extra hours in the Branch for myself after close for everything else. \n-I feel appreciated by upper management, but it\u2019s lip service most of the time. I think they expect my direct manager to do the leg work to make me feel valued and that\u2019s missing completely. After numerous positive customer reviews, the recognition I receive is only based on me teaching other people how to achieve the same business results. Can I at least get a breakfast muffin? Or even an empty bag with an imaginary muffin? Ok, well let\u2019s start with a thank you and go from there  :)\n-Geez look at the time - by now you may be thinking I\u2019m a disgruntled employee, but I\u2019m not. I just feel the bank could support areas better than they are and meet the commitments they strive to meet with their team members like they attempt to do with customers."}, {"review_title": "Good job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Feb 2021", "job_title": "CCSR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good job to work at good pay", "cons": "No cons just hard work"}, {"review_title": "Good bank", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Security Consultant in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, work life balance, technical opportunities", "cons": "Stagnant learning, climbing the ladder is difficult"}], [{"review_title": "My experience has been very positive.

From lower to higher management the entire company is CORRUPT. Work abuse, favoritism, intimidation, bias/racism... you name it\r\n\r\nThey mask it all very well by providing every employee with bogus corporate training and videos that make you believe you're in a safe work environment but you're not. They try to give you the time to take them all but no one ever does because they'd rather use that time to do other activities that help them either keep their job or keep from getting written up. The way they approach development and issues with your work is patronizing. Every meeting is just a series of questions that lead to another question that eventually lead to an explanation of how you're incompetent as an employee. They didn't say it, you say it, so its an HR friendly of telling you you suck, work harder. When you do get something right they pat you on the back and say nice but how come you didn't do this ALSO. The fear of lower level employees drives the lowkey intimidation all of management know they have. Everyone is SCARED to speak up in fear of retaliation. Then the company falls back on the most bogus no retaliation policy that comes way of those useless trainings and videos I mentioned before. So you speak up on the fact retaliation is still happening despite the policy and then the company hides behind an HR department that's suppose to protect you. HR is an absolute joke. Opened several claims to HR even in groups involving half the team members to no avail. Every answer back from them was a professional and corporate friendly way of saying, \"we understand and empathize with your problem but we don't agree, deal with it.\" or \"we understand we're going to talk to upper management\" then upper management sides with the people you have a problem with because they're buddies. \r\n\r\nRidiculous work expectations and performance that's globally expected due to the intimidation factor and complete lack of confidence and support. You will feel overworked and absolutely dread or fear coming to work \r\n\r\nDon't make any last minute or even 1-2 week plans in advance you have to ask for vacation 4 weeks in advance and still hope it doesn't interfere with anyone else's schedule\r\n\r\nSunday off but 2nd day off is completely random \r\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the WORST commission structure of all time. especially now that they're apologizing for opening fake accounts. And whatever commission you make gets paid 3 months later, what a joke. \r\n\r\nLastly depending on your location a certain ethnic group will most likely dominate the work place even up to higher management so you'll experience racism/favoritism to some guaranteed degree if you're not part of that group. But remember they'll mask that too and keep it under wraps with those same bogus policies and a PHENOMENAL HR team.
