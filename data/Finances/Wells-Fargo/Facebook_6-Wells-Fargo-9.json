We were given a chance to work remote temporarily for 4 months and they had announced it would be for Business PPP loans. I agreed to transfer roles from Personal Banker so I would have more exposure in that thinking it would be a temporary position that would last a few months. We go through training and it turns out they transferred us to a regular call center for customer service having nothing to do with PPP loans. It was a way for Wells Fargo to remove personal bankers and make room for more licensed bankers. Prior to my decision to work remote I was waiting to start my licensed banker training and the district manager had announced they removed sponsoring the license. Now I am stuck working in the call center within Wells Fargo and have all this PTO time that is impossible to schedule within a call center and there are no holiday hours because the call center is available 24/7. I wasn\u2019t the only Personal Banker that this happened to and several others were tricked into thinking it would be a temporary position to enhance our skills in Business. It was described as such by our District manager- and the licensed bankers who applied were the only people who were able to return from the \u201ctemporary position\u201d they were all called back in to their branches. When bankers started speaking up and we all communicated in training that this wasn\u2019t what we signed up for they \u201cescalated\u201d it to HR and we\u2019ve heard nothing since. The unfortunate part of this all is that call center locations are located in more rural areas and there is no call center in the state I am in. So what\u2019s going to happen to us that are not physically located near these call centers when everything opens up? Remote work is not going to be forever especially as a call center representative. I believe by then they will weed us out instead of furloughing us or firing us because the company wasn\u2019t doing well during COVID this is the tactic they used to displace us slowly since they didn\u2019t want any bad media for what they are doing to us. I wish they had just let us go before because we would have received unemployment benefits at the time since we didn\u2019t receive any bonus for working during covid as essential workers. They will end up giving us an ultimatum as things begin to reopen- either quit or move to the state where the call center location is open to resume work.
