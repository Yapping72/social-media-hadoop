Below are the things I enjoyed most.\r\nThe work is (mostly) meaningful, and sometimes treated as professionals by management. The people are technically savvy (some even smarter than myself, LOL) and really great to work with. I got along really well with most others, as long as we all focused on the premise that we are working for the same employer trying to accomplish roughly the same goal: building a better Wells Fargo one day at a time and one person at a time.\r\nThe pay is really good. Healthcare and related benefits are decent, but could be better. Paid holidays and PTO are satisfactory. Increasing PTO is a good way to keep employees. 401k matching to 6 percent is a gift, as was the ability to obtain an internal loan from the 401k balance was a lifesaver. \r\nThe corporate cell phone and other technical equipment made the work more bearable. Although some years were considered \"tight\" and expenses were minimized or eliminated, having a corporate cell phone to separate personal and business calls makes all the difference. Also, having an option for a MacBook was much better than not allowing them at all (Thank you for merging with Wachovia Bank), and also allowed me to perform calculations and programming much better than the Windows laptops.\r\nI enjoyed the 16 hours paid volunteer time, as well as matched donations to non-profits. Wells Fargo did a great job encouraging volunteerism and giving back to communities.", "cons": "As someone with \"disabilities\", there were little accommodations that actually helped me feel like I was being heard, understood, and accepted by my immediate management. Instead, I was treated like a child until I raised my performance level, and was micro-managed for over a year, until laid off in December, 2020.\r\nNew upper management have raised several concerns and started workstreams/workgroups that will hopefully add some light at the end of the tunnel, however, it is a little too late for abuses that have already occurred and mindsets already set in stone. Despite the major abuses already discovered (2015 customer account abuses and subsequent regulation changes, 2009 Network Engineer burnout lawsuit, others), similar abuses still continue today due to the legacy Wells Fargo mindset to force employees to work until they burnout and leave, or are displaced at or above age 50. There are a few good managers, and most of the employees are awesome to work with, however, many have left or been pushed out due to lack of following with the marching orders.\r\nThere are no real career paths laid out, unless you want to become a political manager and move up the management chain of command. I and many others have suffered under this regime, and I have had little to no ability to move into the career path I really wanted. There was no time because I gave all of my energy and time to my day job, I was not given the opportunity to learn skills to move into the career I wanted to (no solid training courses or programs), and again, no tangible support from managers to help employees to grow.\r\nSome of the new strategies from executive management are good, but several do not make sense for a majority of the technical staff, such as the migration to BYOD. Such strategies make sense for securing Wells Fargo assets, however, leave the employees out to fend for themselves. What about employees who cannot afford the necessary technology to perform their job? What about employees with little knowledge or ability to secure their home network?\r\nCorporate technology that was paid for by Wells Fargo is increasingly watched and bogged down with security software to restrict and log every possible function, even if it is required by the job function or duties. Even my assigned MacBook Pro would turn the fan up and max out on resources on its own, or even crash the OS with no answers for many months."}, {"review_title": "It is what it is", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 May 2021", "job_title": "Research/Remediation Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits package is really good here.", "cons": "The company is navigating through some troubled times in the financial world and trying to adjust to the online digital age which is causing some growing pains amongst their customer base."}, {"review_title": "Better place to work in 2023 or beyond", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "31 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Vice President Marketing in Charlotte, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some divisions are really well run; competitive benefits versus other large companies, improving minority, diversity, equality policies and actions", "cons": "No career path or plan.

The tools we need are often broken, unreliable, poorly-supported, discontinued without warning, denied to us by access restrictions, or simply nonexistent.\r\n\r\nSome examples: our Zoom accounts (which we used for meetings, collaboration, pair programming, etc.) were recently all revoked with little warning, forcing us to fall back to Skype, which is notoriously buggy for Mac users. Our primary chat program is expected to be discontinued at some point, possibly without a replacement in place. Some, but not all, of our team members were added to the pilot for the intended replacement, making it useless for team communication. The central tool used to track issues and servers is a Mount Everest of cruft, a 20-year-old nightmare of input boxes and tabs and forms and subforms and confusing field names with no API access and a needlessly frustrating and time-consuming process of jumping through hoops to simply get access to it (even though it's required). One senior engineer somehow got tickets assigned to him in it even though he didn't have access to view them, and he never ended up getting it before changing jobs.\r\n\r\nSimply establishing a common development environment is a challenge; some of us have Windows computers while others have Macs, and not everyone has been able to get the same permissions. The end result is that everyone's development environment is more or less unique to them, built more on hacks than on common, automated processes. Sharing work is difficult when only a few people have been able to follow the byzantine process to get access to an antiquated tool. Well-intended regulatory pressure gets muddled up like a game of Telephone to the point where its impact on the ground often does more harm than good. For example, for the sake of \"security\" my work laptop is so locked down in terms of what I can install on it that I have been unable to get a password manager, and am forced to store my passwords in a plain text file. I put in a request to have one approved for MacOS In May 2019 (19 months ago), and still haven't seen seen results. This seems like a fitting example of what my time at Wells Fargo has been like: hoping for a much-needed glimpse of sanity that never seems to come."}, {"review_title": "Not a very hard job, Just customer service.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "27 May 2021", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunity for a new job or career to move up in.", "cons": "Does not pay that well considering responsibilities."}, {"review_title": "Wells Fargo", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "2 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Premier Banker in Pasadena, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A lot of locations in California", "cons": "Not able to utilize certificates such as CFP when you are a banker."}, {"review_title": "Good Company For Growth and Development", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Montessori Teacher in RajajiNagar", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly working environment and place for growth in career", "cons": "The hikes are given in low percentage"}, {"review_title": "Analyst", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "10 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome Company, Great Culture, Work Life Balance", "cons": "I cannot think of Any"}, {"review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer Senior Analyst in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good environment to work and take challenges", "cons": "Internal job portal postings are not accurate"}, {"review_title": "Good benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Teller in Laredo, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Easy job great staff and schedule", "cons": "Sometimes its slow and days are long"}, {"review_title": "Teller review", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Teller in San Antonio, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits, training, and flexible schedule", "cons": "Too focused on sales and little room to move up"}], [{"review_title": "Wells Fargo", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Investment Associate in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people, great culture, good benefits.", "cons": "Typical cons associated with a large institution."}, {"review_title": "SiteScope Salary", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Analyst in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good for package and good hikes", "cons": "Routine work, doing the same routine work"}, {"review_title": "It was OKAY", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They paid well in every area", "cons": "They will fire you at any time"}, {"review_title": "Good starting point", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Senior Financial Analyst in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Paid time off, pay, training", "cons": "Everything else.
