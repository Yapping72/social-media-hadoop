At the start, this wasn't too bad but now it appears platform teams are being thrown anything & everything that other teams don't like doing/want to do which is leading to insane amounts of work for platform who have limited human capital to handle all of these tasks efficiently. Example: There's a group who handles switching datacenters in the event of emergency but they didn't want to do it anymore & suddenly platform handles it now, with little-to-no training beforehand. \n-Work/life balance has all but vanished making working on a platform team a miserable experience for anyone.\n-Additionally, some of management are relatively new (1yr or less) & micro-manage their employees. \n-It appears there's discrimination in the form of some managers going the extra mile in making life easier for off-shore counterparts while forcing their on-shore reports to handle off-shore responsibilities (which off-shore has handled for years prior to the transformation). For example: Wells uses off-shore colleagues for business continuity, thus they begin work during the on-shore evenings, working until the on-shore afternoon the next day. During their hours, they handle all work until the on-shore colleagues return in the morning. However, management is forcing/requiring on-shore to log-on in the evenings during off-shore hours to handle deployments that are off-shore responsibility. This is also contributing to loss of work/life balance.\n-The company passes business continuity & their related exercises to teammates on platform teams, titling those handling the responsibilities as BRCs & BRMS (overseeing the BRCs completion of the exercises). Platform team leadership is wanting to pass these responsibilities to just a select few BRCs, responsible for possibly 10, 20, or 30+ applications which involves a lot of intricate , time-consuming tasks. This wouldn't be as bad if this is all the BRCs had to do was this but a majority are a part of platform teams who handle the on-shore support responsibly as well. Again, contributing to loss of work/life balance.\n-Training is lacking, it barely exists. Most of the people on these dev/platform teams were moved to their current teams & have little knowledge of the applications they now support. Additional applications keep getting moved to different teams with no knowledge & very limited training beforehand."}, {"review_title": "Ok place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Insurance is really really good", "cons": "Command and control management is a pain"}, {"review_title": "Wells", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Teller in Scottsdale, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Many different lines a business", "cons": "Hard to promote, inconsistent schedules, limited growth opportunities"}, {"review_title": "Good workplace experience.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Executive Office Information Request", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly and flexible management style.

I got called into frequent meetings where I was chewed out for things outside of my control up until I was terminated, funny how this didn't seem to be a problem with a manager I had had before hand. Scheduling any kind of pto is an absolute joke as the company refuses to staff their phone lines sufficiently, I was told to schedule pto in the middle of the week to avoid that problem, but my schedule had me working weekends so that wasn't even an option. Also communication is incredibly poor, we made changes to a product in the first half of 2022 and communication about that change was only sent to customers, not employees, so we were expected to answer questions that we were not given answers to. There was also a situation with trust accounts (which there was a dedicated department for) that we were told to resolve instead of transferring, we were not given the tools or knowledge to resolve said issues. Return to office plans were also poorly executed, its understandable that things were unpredictable during the height of the pandemic, but I wasn't aware what specific day I was supposed to return to the office until a week before that day.
