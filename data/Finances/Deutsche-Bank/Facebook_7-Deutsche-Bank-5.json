Sure we all have times when we have to stay late, or even want to stay to finish off that project or meet that deadline. But here people consciously stay at their desks and chat, go on facebook, make personal calls etc, until 8-9pm, then make a show of sighing and leaving, and come in the next morning (often around 10am due to their 'late night') and tell everyone how they never left until 9pm. And they actually gain promotion on the basis of this!! \r\n\r\n- constantly driving down costs and reducing teams who do all the work, resulting in teams of 1 or 2 running entire regions, all the while keeping multiple layers of management. As an example, you can have 2 people reporting to a VP, reporting to another VP, reporting to a D, reporting to another D, reporting to an MD, reporting to another MD before you advance to any real level in the company. The amount of money being saved is completely negated by a completely unnecessary hierarchy\r\n\r\n- completely sexist - no women advance in this area unless they 'look good'. Those who don't have to work hard but never advance\r\n\r\n- advancement based on friendships and contacts rather than achievement and potential\r\n\r\n- no clear focus of where they are headed - the same projects and improvements cycle every few years justifying projects and looking to change and improve standards with no real intention to do so\r\n\r\n- offices falling apart and drive towards 'clear desk policy' whereby all staff work on a stark white open desk with no privacy walls, and have to put all desk and personal items in a locker (no pedastals allowed under desks) result in offices with all the charm and personality of a hospital\r\n\r\n- the lowest morale of any company I have worked in (over 20 years City/finance experience)\r\n\r\n- the new CEOs came on board with the amazing idea of reducing Infrastructure by 60%. I know they're not sexy like the traders, but they keep the rest of you running! Don't forget that! \r\n\r\n- more of an opinion this one, but every single person I encounter where the subject of DB comes up has some sort of bad story - \"I know someone who worked there who had a nervous breakdown\", \"aren't they a terrible company to work for\", \"I've heard they're bad\". Now as I say, this is opinion, but I've never had this for any other place I've worked, and as mentioned above I have 20+ yrs of corporations\r\n\r\nAnd this is all that immediately comes to mind.

You can personally save the bank hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and you'll be lucky to receive a 3% raise at the end of the year. 3% of 33k is garbage.

Most of the power controls are in London and NY and they have vested interests in not letting Cary grow. Someone with good potential is targeted, mistreated, given worthless work and eventually forced to quit by exercising their political might. Most of the management (Directors & VPs) are undeserving loyalist who are only rubber stamps, taking orders from their bosses in NY or London and in return they survive the job (and even get promoted). This is helped by the HB2 hiring freeze and the bank's cost cutting measures which limited the growth in Cary. The technical architects (most of them controlling from London & NY) are highly incapable to even designing basic systems but are given a free hand because of their proximity to those who matter at the cost of quality. You can even find vendors architects & managers dominating and mistreating FTEs only because of support they hold from the powerful. Most of the applications in the bank are outdated and badly designed to handle today's needs. The HR and the senior management is well aware of this but has done nothing except for mentioning it in a couple of town halls & interact sessions. On the contrary, starting last year, even the authority of deciding the recognition award & promotion candidates in Cary was given to London & NY panels. This was a final nail in the coffin for Cary's sovereignty to retain good talent and do what is good for them.\r\nTo conclude, the overall atmosphere in the bank is highly political and counterproductive where talented new joiners will only add to a mass of frustrated zombies found everywhere throughout the centre now-a-days."}, {"review_title": "Deutsche Bank London", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 May 2017", "job_title": " in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Collaborative and innovative culture is conducive to development.

The bank is going through a strange transformation. They are confused about everything. Last year they paid bonuses to traders and then let them go. This year again the CEO is the second best paid banking CEO and employees continue to suffer. Minimalistic hikes for people. There is a 4 % group variable that too is never paid in full. Seniors have some variable component.\r\n2. Your onshore boss is too worried about his job. He'll do whatever he's asked to do. The focus is only on cost cutting. Nothing else. There is no strategy. They did this last year now their revenues are shaky. Most of the lunch conversation is around who left or has been asked to leave. India is possibly better off though but there have been cuts which are all hush hush. Some percentage of the population is asked to look for a new role or leave without any good reason.\r\n3. There are no backfills. They say they've improved processes and the IT looks better now so there is no need to hire. The truth of the matter is they never did a lot of investment on IT or process improvement, they don't have the money. The result is teams as big as a couple of dozens reduced to a half a dozen people. Your boss tells you that \" you should be happy you have a job\". Poor chap also clocked in the same time as me. No one is safe. \r\n4. The HR is useless. I just see them in the canteen. They should speak to the employees more often. Especially in a situation like this when they are withdrawing cab facilities and LnD budgets. I don't remember if I know who my HRBP was. This was specially required to alleviate fears when the Deutsche commerzbank merger news started coming out. With Deutsche bank you should always believe in rumors. Don't believe any of their official communication. Employees value stability, atleast HR can attempt to comfort them in this regard.\r\n5. The overall atmosphere is very depressing. Career development is the last thing anyone wants. They sell all problems as opportunities which is a good way too stretch your people. But there is no growth in any form.. Monetary or hierarchical. People were promoted this year, but it was a retention policy for older poorly paid employees as they'd announced no bonuses again. A lot of good employees lost in the bargain. These people are on the look out now, something DB should curb.\r\n6. India barring Mumbai CIB centre is a  back/middle office for DB. Their IT ops are also based out of these places.

I worked in Business Finance so I can\u2019t speak for other areas, but it was far and away the most toxic, unprofessional work environment I have ever been a part of. Most people who work in the department look and act miserable day in and day out. People openly yell and use profanity in frustration all day long in a very open concept workspace (and the frustration is understandable). Data quality and IT infrastructure are a complete joke. A huge part of your job in Finance is attempting to resolve millions of dollars worth of system breaks. And by system breaks, I mean variances between subsystems and the ledger that you can\u2019t figure out because it\u2019s next to impossible to research. I\u2019m not entirely sure how this place passes audit to be honest. It\u2019s a very unstable job because they\u2019re always trying to cut costs and headcount. There were numerous times in my time there where entire teams were done away with or the roles were offshored to India. In fact, since I\u2019ve left I\u2019ve heard the Business Finance function as a whole is migrating to India. And then they expect you to go over there for months to train the people taking your job. Turnover is extremely high, with entire teams including managers turning over within a year or 2. Many people left to go to the other investment bank downtown. If you decide to leave, it\u2019s likely you will get the cold shoulder (and sometimes open hostility) from your manager and directors the rest of your time there. If you try to move to another team, your current manager will often block you moving no matter how unhappy you are so you can\u2019t take another role. I saw people I worked with quit without a job lined up yet because they couldn\u2019t take it anymore.  Promotions are hard to get because of how political the process is and how much it relies on you having significant interaction with NY.
