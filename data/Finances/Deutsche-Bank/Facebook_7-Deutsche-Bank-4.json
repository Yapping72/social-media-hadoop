They talk about \"expert path\" for technical people which doesn't exist, at least not in Cary.  You will have no autonomy as all the decisions are made in London and NY.  Your senior manager is put in place by those same teams nervous about hiring outside of the hubs, so his job is just to work you until you quit and not to make any noise such as picking good software or practices.  Your failure provides them cover to not transfer jobs from their location.  They have never promoted anyone in Cary to a senior position- the last three directors weren't even from other Deutsche Bank locations; they went outside the company instead of promote one of the more than 100 existing managers or senior developers.  There is a serious flight of talent- other companies are easily able to poach people who are competent, able to work under pressure, and worth every penny of their salary.  Speaking of which, you used to get a bonus for all the downsides mentioned above.  No more.   It depends on the performance of the company  to get a maximum of 4%.  Take a look at the stock and you'll see how unlikely that is.    Diversity is overdone- protected groups can't be fired, and no one cares to take the time to hire good talent, they just want to have bodies to fill their hiring quotas.  The center head stood up in front of the employees at a town hall and said he's going to hire 50% women. What happened to equal opportunity hiring?

Which is what you'll do for several hours a week- mandatory training classes for financial stuff which you'll never use as a developer but bureaucracy rules.  The HR team is horrible- they live in a little private area, through a card-key door, so you can't interact with them.  If you ask them a question, they'll reply with \"call the hotline'.  Everyone desk is a 'trading desk', meaning they've crammed people into huge open areas with the same double-monitor and phone on the side of the desks with employees 5-wide and back to back.  Even call centers have more room.  They've got 800+ people in one building that other residents of the office park have closer to 300 in theirs.

Fairly lax management who allows you to take the reigns without too much micromanagement.

People are generally jaded due to low P&L generation as well as less deal flow due to DB's recent reputation on the Street. Because of the aforementioned factors, DB is losing out on young talent rapidly because they are unable to compete with comparable offers other investment banks are giving to those who have decided to jump ship. Moreover, recruiters are actively reaching out to and poaching Deutsche employees due to the current state of the place. It's sad because in its hey-day, DB was probably one of the top European investment banks to work for and now everyone talks about it as though its a modern day Titanic. \r\n\r\nSenior managers are also being pushed out due to being too expensive. Even those higher-ups who do generate P&L have been let go because Deutsche simply cannot afford to keep them on payroll. Cost-cutting is the name of the game and it has sadly made for a very angry and frustrating work environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, Deutsche's infrastructure is so broken and bureaucratic it makes it virtually impossible for front office to generate new business. If a counterparty wants to set up a subaccount to trade a certain product with DB, the process takes weeks when it should only take 10 minutes. If an entirely new client wants to trade with us, forget it... that process can take months. Sometimes, by the time an account gets up and running to trade, the client is so disenchanted with our disorganized onboarding process that they decide the hassle isn't worth it.\r\n\r\nOverall, I gained a lot of knowledge during my three years at DB. It was honestly an awesome place to start a career and build a decent nest egg, but if you're looking for A-grade comp at an uber competitive investment bank, look elsewhere as DB will only provide you with enough to get by and the place itself isn't terribly competitive because they can't afford to be."}, {"review_title": "Too much drama", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Sept 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Hard work is noticed and rewarded sometimes however that depends on manager and luck.\r\nSome smart and dedicated people but they are in the minority.\r\nGood experience, exposure to interesting deals, and other teams.\r\n35 hour work week, good annual leave, possibility to work from home", "cons": "Favouritism, preferential treatment, cliquey.\r\nBackstabbing, rumours and slander are tolerated.

Some teams have dress down Friday, giving a sense of work-life balance.\r\n8. Some very proactive initiatives and senior managers widely championing such programmes.", "cons": "1. DBOI contracts not as good as AG contracts yet judged to the same standard.\r\n2. Toxic culture, often easy to get shunted into doing mundane work with little direction or in some cases interaction. Can easily bend over backwards and gain little recognition from some seniors. \u2018Sink or swim\u2019 culture where there is often more work than resources and questionable as to who is really benefiting from this way of working.\r\n3. Very hierarchical and political. Some take titles and politics way too far over what wider value they\u2019re creating for the teams they\u2019re managing and their surrounding colleagues.\r\n4. Technology and processes are poor compared to other companies within the financial industry.\r\n5. Promotions feel like who you know rather than what you know and often a popularity contest. If you don\u2019t fit in you\u2019ll notice very quickly and in some cases won\u2019t get a lot of support. A lot of sucking up to senior managers goes on and individuals being prepared to stamp on others to get noticed by seniors, such as snitching and blame culture. Local line managers often left to their own devices which means junior employees struggle to progress. Creates a very toxic environment. Certain personalities dominate and often get the final say on everything.\r\n6. Very hard to climb the ranks, especially if you\u2019re junior and in with a manager who is going to take a lot of persuading that you\u2019re worth it.\r\n7. Flexible working is highly promoted but executed poorly, at the discretion of the line manager which makes the policy very unfair. Rigid 40-hour 9am-6pm week for DBOI contracts from a bygone era with little flexibility around this. An expectation to do overtime whenever required and the ability to only claim in lieu with no financial compensation offered. Some teams have strict rules on when holiday can and can't be used.\r\n8. Some HR staff need serious retraining, some come across as cold, not terribly people-centric and very defensive.\r\n9. Some senior management who get into powerful positions risks becoming blind to the everyday struggles that go on in the front line, including people resigning. There is a \u2018management stick together\u2019 culture where some local AVP, VP or D managers are too quick to go on the defensive against their own, their favourites or their seniors which means especially if you\u2019re junior, you will struggle to get listened to even if your argument is perfectly reasonable or at least warrants some concern."}], [{"review_title": "think before you bank", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great colleagues, very helpful to new staff, very good facilites, up to date IT, some management very approachable interesting work", "cons": "long long hours, insufficient support, knee jerk reports produce bad decisions, little time given over to thinking how this could be a more fun place to work unlike the top 75 companies who make it their business to care for their employees, hot desking a disaster"}, {"review_title": "a melting pot to work in", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Apr 2012", "job_title": " in City of London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Its a tech friendly place to work in.

The company is trying to reform their IT infrastructure, but as an industry leading \"abuser\" of outsourcing, it's once again outsourcing away its IT problems by creating IT centers in places where it is not known for IT. \r\nIT is just an epitome of where DB's BO/MO currently stands at. Every function is intertwined with outsourcing and core locations, and there is no accountability for quality and consistency in the process. Instead of trying to gain efficiency from where the work really happens, DB just allocates work to places where it shouldn't mainly for cost reasons. This makes the structure more complicated and more bloated, and therefore, more costly. Also, even those functions that are seen as \"grunt works\" have their value, and by outsourcing away those functions, it loses a positive feedback loop. For example, juniors in NY or elsewhere won't be equipped with necessary skills or knowledge to perform their jobs as they should. In essence, too much compartmentalization and slicing and dicing of functions are becoming a new religion managers are worshiping these days at the bank. This will make them look busy and have achieved something, and thereby even enabling them to become MDs, but this doesn't benefit anybody in the end. \r\nThere are also so many middle managers (i.e., AVP to directors) in the process who just sit idly by the problems until they are forced to fix the problems. There are many good guys, but there are contemptible managers who just want to keep their jobs. \r\nFinally, just to offer my 2 cents on their geographic focus, I think the bank's direction is dead wrong. The bank's \"firm\" commitment in certain European regions is just digging a deeper hole to its problem.

Constant reorgs trying to figure out how to fix the myriad of issues yet they only serve to give certain people promotions while the others suffer and are left confused as to who they report to. At the end of the day you just have MORE bosses. Toxic work environment where the managers won't even talk to you or acknowledge your existence unless you quit, then they get upset because once again they have to go through the painful round of hiring a candidate which due to company bureaucracy takes between 3-4 months. If you are applying here don't give notice until just before your start date or you could go without a paycheck for months. A lot of people just quit the department to go to a competitor in town BEFORE bonuses were even paid out, that speaks for the desperation to leave and the sub par quality of bonuses. There is zero recognition for hard/above and beyond work because either your manager will take credit or simply no one cares. Once again only those favorites will get a promotion. Complete mismatch between companies stated values and actual quality of work. The department also makes the foolish mistake of only having one person trained on a unique role so that if you decide to move internally you will be stuck training your replacement for months on end, or if you quit they beg you to train your external replacement, who won't start for months.....Maybe other departments are okay to work for but certainly not product control or whatever they decided to name themselves today. If you are a manager elsewhere looking to hire a DB employee don't look down on the fact that someone here hasn't been promoted, chances are they deserved to be many times over, DB just doesn't promote promotions....
