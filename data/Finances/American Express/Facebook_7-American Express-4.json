Lack of governance and controls that creates audit issues.  Due to this being a technology center with most managers being promoted based on technical abilities instead of leadership and/or management ability, the is little attention given to performance development let alone completing goals and performance reviews in a timely or consistent manner.  Finally, a significant amount of those being hired and/or promoted at the Desert Ridge technology center is race based - if you are Indian (from India, not native American Indian) then you are automatically pre-qualified.  98% of the newer Big Data technology hires are Indian.  Internal company nickname is Indian Express instead of American Express.  This is no joke...  Finally, there is a significant number of contract workers that are treated as outsiders when it comes to communication and recognition for accomplishments.

Yay for us women holistically, but from the inside perspective it's not as diverse as one would think. Fair warning, this will be very direct. White women at this company simply love hiring other white women. Looking at some of the micro-organizations here, it's as if they are arming themselves against diversity in thought. Make no mistake, there are heaps of ethnic backgrounds at Amex, but  the majority will be found in the bottom half.  To use myself as an example, I've been honored with the highest year-end rating possible, have the support and confidence of layers of senior leadership and I've been up for a promotion for nearly 9 months. I've been on 8 total  interviews in the past year, studied rigorously for each,  and have been succeeded by a white woman each time  (I wish this was an exaggeration.) Not to mention that each of these jobs  were interviewed  exclusively by white women. It's more than a coincidence. I won't hold this singular observation accountable for my personal experience, but I would urge the leadership of this company to expand their ideals about the eligibility, skill, and intellect of those who aren't a married or engaged young white woman.
