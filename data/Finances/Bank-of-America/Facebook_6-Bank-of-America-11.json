Bogus answer to pass it on to someone else instead of helping their employees improve and get better. Base pay has been announced to increase, but for new employees. Current employees do not see that benefit. Incentive bonuses continuously change and it has become almost impossible for some markets to even come remotely close to hit them.

They laid off part of my team and then hired more people than we lost only 8 months later.  Senior management also likes to change things up a lot, which is annoying because nobody can remember what their actual job title is, or the newest procedures they are supposed to follow.  This isn't helped by the fact that their idea of communicating these things is to send out a blast email about it, or have a quick training about it where the trainer basically knows as much as you do."}, {"review_title": "BIttersweet", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Jun 2013", "job_title": "Teller in Daytona Beach, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You can move up within the company fairly quickly with the right set of skills and a good work ethic.

Branch consistency, some managers sit on their butts and aren't willing to help the customers or fellow employees when its busy. There seems to be a high ratio of women as branch and assistant managers which I find somewhat odd.The company says they are a leader but they actually seem to be following banks like Chase when it comes to implementing new technology. Work/life balance stinks, they expect it to be your only priority. Part-timers have a hard time holding onto a 2nd job elsewhere because the bank prefers you only work for them. Cutting of positions at branches. I see the personal banker position being phased out in favor of the much lower paying and more demanding sales & service specialist position. Assistant branch manager positions and TOS (teller operation specialist) positions are also being cut in some banking centers. Full-time teller positions are going bye-bye.  Pay for certain positions is lacking."}, {"review_title": "Good benefits, salary, opportunities; High Stress, Retail, 6 days a week", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Jul 2014", "job_title": "Banking Center Manager II in Summit, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and salary.

Sales goals can be fMost employees in retail work 6 days a week and if you're an exempt employee and wish to take a half day in the middle of the week to make up for working the saturday you must use leave which seems like a bush league move for a big bank that expects a lot from its managers.  Overall I would say BofA is not bad and will help pay the bills and get you going in banking if you're motivated and self starting but there are a lot better jobs in banking out there (small banks are probably best, big banks seem to be all the same) and if you can find one of those you should take it."}, {"review_title": "its ok", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Teller", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "pay is good and hours too", "cons": "management is unreliable and had favoritism"}], [{"review_title": "Great Atmosphere", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative (CSR) in Charlotte, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work with friends", "cons": "The customers are rude sometimes"}, {"review_title": "Great Bank", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Small Business Consultant in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of help and people wanting to help out.
