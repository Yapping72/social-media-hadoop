Specifically that i was guaranteed no more than 2 Saturday shifts per month when hired. For the first year I got 1 Saturday off every otheronth. Then at 1 point so many people were leaving that BofA told us (about 5 branches) they needed everyone to be \"team players\" and give up days off so branches could stay open 6 days per week.
