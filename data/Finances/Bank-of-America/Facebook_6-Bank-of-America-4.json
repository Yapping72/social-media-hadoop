Branch can have no toilet & they tell you you will have to drive across the street to go at the grocery store. Told management there was a strong smell of propane/gas in a back closed door room (that we used all day and had to keep the door closed while we were using it and the bank is open for business ), for a year and a half, only to find out later after something else needed fixing that there were not 1 but 2 gas leaks. Asked a manager one time if I could go pump as a nursing mother with a newborn at home & was told I had to wait quite some time (Even though there was plenty of staff coverage for me to use my required lunch break to do this), while I was in pain and about to leak through my shirt. Employees that were a known close contact & in the presence of another positive employee, are not required to submit a negative test upon return to the branch and only needed to take 2 -3 days off. At the beginning of the pandemic the bank allowed people who were \u201chigh risk\u201d or had \u201chigh risk\u201d family to stay at home getting paid for doing nothing, then were trained to work in the call center department from home, while the rest of us (including people with high risk family who didn\u2019t know they could call and work from home), were torn from our home branches and forced to drive all over the place so far from home in branches so crowded with angry customers there was no way to socially distance anywhere. This was under the guise that we would be going back to our branch however now they\u2019ve started closing them permanently and not working with the employees to find them a place closer to home or they shuffle people even further away without asking. We are forced to wear bank provided masks (that are not KN95 which are supposed to be the most effective). The bank slogan of \u201cwe\u2019re better when we\u2019re connected\u201d is a sham. There has never been more disconnect between employees and management and employee relations than there is now. Given the current worldly events, this is extremely disheartening. This bank does not care about employees even the employees who have put in so many years of their life, dedication and talents and spent so many hours away from their families commuting to and fro.

Biggest risk is breaching compliance e.g. not completing your training on time (that is VERY serious). Managers just need to clap like seals when senior managers talk & they are set. If they can write fancy emails and cc mgmt that is even better. \n\n-Pay is good relative to the amount of effort you put in (close to zero)\n\n-Good entertainment perks e.g. Dinner budgets", "cons": "- Most managers won't teach you anything. Mgmt's KPI is how well they can delegate work to subordinates. Most have 0 idea about the business they are running, but rely on competent subordinates to do the job. Most subordinates will eventually leave, except those who are trapped on 500K salaries but contribute very little. \n\n-Bonus is one of the lowest on the street. Unless you're the CEO making 23 million dollars & taking a private jet from Charlotte to Boston every week. Don't expect to be paid well (esp in Equities) & your bonus is not very well correlated to your output (which is intentionally kept very vague). \n\n-Feels more like a charity than a bank that cares about profits. I understand the importance of diversity/inclusion, but it is done a bit excessively here. E.g. Internal seminars that teach you how to interact with LGBT.....\n\n- The bank actively disencourages innovation. Obviously, they don't put it like this, but try to suggest new ideas & it will likely die in layers of bureaucracy after your request is forwarded through three different continents. Most technology applications & popular websites are blocked, and most tech teams will either not respond or come back to you weeks later. It helps to have a boss who has sway in the bank & can help you get resources, so if you don't.... then too bad. \n\n-Onboarding clients is a pain. The amount of documents required by the team is often painful for clients, and clients who want to do business with us are often turned away for random reasons such as 'Lacking potential'. These decisions are often made by people in the team who can't tell the difference between alpha & beta.\n\n-Everyone good is gone. There was once a time when there were still good people in the division. I define good as people who know clients well & have a good sense of the market. Those have mostly gone either to the buyside or moved to other houses. This means that the people you are left with cannot teach you anything that will make you useful to clients. \n\nThere are so many more but these are specific to this bank and specific to a division and specific to a region."}, {"review_title": "Renumeration", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Project Manager in Bromley, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work environment and people.", "cons": "Low salary growth and bonuses."}, {"review_title": "Business and Consumer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "18 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Relationship Manager Business Owner Specialist in Mount Laurel, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for.
