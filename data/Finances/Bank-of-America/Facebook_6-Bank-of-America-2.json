You can get decent benefits for little stress and effort. This is a good place to coast.\r\n\r\nBank of America (often referred to as \"the Bank\") is a huge, world-wide company with more than 200K employees. They have and do just about everything, so you should try to filter by roles and locations to get a better sense of what's going on if you're considering a role here.\r\n\r\nThis review is specific to my time as a Python back-office developer in the FX space in Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are pretty good and they offer just about every benefit you could imagine. Insurance costs were on the higher end compared to other places I've worked. 401k match is 5% with a bonus 2% (this bonus portion vests over some years). Paternity/maternity leave is great at 4 months paid, with the option to take another 2 months unpaid. 20 days PTO with 10 sick days plus Bank holidays and you can carry some days into the next year, so fairly generous time off.\r\n\r\nThe Quartz platform can be a pro or con, depending on how you look at it. Quartz is a custom and proprietary set of Python modules and tools. Some of it is really cool and advanced. For example, the Quartz has its own object DB, job scheduler, distributed computing, and UI tools which are all home-grown by the Bank. There are some very smart and talented technologists here.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago group I worked with was pretty fun and laid back. Work wasn't very stressful at all. World-wide support teams eliminated the need for being on-call during nights and weekends.\r\n\r\nThe Bank embraces agile and cross-functional teams. There's not a lot of project managers and the team manager gets very involved in the work-flow and development cycle which is nice. Your boss usually has a very good understanding of what's going on in the trenches.\r\n\r\nHiring process is very quick or can be for some teams. I only had a phone screen and a few hours of in person interviewing before I got an offer.\r\n\r\nGood amount of internal mobility options. A lot of people at the Bank have been there a long time. You may be a little limited by location as certain cities support certain functions (this was pre-covid).\r\n\r\nContractors get treated like employees for the most part.\r\n\r\nSome benefits have earnings limit levels or are available below certain amounts. So if you're hourly, you likely some additional benefits compared to salaried employees. One example I remember was for getting a daycare allowance.", "cons": "Pay is very average if not below market and yearly cost of living raises are around 1-1.5%. If you want a raise, you need to threaten to quit and bring in an offer letter. My first boss and boss's boss tried to get me a merit increase for months that was never approved. The day I resigned, the first thing my last boss said was \"I can match any offer\". Bonus is around 5-6%.\r\n\r\nLay-offs happen all the time, all over the Bank. Every position is funded by year. During the Trump tax cuts, the CEO told the entire company in an earnings call the Bank has never had so much money and everyone was getting an additional $1K bonus and hundreds of millions above plan would be invested in technology. A few months later, my dept cut about 40% of headcount. Contractors are first to be let go. \r\n\r\nNot all of Quartz is great. There are known issues and bugs. It's been around a long time and changed hands. You get the feeling there is fatigue in investing into the platform. And some things are just plain ridiculous to roll your own version of: IDE, messaging system, source control, release management. You can get good job security by mastering the Quartz environment because it is in so many applications, but that only makes you more valuable to the Bank and less marketable elsewhere over time.\r\n\r\nYou're pretty much just a number. The Bank has so many people and levels of management you really never see anyone above your boss' boss. And because the teams are agile and app-based you never really work with more than a few teams who interact with your application. You feel and are treated like a drop in the bucket. Make sure you have good rapport with your direct manager and co-workers or you can be miserable.\r\n\r\nAlso, because there's so many people and upper management have so many levels, the day-to-day working conditions really get controlled by your direct manager. For example, our boss didn't want us working from home (pre-covid) more than 2 days per month and even then he said he was being generous and going against company policy. A different team on our floor had scheduled work from home days every week for the whole team.\r\n\r\nOffice amenities were awful at the Field Building in Chicago, but the Bank has moved everyone out of that building. There wasn't very much in terms of company-sponsored lunches or parties or anything like that. Probably the least amount of money spent on extras for employees I've ever seen.\r\n\r\nThere is no training or conference budget. Any training you get from the Bank will be assigned to you.\r\n\r\nBecause the Bank hires so many people, so quickly, there are a fair amount of duds that get brought in. We had multiple contractors start without interviewing them; they were just assigned to our team when certain efforts started.

It boasts about its donations to racial inequality and women entrepreneurs, but they should really spend that money on themselves first. I worked on 3 tech teams and 2 finance teams, and I was frequently the only woman on the team. Every woman on all of those teams has since left. Furthermore, the teams were entirely Caucasian and Asian. This is not diversity.\r\n\r\n2) Creepy coworkers: Coming from tech, being one of a few women was not unusual. At BofA, it was a different vibe. I was constantly targeted by middle-aged men and frequently asked inappropriate questions about my dating life, my child-rearing abilities, and my menstrual cycle. Yes, you read that right. I took 2-3 days off a few times to visit a sick relative in nearby state, and a colleague asked if I was out because of my period. Despite reporting this, the same creepy questioning continued. \r\n\r\n3) Bad managers: While I did have 2 decent managers, the rest were comically bad. One jokingly called me his secretary and would assign admin tasks like making a holiday video for the team, then was shocked when I left for a much more technical role. The other was a micromanager with a total lack of empathy and who was unable to give clear instructions, and would yell at the top of his lungs. When I reported this to the head of the department, he claimed that it was difficult to fire someone. After 5 others reported him and eventually left, then they finally had a talk with him. He is still there.\r\n\r\n4) Outdated technology: Systems are so old and there is lost knowledge from all the turnover. Most applications look like they were built in the 90s and haven't been updated. You can't do your job because these systems are crashing and breaking, and hours are wasted waiting for data and calculations.

My manager at the time was very familiar with my situation and the struggles I was having and he recommended that I apply for the program. So after looking into further to make sure I met the eligibility requirements I applied and was approved. I was obviously relieved and thankful for that assistance but fast forwarding to about 8 months after the program ended I receive a call from a fraud investigator saying that I wasn't eligible to have ever participate in the program. She pretty much made it sound like I made up the existence of my niece and nephew just so that I could fraudulently collect money from them. Now since the day I was hired I've always had my niece and nephew listed as my beneficiaries in my employee benefits as well as I submitted copies of their birth certificates and immunization records to prove their existence wasn't something I made up.
