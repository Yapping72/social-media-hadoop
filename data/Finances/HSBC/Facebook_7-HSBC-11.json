These are often the suck-ups or the relatives of HSBC C-level execs or high value clients.  I can think of one key example of this, a manager I used to have.  This was a woman who types with two fingers, wears low cut shirts and cannot understand the most basic of processes.  She has prevented her own staff from promotions and new roles because she is too lazy to rehire.  She effectively shut down 20% of the team at HSBC Canada and now works in HR. She clearly favours promoting men over women.  She \"works from home\" all the time when we all knew she was just dropping off and picking up her daughter from school\r\n\r\nThis is just one small example of the nepotism and futility at this company.  As an employee, goals were unrealistic and there was extreme pressure day to day.  The convoluted, every changing corporate structure made it nearly impossible to be effective in your job.  Things changed constantly, and often half-baked.  Departments were merged and un-merged.  Local structures became global overnight, with many people reporting to managers in remote locations and forced to take 3am \"team\" conference calls.\r\n\r\nMy advice would be to run away from any job offer at HSBC. This is a sinking giant in an outdated industry. They only got e-mail transfer payments in 2015 for godsake!  The pay and bonuses are not worth the stress on yourself, your family and your health.

Specific examples provided to the bank by me were brushed under the carpet and disregarded. \r\nMisuse of authority - a great deal of bullying - instead of embracing the skills of individuals, managers with inferior skills will suppress the individual to avoid being exposed themselves.

You need to leave \"you\" at the door and act as the person they want you to be in this unnatural, contrived environment.\r\nFar, far too much politics with managers putting their own egos before what is beneficial to the company or the customer.

Their policy appears to be one where they will make life difficult and intolerable for longer serving staff so they leave and can be replaced by new (cheaper) staff. They do not value knowledge, experience, skills, innovation.  Don't get me wrong at interview they will test all of these, but they will knock any individuality out of you in the first 6 months.  They must have unreserved subservience. \"If you don't like the way we do things..... hard cheese.... Leave!\" this is their attitude. \r\nThe bank is unreceptive to feedback and arrogantly \"knows better\".\r\nI gave 3/4 of my working life to HSBC and feel stupid in that I have just realised how little they value you and I am horrified that they blatently do not even care that they do not value you.

Inefficient and frustrating.\r\nExcessive red tape and a \"can't do\" attitude amongst middle management.  \r\nA big vote up here for the brainwashing.  Every day you're told HSBC is \"The Best Place to Work\" - this slogan is plastered across foyers in letters 6 foot high.  And for years I believed it... TBH I started to believe there must be something wrong with me, always missed out on promotions, getting poor reviews, very undervalued.  Back at School, Uni and everywhere else I've worked I was always a high achiever, yet at HSBC I always felt like a ne'er do well.  Why?  Because line managers generally don't like people with ideas and initiative, they want Stepford Wives.  \r\n[BTW, HSBC is not \"The Best Place to Work\".  Back in the days when *all* staff completed the staff survey, we used to score 55%-60% staff satisfaction.  There are 100's of companies in the country with staff satisfaction ratings >90%.]\r\nBullying is rife.  Too many managers throwing their weight around.  Over 12 years I had 9 different line managers, I made complaints against 3.  Not only were my complaints not investigated, HR told me I would be placed on a disciplinary for gross misconduct if I didn't retract a formal grievance. In case you're thinking I'm the over-sensitive whiny type, one complaint was i.r.o. a physical assault, witnessed by numerous colleagues.  Nothing was done about it, no-one would back me up.  People didn't want to \"get involved\".\r\nMy opinion is that HSBC's anti-bullying policy is there for show, like a lot of their other policies.  e.g. I also suffered RSI whilst working at HSBC, they took 3 months to undertake a workstation assessment and refused to provide me with an ergonomic mouse - I had to buy my own.  \r\nMorale is low, so many staff I've seen in tears, even threatening suicide because they hate their jobs so much.\r\nPoor communication & secrecy at every level of management.  e.g. Time and time again staff have found out from BBC news that HSBC is making 1000 UK staff redundant, but there is zero internal communication about it.  Staff are left to worry and speculate, whispering in corners.\r\nRegarding IT systems - yes a lot are fairly stone-age.  HSBC overall tend to \"play it safe\", which is one of the reasons they didn't fall into the money market sinkhole back in 2007/2008, but it also means they choose to avoid being at \"the leading edge\" of anything, because the leading edge is often the bleeding edge.\r\nAlso ofc new things cost money: if you've not worked for a financial institution, please understand that everything is about money.

The behaviour and culture of the vast majority of the department staff was absolutely disgraceful and lacking in all integrity.\r\n\r\nThere was rampant bullying from a big group of complaints handlers who had worked for HSBC a long time and had moved into this department, 'to get the redundancy when PPI finishes.' These people singled out a few of the complaints handlers who they had arrogantly decided were 'weak.' They constantly loudly shouted out degrading insults and stereotypes on the office floor based on the appearance and personality of the victim, which created a very hostile work environment. If a complaint handler was quiet, the bullies would shout out that he had nothing to offer and was a drag on the place. If a complaint handler was slim/sporty in appearance, these people would shout that he was a horrible competitive person who is trying to be better than us. If a complaint handler was English like myself, these bullies constantly shouted out that he was coming in and doesn't know our how things work around here, even after I had been there a long time.\r\n\r\nThe worst thing that was shouted out on the office floor were the sexist comments. A group would target complaint handlers who they found attractive and shout out comments - often very positive - about their body/attractiveness. However, these comments were mixed with insults about that person's personality and even their appearance at the same time. So they thought they could have everything their own way with the person which is totally sexist. It's worth noting that men were just as often the target of this sexism as  women.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the managers were shockingly self-centred and self-serving in their behaviour. They, like the majority of the complaint handlers, lied and pretended that they did not know what was going on every day, whenever an incident of bullying was reported. This was part and parcel of the back-covering and lying culture of the company whereby people denied all knowledge of anything bad that happened, just in case it might put them out  in any way.

Months later I recieved another offer, with paperwork and advised I needed to go through vetting. \r\n\r\nAn entire month of 0 communication later, a 3rd party vetting company in London then demanded I signed a document giving them the right to demand ANY information they later request as well as ring up any of my previous employers and ask them ANYTHING, even non-emplpoyment related, which goes well outside the scope of what is reasonable. All of this, including seriously sensitive and private information I would never give to an employer, or anyone, was also expected to be sent to this stranger in London, who additionally,  I had no agreement under the GDPR to share or store any of this with, it would be going through personal email, completely unsecured. Interesting how HSBC allows this but wouldn't even allow us to login to our work emails from home because of customer's data protection.\r\n\r\nMy \"case\" was then allegedly referred to HSBC's legal department who advised the information I'd already provided was sufficient and I didn't need to communicate further with this 3rd party to get my start date and begin.\r\n\r\nOn breaks and lunches I heard nothing but trained staff talking about how miserable it was, they couldn't wait to leave, they were all applying elsewhere and it was awful.\r\n\r\nI'd also had some disgusting comments made about my disability by other staff members.\r\n\r\nWe were also told about all this support we'd receive and that we were going to be doing 1-2-1s with a manager every month to keep track of our wellbeing. My \"class\" completed the first one, I wrote about all of the above (paraphrased) and a manager whipped around the class, signed them all off and didn't bother to read them.\r\n\r\nMy dream job then offered me a position, so I handed my notice in and said I want to work (It would be a week on the phones so I'd be taking thousands of pounds of payments towards credit cards, at least 10 times daily what I'd be earning in a month working there) and I was told that I wasn't allowed to work my notice, wouldn't be getting paid notice pay, and that I needed to he escorted out of the building either then or at the end of the day. The two trainers we had, one of whom was communicating all of this, were lovely and incredibly knowledgable, and was just communicating what a manager, who wouldn't even look me in the eye, had told her.\r\n\r\nNow, weeks later, I haven't been paid, despite my ex-colleagues being paid on Saturday and contractually needing to be paid on Monday, because out of 1 of the 3 times I had to submit my bank details clearly wasn't enough for them to input it correctly. That's even if the payslip ive been sent, without a P45 which has been requested numerous times as well as my actual wage, is accurate and they have attempted to pay this money, which I'm starting to doubt is really the case. \r\n\r\nKnowing what I know about various goings on in this bank, I would never work for them again and never bank with them.

This seems to be common there with another joiner also having the same problem. Had I known how bad my line manager was I would never have taken the job and just stayed longer at my previous employer.  \nThe employee support is so bad, managers are not equipped or trained to deal with issues and don't care.  They are very old school and the management clique stick together, not interested in the very people they hire!\nAs usual, HR are useless.\n\nI.T:\nInfrastructure is so bad at HSBC, things take ages to get fixed and no I.T  person to come to help at your desk since they offshored 1st line support .  If you want something done you go and wait at the help desk for everything.\n\n\nOverall, there is only a very toxic environment with poorly managed processes and incompetent management at HSBC.  Employees are seen as nothing but a number and treated like cattle.  Certainly not the \"healthy human system\" a very disconnected CEO keeps shouting about."}, {"review_title": "A State of Flux", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "4 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Assistant Vice President in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Depending on the team, some people in the organization are a delight.
