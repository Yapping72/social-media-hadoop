For example, the branches\u2019 banking hours: 11am to 7pm(until 31 March 2023, new hours with effect of first of april) but we at the branch will close the issuance of queue tickets 1-3 hours earlier depending on the crowd of the day. But\u2026The hotline does not know this and relay the branches are still issuing Q Numbers until 7pm so customers assuming what they told were right would come down and say that the hotline say we are still issuing the Q Numbers until 7pm when we already stop the issuance. This causes a lot of problems when we, The Digital Ambassadors have to reject the customer and tell them to come back another day when the branch is still crowded after the stopping of q tickets.

Toxic workplace to start with. those back end staff will never teach you the proper way, they will scold you instead until they are happy. When you do things wrong, they will ask you to ask our seniors when our seniors are engaged. like should you be the one to be our mentor bcs this is technically what you are in charge for? not to mention the gossips behind you, they will gossip you until there is no link related to them jst bcs they want to make everyone hate you. validation seeking is very much on point here. basically is a company politics that every workplace would have. (I wont mention their names here, but i will remember these people as my motivation to go up from what yall have been doing for me all these time). 4. you have to get click with your manager and colleague, even if u hate it. if not, goodluck. it will be hard for you to seek for every little things for help. also, lucky if you get a good manager to work with, otherwise, just leave. 5. if you do well, you feel like you are the boss. if you are not, they will treat you like a garbage. but ofcoz those who performed well will still have to endure the scold and argue with the staff before you are well known for having good sales performance. 6. again this is demoralizing yourself. 7. you have to be people pleaser (maybe bcs of doing sales but what i mean by people pleaser is rlly next level). you have no choice but to go work during your off day, OT everday to call and assist customer demand. not to mention the paperwork given, you might be staying until 9pm everyday in which this is out from your contract agreement. 8. i have seen my peers who worked longer than me are struggling with mental health issue due to this, and the way they treat the financial consultant staff are really very awful. felt very pitu to them when they jst want to work to earn their living. 9. statistic have shown that ocbc have many high turnover rate. so i dun have to explain another long essay for this. again, im not trying to scare people off, this job, if you able to do well, go ahead. is good when you can ace this job well and you are numb enough with all of the scold from the supervisor. otherwise, dont waste time on this."}], [{"review_title": "Horrible Company", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Personal Financial Consultant in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Location Medical benefits Holiday allowance", "cons": "Pressured to work 7 days a week or made to feel bad Officers offer no support and rude to you if you ask for help"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Vice President", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stable place and job securiry", "cons": "No clear direction and slow"}, {"review_title": "Emerging Markets", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Jan 2023", "job_title": "BDM in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good culture, nice environment and ample training", "cons": "Single product, high turnaround and moderate-high targets"}, {"review_title": "Bad corporate culture, no mutual respect.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Relationship Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible in terms of working hour.", "cons": "Very BAD corporate culture, this is not my first job but definitely the worst working experience, the so call area manager will just shouting at staff, they are not there to guide you and the manager are not knowledgeable.. nothing much to learn and grow other then hard sell. you just have to swim and survive on your own.

This place is a top-down dictatorship and at the end of the day, the person at the top decides it all.\r\n\r\n2. The top person puts numbers in front of its employees - Which explains the high turnover in the department (average of 5 to 6 staff tenders in the period of 6 to 8 months as an executive role, multiply that by 2 to 4 times for sales staff) Every employee is seen as a number not human. You\u2019re expected to sell your life to the company and work even after 12 am into the weekends and even on your leave. What\u2019s the point of giving you so many benefits when you don\u2019t have the life to use it?\r\n\r\n3. No foresight (Root of all evil) The management here has no foresight and constantly wants to be first in everything, which is good but what\u2019s the point if you don\u2019t maintain your first-mover advantage and launch a product which is flawed? Agile means launching a product with it\u2019s essential/critical features are ready and not launching a broken product and fixing it AFTER it is launched. That is why there is so much firefighting over here and it is honestly a vicious cycle. You\u2019re just firefighting because of the flawed process/product you have designed/launch initially which made the workload heavier instead of lessening the burden. (Then you blame your people for not hitting the KPI). As much as the acquisition is important, do allocate some money for your retention team and don't expect solutions to be free - What's the point of having a good striker if your goalkeeper allows the other team to keep scoring? \r\n\r\n4. Listen to your experts \u2013 SCRUM Team is a team formed by specialists who are seasoned in their respective fields. You don\u2019t design an entire system without input from any specialist but just a product manager just because you \u201cLike/Trust\u201d the PM and think that what you designed is what the customer wants with different officers calling you every day. Honestly, if I were a customer and you called me every single day just to ask me to accept your loan offer, I would go to a competitor bank with a more efficient service, better rates, and less irritating and seamless process. (Feels like I\u2019m being nagged at by different teachers for the same homework every day) \r\n\r\n5. Honestly, this is one of the companies that still practice discriminatory hiring \u2013 E.g Why does a First-Class Honours Graduate and 2nd Upper get paid differently when other banks have already scrapped this practice? (FYI, Diversity is not included in its core values) \r\n\r\nOverall, I cannot express how disappointed I am with this company.
