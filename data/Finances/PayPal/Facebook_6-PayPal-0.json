It may seem counterintuitive or unconventional, but if you can properly approach and overcome the cons, then they will be pros. PROS: It's a good company to work for if you are coming in with a high salary if you are able to negotiate near or beyond the max of the range. I negotiated near the top of the range and the range got lower after I joined. The total compensation package should be considered beyond just the base salary because there are ways to double your compensation (or better), even though it is a publicly traded company now, not still a unicorn startup. These non-base-salary components of the compensation package require that the company's stock (PYPL) price does well, but if you are a key player at the company you can help the company to do well with it's stock performance as long as the market conditions are favorable. If you like to learn new things or you are new to the field/industry, this is a good company to stay with long term. You will have access to long term benefits like sabbaticals. Lots of people are getting paid well for not working, based on their years of contributions. As with any company there are layoffs. Regardless of whatever the criteria is that these layoffs are based on, layoffs at this company are not a con if you compare to other companies. If you get laid off, as with other major companies in this industry, you can negotiate or maybe even be offered initially a decent severance package when you exit (again, getting paid for not working based on your contributions during your tenure is another positive aspect of working at the company because they try to value your dedication even if you get laid off). If you are the type of person who anticipates cost cutting and quits before the layoffs come then it's a non issue other than your own strategy precluding you from severance enjoyed by thousands of other employees. You may have seen some high profile technology companies with extremely generous severances which are maybe 2-3x more than what you get here, but it\u2019s still better than most companies if you look at all industries. The company culture is strongly LGBTQ+ friendly and the company will celebrate your gender transition. Obviously if you don't identify this way you can still fit in just fine. You will work with a diverse group of people from all walks of life and the company will promote inclusion and protect a diverse culture. This is an opportunity to learn about other cultures and go to other countries where you may even learn a new language. The company gives to those in need and has a strong impact, achieving the vision of democratizing finance for those who need it most. There are charity programs in the organization which facilitate donation matching to give to charities and non-profits which are approved and you can submit charities to be added. The company facilitated a huge amount of government payment to people who needed money for Covid. The company provided relief for people in Turkey who suffered the earthquake. You will have opportunities to choose to speak in front of many people at the company on many different topics from business to technology and social issues that the company\u2019s impact can improve. Work hard every day, keep an open mind, and you can really make a positive impact here. You can move around to different teams in order to gain more experiences without having to fully off-board and onboard. This is a good way to build a network of managers and others who will vouch for you. Last but not least, I am giving the highest number of stars for the CEO Dan Schulman who in my view has upheld a strong sense of social responsibility and he had a strong sensitivity to social issues. Dan could make you feel like you were really making a difference and I believe I was. Dan\u2019s leadership promoted one-team behaviors (collaboration instead of blame-games). Dan\u2019s leadership facilitated and strongly drove a very strong sense of customer championship. Arguably the customer is the number one stakeholder. Take care of the customer and almost everything else will fall into place for the rest of the stakeholders (investors, stockholders, employees). I wish Dan well in his retirement which he announced would be at the end of 2023. I believe that Dan's vision and legacy will live on because he is a sensitive, hard working, impact focused CEO. Sorry if you didn\u2019t get a chance to work under Dan before he retires.", "cons": "CONS: The cons are basically how the pros could affect you depending who you are and how you conduct yourself, so arguably there are no cons (hence 5 star rating). Even though I performed well enough to receive bonuses, awards, and even raises: base salary raises and cost of living adjustments together did not keep base salary in step with inflation over the years according to any inflation calculator. Base salary gradually slipped tens of thousands of dollars behind inflation. This is actually common with most companies. If you negotiated a salary in the 90th% or better you may be able to make up for it as long as the company stock price is on an incline and you take full advantage of ESPP, RSUs, perf stock, get other awards and bonuses, then base salary falling significantly behind inflation is not a con as long as you can still negotiate toward the top of the range. I can\u2019t complain about this because when stock prices were skyrocketing my total compensation one single year \u201ccompensated\u201d for the other years. Go to work for a company you are invested in or else you are wasting time including your own. I invested my time, energy, significant amount of my base salary into the company and I was rewarded. Depending on your timing, level coming in, rank advancement or lack thereof, who you are dealing with, and your negotiation skills moving in and out of the company your mileage may vary. Managers and other senior staff leaving the company caused a lot of shuffling. It\u2019s worth mentioning that even the CEO is leaving. If you find remediating these inefficiencies to be emotionally or cognitively daunting it may be a problem for your velocity, but not an issue as long as you can discipline yourself to push through the daunting work or alternatively see it as a time to move on. This is not the only company effected by senior people leaving, so you should weigh it relative to other companies you are considering. Depending on your grit and capability to focus, and exit strategy, your mileage may vary. Job security might not be a thing you get from within the company if you come into it with a high salary relative to your peers ranking similarly in the company, but since staying long term resulted in my base salary getting tens of thousands of dollars behind inflation I was better off getting my job security from managers and peers who vouch for my performance to my next employer. If you are a top performer who demands to be paid like one you might not stick around for your sabbatical or other long term benefits even if you perform and intend to stay that long. If you are considering this as an opportunity to learn and grow your experience rather than meet expectations and be paid like a top performer then this is probably not an issue and you may in fact have some job security at the company since some have been at the company for over a decade. As a full time, permanent member of staff who recognizes that I am not a permanent fixture at the company there was some distraction and pieces to pick up after surviving layoffs until 2023, but again for those primarily learning and looking for experience this may be an opportunity to wear some hats left behind by top paid performers and non-performers who were let go in group reductions of force. My managers never reprimanding me and even giving me awards and performance recognitions perhaps should have but did not exempt me from the reduction of force criteria. Depending how much your job security strategy depends on remaining employed for relatively longer terms by a single company, your mileage may vary. Another complaint I heard from peers which wasn't a problem for me but the company has strict security policies which some staff think makes them produce output more slowly, but this is more efficient than other companies with similar regulatory and security requirements. If you are only concerned with your ability to have high velocity output you should be taking laxatives and spending the day drinking water sitting on the toilet instead of working at a company handling people\u2019s money. I don\u2019t believe this to be a paypal specific problem, but rather a finance-tech problem where there is an inherent culture conflict between high velocity innovation culture and security requirements. Some say security is inversely proportional to convenience, but you can and should overcome this for the sake of the customer. Innovation and at least secure operations are in fact what the customer deserves. If you are a customer champion, then this is a challenge you may be rewarded for overcoming. Depending how well you negotiate fact-of-life type friction in your workflow, your mileage may vary. Maybe not a con for everyone but for some people who don't like commuting, you may be required to come into the office regularly or semi-regularly even though for most individual contributors commuting shaves off significant time from your productive workday. You will be required to collaborate remotely with people all over its global presence regardless of whether your online meeting is coming from home or the office. You may also be expected to pivot hours to be available for global collaborations, which isn\u2019t a bad thing as long as you don\u2019t also have to commute. Your mileage may vary depending on your situation (such as your manager, location policies). You have control over this when you decide whether or not you want to join the company, but if you are moved by middle management to a different team under a different manager, the expectations may change. Your mileage may (literally) vary."}, {"review_title": "Excellent company with great values", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "7 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Senior Manager in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The company lives their values, Flexibility and trust", "cons": "Ability to get projects completed is hindered by complexity of organisation"}, {"review_title": "Good company to work for but...", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "11 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Operations Specialist in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Looks good on CV (recognised brand) - WFH option - Medical insurance (VHI) for the whole family - Sabbatical every 5 yrs - Travel Saver/ Bike 2 Work scheme - Pension plan - Flexibility re: work days/ hours (depends on role) - Support (depends on teamlead/ team) - Recognition (depends on teamlead) - Bonus - RSUs/ shares", "cons": "- Target driven micromanagement culture - No recognition for loyalty - Limited flexibility re: work days/ hours (if you're in certain roles or want to progress to Management) - Limited support (some teams have a toxic culture with little to no support) - Company recognition (Bell curve grading)"}], [{"review_title": "Good company to work for but...", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "11 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Operations Specialist in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Looks good on CV (recognised brand) - WFH option - Medical insurance (VHI) for the whole family - Sabbatical every 5 yrs - Travel Saver/ Bike 2 Work scheme - Pension plan - Flexibility re: work days/ hours (depends on role) - Support (depends on teamlead/ team) - Recognition (depends on teamlead) - Bonus - RSUs/ shares", "cons": "- Target driven micromanagement culture - No recognition for loyalty - Limited flexibility re: work days/ hours (if you're in certain roles or want to progress to Management) - Limited support (some teams have a toxic culture with little to no support) - Company recognition (Bell curve grading)"}, {"review_title": "Good perks but no room to grow", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Software Engineer  3 in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The work-life balance is taken into account.

"job_title": "Sr User Experience Designer II in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent benefits package and big talk on inclusion and accessibility.", "cons": "PayPal has an excellent benefits package and possibly the most positive and inclusive work atmosphere of a company I've ever worked for. The 'doer' people are amazing and generally care for one another. Well, at least they were. But unfortunately, over the past six months, PayPal has hemorrhaged that great talent. Perhaps four director-level leaders, a dozen or more manager level, and 30-50 user experience professionals of varying experience, and that's a conservative estimation\u2014all while mandating a hiring freeze and leadership's refusal to promote to fill the open manager positions internally. \n\nThe work is tedious, mind-numbingly simplistic busy work that doesn't live up to the expectations they hyped during the hiring process. Did you like playing with legos growing up? Then, PayPal is perfect for you. They'll tell you to pull creative direct from an obnoxiously rigid component library while being told to 'think outside of the box.' Prepare for a six to seven-step review process more like a firing squad than constructive feedback sessions. If you make it to the Sr Leadership review, be prepared for pushback on how the product should work because the cart-before-the-horse process skipped all UX strategy and planning steps and triads to discuss functionality. Prod tells you exactly what features to build, and btw, there's no wireframe step in this process either; it's straight into designs (see rigid component library). Good luck! \n\nSpeaking of the UX processes, there isn't one. During my first month at PayPal, the Director of UX pulled a hundred or so UXers together to brainstorm process efficiencies. Yet, a year and a half later, leadership didn't implement a single process improvement. \n\nManagement is very condescending and dismissive, and the product team consistently undermines and undervalues the role and importance of UX. (see prod creating features in a silo and presenting to UX.)\n\nYou are told from the get-go that things \"are always changing,\" and I think that's true, mainly because no one in leadership knows what the other leaders do. Leadership does NOT actively or meaningfully communicate with each other unless something is broken, and they are NEVER straightforward to their employees or remember what was discussed with them. So be prepared to have 'clear' to-dos coming out of a Friday meeting, only to be questioned about those to-dos the following week as leadership will straight-faced tell you they never mentioned them. \n\nPayPal brags about being innovative but only promotes the ideas of complacent yes-men they can directly profit from and fails to achieve even basic functionality with its systems most of the time. Every design used is buggy and either half-built or half shut-down (PP canceled three of my products in less than a year. Two before launch.) Tech issues keep people from working for hours at a time, and depending on your geolocation, late-night meetings are a norm (think 11 pm-1 am.) PayPal also has no-meeting Fridays. How great! Unfortunately, few take this company-wide mandate seriously. \n\nThe minute you think for yourself or question management, you are in the wrong. The minute you catch up and get a sense of direction, everything changes arbitrarily and with no notice and little direction/resolution.\n\nPayPal celebrates individuality as long as it helps them save face. PayPal does a lot of excellent PR headlining stunts, but those are only for show.\n\nThe only real thing about PayPal is its frustration from its users, and with their secretive, clueless leadership team, that won't ever get better.\n\nPayPal does an excellent job of putting on the facade of the \"perfect employer,\" but in the end, it only cares about lining the pockets of its board members and corporate elite. Our bonus this year... 5-8 shares of stock valued at $70. Literally. Sr Leadership and above however received $. People left in droves. \n\nLastly, you'll be underpaid and oversold on \"it's all about the stock\" as they throw handfuls of the 66% less in value shares your way. Everyone who PayPal hired in early 2021 has seen their shared plummet and is kicking themselves for taking a lower salary on the promise of all that stock. Well, at least I am, and those I was close with shared similar stories. \n\nA job at PayPal UX might be suitable if you don't want a challenge and are comfortable coasting in your career."}, {"review_title": "porque es una  plataforma  bien   yo  que nido la   oputunida de que ne  me dicen es vueno  faci  pa transferir  bien", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "El dinero es algo muy importante para la mayor\u00eda de las personas.
