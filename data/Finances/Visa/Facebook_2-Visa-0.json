Essentially, the job role has to be created, and the internal staff seeking a promotion via that role, has to apply. Then you'll be compared against several other external candidates.\r\n\r\n2. The above is all smokescreen. It is nothing related to how much effort was put in, or even how impactful your work is to the company or her clients. I've been reprimanded more than once not for the work that i did, but that i didn't take the opportunity to network with my clients' higher ups(as a data scientist!). Clients can even write-in to say how much you've uplifted their business and all you'll get is a nice email pat on the back. It's all about visibility, the correct people knowing you, a lot of sales talk, and politicking with the right groups.\r\n\r\n3.

You'll see middle managers who cannot move up for one reason or another(usually politics), start creating more layers of reporting under them. These additional levels of reporting serve no additional purpose, and just adds fiction and more powerplay into a typical workday.\r\n\r\n5. Visa prides itself as an open and culturally inclusive workplace, but it really is a very US-centric environment. In any country office you visit, extroversion and (tactfully) speaking out will get you to higher places much.

If you're learning different languages it's a great way to practice, be it spanish, mandarin, korean, hindi - you're bound to find someone who's a native speaker!\r\n\r\nIT services(not to be confused with IT infrastructure) are pretty efficient and responsive, they also solve the problem almost all the time.\r\n\r\nLastly, you'll benefit from one of the best corporate branding around town, having Visa on your namecard or resume drastically improves your chances of success!", "cons": "First to preface, I've worked in a few offices and your experience will likely differ depending on your department and direct manager.\r\n\r\nThe level of ideals in People really start to diminish very fast once it gets to the ground where most of the work is being done. The team-leads here will parrot what leadership says and have obligatory one-off meetings after results of a survey are not as flattering(ie dismal). people managers also tend to put more energy into managing upwards to their higher reports.\r\n\r\nwork-life balance\r\nmy department has none of that, both the business folks and the tech people work like mad. They appear to knock off at 6 or 7 but they are really just taking their work home. I've had several days where i worked into the wee hours of the morning, slept a few hours and dragged myself back to the workdesk. Some of it is due to how in demand we are to our clients, some of it is due to slow(and expensive!) IT infrastructure, all of it avoidable if some frameworks for resource planning were given. During Covid 19 lock downs, my department slashed to zero all vendor fees but the work that needs to be done remained, the workload practically quadrupled the next week! I was pretty sure if the virus didn't get me the workload here would've.\r\n\r\nSalaries, compensation, promotions etc\r\nThe starting salary is above the market average, if you're in tech Visa won't be paying you what FAANG companies do, but it is decent. The rank you come in would likely remain there with annual increments, unless you've hovered there for some time, like 5-6 years or so. Promotions are pretty much the only way to properly bump your pay(alternative being to change employer), and visibility and relationships with your direct manager and HOD plays somewhat too much a role in who gets promoted. While Visa is a global company it is still very much a Western one in culture that espouses interaction. If you're one of those quiet ones it's quite easy to get passed over for years at a time even though the work is consistently good and reliable. On the flip side, for someone who has been ear marked as a \"talent\" it is pretty obvious, they would get projects with visibility opportunities and help to make sure a promotion comes through the next year.\r\n\r\nTech and tools\r\nThe servers they use to run data analysis is hugely massive but somehow manages to also be excruciatingly slow. We've lost deals and missed targets simply because the work couldn't be processed by the servers fast enough.

Visa is indeed accepted almost everywhere. In terms of Fraud and Security, they don't hesitate to invest in resources and people to protect their network and brand. Paying with Visa is super safe and I have been proud of working for such a great organisation. The company offers great training, coaching, resources and volunteering opportunities. There's no time to get bored. Depending on the role or department, you can get involved in large international projects which can be quite interesting. If you have children, Visa is the place for you. They love families and provide benefits and concierge services for all ages. Not so good for young professionals looking for a vibrant culture. The work environment is quite dull. It is a company mainly geared towards employees with families. You may find the opportunity to work along well known financial institutions, it is a great place to develop a network of contacts. They are finally trying to offer a competitive salary but other players with less financial resources are willing to pay higher rates.", "cons": "Some people at Visa have been there for over 20 years and have a really old-fashioned approach to work. I doubt they would be employable in similar roles if they leave the organisation as they live in silo mode. It is a Top-to-down management decision-making organisation whereby employees have no say. Matrix hierarchy which doesn't help with accountability, because everyone is a \"leader\", but when it comes to executing my decisions, I am reminded of my inferior role. Career development is amazing (courses, training) but career progression is non existent. Hence why some individuals are seen doing the same exact job for years and complain when new starters try to get help from them. It is extremely rare when internal staff move to internal positions of higher ranking. The only option is to move horizontally, but it also means you have to change your specialisation. Therefore, instead of having the best professionals of a particular function, they invite you to go for another different role, as if any of us have any opportunity to become the next COO. It is by far the messiest organisation I have ever worked for. Trying to find information is full day job, be prepared to ask the same question to five people and get five different answers. Only people with great muscle memory should apply for a job at Visa, as there are no processes or procedures in most cases, and if there are, good luck with finding what and where they are. Normally, these are quite complex jobs, but Leaders seem to believe we are all easily replaceable as they couldn't care less if you leave. Silo mentalities and lack of collaboration are part of the organisational ethos. The disconnection between Senior Leaders and the Team are abysmal. Many Leaders with lots of experience in managing large organisations, lots of town halls and good words, great communicators, but when it comes to the day to day we are left on our own. They want us to be faster yet laptops are very old, disruptive, slow, the laptop can freeze when typing an email! It seriously feels like Leaders provide the instructions and walk away, waiting for results. You are on your own and are expected to do your job plus fix everything else that doesn't work. Goals are entirely unrealistic and the only way to achieve them is by getting rid of the flexibility they claim to give, by working long hours. They have now introduced micro-management by checking results on a quarterly basis. They need to look beyond numbers, unfortunately they don't. As many other companies, they also want us 3 days a week at the office which hinders are productivity. If Face-2-Face is so important, why aren't we visiting our clients? They claim RTO is important for their culture, yet hot-desking couldn't be messier, the team can't sit together so not sure what the point of RTO is. Plus for a company claiming to be concerned about ecology, they should be aware that commuting impacts our carbon footprint in the planet, yet \"company culture\" is more important. Lack of planning is rampant, Leaders are also too busy trying to join 20 meetings a day, forgetting about their teams. The organisation gets messier and messier everyday. It does feel like nobody cares and the day to day consists of putting out fires. They really need more people managers, but specific to the functional strategy of the team, someone who can do the job of the team, not just supervise then. It is astonishing that they care so little about the quality of their organisational structure and then wonder why everything is so slow. In terms of work environment, it is entirely corporative, no team building activities, be prepared to be at your desk without speaking to anyone for the entire day. Lots of Yes-Sir people not able to bring their voice for fear of retaliation. Some of them react dramatically if you criticise anything about the organisation. My advice is to work for Visa if you can but leave before you become complacent. It is a great place to learn and grow, don't hesitate to apply for a role, but once you learnt everything about your role, be ready to move on to another organisation, as career progression simply won't happen. Work environment feels quite toxic at the moment and you shouldn't put a price on your mental health."}, {"review_title": "Managing Director", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "19 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Director in Miami, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work life balance, benefits are good and flexible work schedule.", "cons": "Pay scale is skewed when moving up from within, same level coming from exterior companies get paid a lot more."}, {"review_title": "Phenomenal Work/Life Balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Staff Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This company is not only about the clients, but it spends plenty of time and effort to make their employees comfortable in the workspace.", "cons": "Taxing wait on gaining access to all of the required tools/applications necessary to effectively support the new role that one is in."}, {"review_title": "Great People - Mediocre Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Network Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits Moderate pay increases(when available) Spectacular individuals to work with and learn from", "cons": "Terrible senior management Impractical business practices"}, {"review_title": "Good company with latest tech stack", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of exposure of latest technology, domain and peoples", "cons": "Micro management and politics in the team"}, {"review_title": "Decent Pay, work dependent on team", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stable work, good appraisals, very less chances of layoffs even during recession.", "cons": "Work is team dependent, some teams have amazing work, others not so much"}, {"review_title": "Overall organization", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Senior Director in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Exciting tech company culture with strong and stable brand", "cons": "Frustration by staff who are paid less than people in same role in SF, for ex (comp is based on geography) though generally competitive for Toronto"}, {"review_title": "Great W/L balance with above average pay", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Staff Software Engineer in Foster City, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture Awesome business that never dies", "cons": "Above average salaries Lots of corporate levels"}, {"review_title": "Nice culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Business Analyst in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People are friendly and it's fun to work here", "cons": "Hard to get things done because it's so big"}, {"review_title": "Good place to start with", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Sr. Software Engineer in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A good place to work", "cons": "visa does not pay well"}], [{"review_title": "Great career opportunities/company mobility", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Account Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The biggest pro in my opinion is the massive amount of career opportunities at Visa.

You get a single floating day off (\"holiday\") per year, aside from that you have to accrue PTO (across the company regardless of level). If you're sick or need to take off before you'e accrued PTO, your pay will be short since they also don't allow you to borrow against PTO. No stock when you're signing on No office amenities aside from black coffee (even with upping office time requirement, there are no snacks or food available).

New hires outsourced to India with little to no skills and experience in the field as every decision is cost driven. Known systemic issues are swept under the rug because the company don't want to admit to fixing serious issues and costly mistakes. With 50% of time spent on pencil pushing, 30% on running scans and then the actual 20% on VAs, PCI webapps / APIs checkbox testing, you're not tester but a compliance control auditor. The job isn't about finding and exploiting vulnerabilities, it's to provide a rushed gating check because Visa has no confidence in its products which tells much about failings in development, deployment and SSDLC testing. \r\n\r\nJob advancement/security (0/5) \r\nAfter several years with the company as FTE, I applied for a role that was advertised on Smart (visa.com) public web portal. My line manager confirmed that I had far exceeded requirements for the job, reached all objectives needed to take on the role, and that applying was only a formality. \r\nI was unable to reach the first interview stage. My application got rejected because of an unwritten HR policy that didn't permit skipping a job level. Proven track record and capabilities were irrelevant and internal levels meant everything when processing my application. I was not allowed to transition into an open position available at Visa because I had been categorised as belonging to a group of people. Absurd covert rules deny internal staff equal access to workplace opportunities. My complaints were brushed over as \"miscommunication between departments\". It's beyond words how demotivating, damaging and humiliating this was to my career development and well-being. Working here has been like self-harm, allowing oneself to get beaten up for performing and delivering.  \r\nThere's very little scope for learning. Training budget got severely reduced in past years due to cost cuts and Visa University has nothing to offer in terms of real life technical skills development. With formal study time non-existent, you need to spend your free time to stay up-to-date on industry developments and trends. \r\n\r\nJob work-life balance (1/5) \r\nLittle respect for work-life balance, and the company is under the impression that everyone should work hours that fit in with US pacific time. \r\nIt's a top-down, office-first company with dinosaurs in charge who hate people enjoying work because they want everyone to suffer like they did. You are expected to commute 3 times per week to the office, sit in a wide open noisy room like a cafeteria on same days as everyone else in the building to \"collaborate\". A lot of time and resources had been spent on making stuff up why returning to the office beats remote working, which now are wasted on office attendance tracking.  \r\n\r\nSalary/Benefits (2/5) \r\nThese are below the market rates and enough to keep you going for some time. Promised \"substantial\" salaries increase  in 2022 turned out less than half the inflation rate. Stock options only for yes-men. \r\n\r\nJob culture (0/5)\r\nBanking culture on steroids, boys' club where blind loyalty is expected by leaders who surround themselves with unquestioning staff that do their bidding. Extremely political, toxic and anxiety-inducing work environment. Machiavellian, untrustworthy and petty line managers are left unchecked due to useless and absent HR who is only available via a ticketing system.

The investment is always on new, outside people...the grass is always greener mentality. Thus leaders and staff that truly care about creating value continue to leave. Those interested in taking credit and focusing on very little (but making it very known) stay and get promoted. Senior leadership/CIO doesn't see it, it is shocking. They have an opportunity to understand what is truly going on by interviewing leavers, but they just chalk it up to the hot job market. They spend so much money hiring and training and then lose the high performers.

There are awful people managers who drive entire teams and top performers out of the company, yet these managers stay in their roles with no consequences (maybe they get some weekly \"coaching\" to check a box). Visa has a ~2 hour manager training online course before allowing people to have direct reports. It's really luck of the draw if you get a good manager, so make sure to vet your manager A LOT during the interview -- ask to talk to their other direct reports. \r\n\r\nVisa sent a bunch of internal surveys about returning to the office and the majority of people wanted to work remotely. Instead of listening to their employees, Visa decided to have everyone return 3 days per week. Leadership is going in the office and making a big display about how great it is to try to entice people, what a joke.
