People who are the backbone of their team are often overlooked and management take them for granted. \r\n\r\nMany stay at JP Morgan for their whole career and focus too much on getting promoted (not their fault, the culture is rewarding the wrong behaviour) and playing politics rather than becoming better software engineers.\r\n\r\nForced return to the office despite majority of employees prefer working from home.

One could make $60K vs. peers $120K, while performing better than others.\n\nJPMC encourage mobility but it's not a real mobility. It's easy to move internally doing the same thing with little or no salary increase and no career advancements. The valuable and well-paid positions are highly competitive and a lot of these positions are external hires or Investment Banking positions (Hiring Ivy graduates). There is little or no chance for loyal internal employees who work in JPMC for 5 or 10 years. Even if experience and qualifications meet the job requirement, it could be harder than going to the moon.\n\nThe management has problems. When the team lost US employees, management hire offshore teams to re-fill. The offshore team is larger than US team in one of my roles in JPMC. \n\nThe senior management needs to figure out where the budget was spent.\nManagement makes top money but some associate-level employees spent years with JPMC are not even making as much as entry-level employees.\nMyself start with a ground level job in JPMC making as much as a cashier, when I move into higher value teams, my pay never go up that much to stay competitive with my peers or industry average, I am always the lowest range no matter where I move internally, even though my education and certifications, experience and work attitude are superior.
