They hire with higher package to attract talents , at the same speed they do not hesitate to fire anyone , even if a person is highly skilled and  adaptive to different technologies.\r\nThey should accept external talents and make them comfortable to environment. \r\nMore than half of IT people in JPMC are in depression due to bad politics and inefficient managers.\r\nBut why do they work in JPMC even if they are depressed? - Reason behind is no one pays high package apart from JPMC or other banks for their profiles, they have to survive here till they are hired by some other banks  to pay loans and other commitments. \r\n\r\nManagers are 3rd class people , they are not trained on people management. These guys are in JPMC for many years without seeing outside environment . Cheap  behavior  and low class mentality. They do lot of micromanagement. They monitor on employees desktop screens and monitor the timings we  login and logout. Everything will be taken into performance management if they plan for negative review .But this rule is not applicable for manager lovers or followers(hutch dogs).\r\nMoreover , for any issues , we can not approach HR , HR comes only on joining and exit.\r\nAll decision making on an employee are done by managers and Leads. They give open challenge to everyone  saying that nothing can be done if we decide on anything. A very open politics , no company can compete on this politics. \r\nChances of bonus depends on managers feedback , if he likes a person bonus will be approved , if not no bonus or hike. \r\nI request all viewers to consider my feedback on GTI Technology , my feedback is just a beginning , more feedback's and reviews will follow after me from JPMC Technology division. \r\nA mass layoff planned in a silent way for IT Professionals in JPMC India ...

Micromanagement and EDs note down the employee in/out time, lunch/snacks break duration. \r\n5. Anyone can give any review for you and you will need to explain it. Creates a unnecessary competition between peers and same level peers are asked to give the review anonymously. \r\n6. No work life balance. Working here is like you are a animal, and your manager can call you and ask you to work at 1am also. \r\n7. Just the maintenance work and nothing new to learn or to code. \r\n8. Even if the employee has met a serious accident, they would still expect the employee to come to office and work for them. Else they will take it out in your year end review. \r\n9. Managers don't have the guts to say anything about you in your face, but will go around and tell about you all bad and incorrect things in front of everyone when you are not around.\r\n10. For India employees, the meetings are always scheduled at late night which are of comfortable time for other regions. The meeting timings should be equally well balanced for all the regions involved. \r\n11. Employee are expecting to not have any personal life even after working hours and weekends and can be asked to work on weekends (with no extra appreciation or benefits)"}, {"review_title": "Good if you are with the right team", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- When I was there in 2015, very less politics and more work.\r\n- If you are in the right team, your efforts will be recognized.\r\n- Above average pay.\r\n- Good Infrastructure.\r\n- Decent Food Options.", "cons": "Newer management hires diluted the work culture and bought with them dirty politics from their previous organizations."}, {"review_title": "Slightly unstructured", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Associate in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good level of pay packages and work life balance", "cons": "Slightly unstructured as they are still finding their feet in the world of offshoring.

This type of treatment is promoted & supported by Human Resources and the Executive Management teams which is very inconsistent with their employee handbook.

Okay online training", "cons": "This is a comment made by a Market Director (MD) of Wealth, \u201cBranch Managers are a dime a dozen, we don\u2019t need them, we need good bankers\u201d. Prepare to feel extremely undervalued. Your bankers will be the rockstars and will get all the credit by almost doing the bare minimum. Too many times I heard how perceptions are made early on by leadership and if you are not perfect you will build a bad image to your regional director which kind of destroys any future opportunities, unless you make your life your job and prove to them how you are their property. You are expendable, remember that.  As managers, you will spend 70-80% of your time as a teller or a banker, you will hardly do any managerial tasks like coaching, observations or huddles, but are still expected to do those and when you are not doing them you better gave a good excuse, and when you explain your good excuse (low staffing, technical problems), it will not matter to them and will still label you as incapable. It seems like there is some high level executive, consultant or analyst that fears their job is becoming irrelevant or is just bored, so they create new initiatives/programs/titles on a weekly or monthly basis and expect you to follow them, even though you\u2019re still trying to roll last weeks roll-out. Expect to be extremely overwhelmed. They expect to be this cool advanced bank but fail to recognize that they are too BIG and can\u2019t do everything that a smaller bank can do. They expect their employees to be these creative geniuses but can\u2019t define which kind or what they should do to be these geniuses, example: this one Branch Manager provided incredible results and was moved to a flagship branch but when a high-level executive visited the branch and got to meet her for 1 hour, she said she was not \u201cinnovative\u201d but when asked to explain on that she couldn\u2019t even define. There is ZERO accountability for bankers, associate bankers or lead associate operations when it comes to controls, everything will be your fault, even if you had no relation to the issue, or you took appropriate actions or you coached to the issue, you will still be blamed. There\u2019s a popular saying, \u201cyou don\u2019t become a manager for the salary\u201d, that\u2019s because you\u2019re paid on the low end. Your bankers will make more than you, especially the PCB. Promotions are partly based on your likeness, the perception you had on others or if you pissed one off. Everyone talks smack about each other, even your MD will talk about you and your employees to other managers (peers) and other MDs, it\u2019s like high school. MDs have zero confidence on your ability to lead the profit of your branch. They\u2019ll tell you that you have to manage it as your own business and be creative, once you do and report positive results, you will be told to do it the other way and how they want. Technology SUCKS, your ATM will break down,  systems will too, prepare to be embarrassed with clients and to receive bad surveys for that, oh and your MD won\u2019t care for that reason. Staffing is terrible, and this is done on purpose, you will always be short-staffed just not according to a report. You will work 50-60hrs per week, even though they\u2019ll tell you how much work life balance matters. If you are a High Potential branch, you will be part of sessions that are used to report, share and help but are really a pressure cooker of tension meant to intimidate, embarrass, corner and insult. It will be extremely awkward and uncomfortable during these High Potential meetings. They bring clients for money not for the relationship, once they get the client, they move on to the next one. You are running around putting out fires when your bankers are making 80-120k and don\u2019t even care about the success of the branch, this company builds the most selfish individuals. Bad salary for amount of stress. HR recruiting is useless, you are expected to recruit your own people. Face to face training and virtual training are horrible, everything is high level stuff and niceties, no substance or material that will actually help you in your daily activities. You will be put with this training mentor and are supposed to be coached by them, that\u2019s not going to happen, expect to learn everything on your own. You will not be trained on reporting that is necessary for your branch, but you are expected to know all of it by the time you are placed, if you don\u2019t, you will be looked at as a bad investment, therefore, get with your mentor or look for someone to teach that to you, not your MD because she will think you don\u2019t know anything.
