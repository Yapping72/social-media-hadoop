The first of which are the vacation times allotted per employee. Technologists are generally given 4 weeks right out of the gate when they join the company. I don't know if that is the case anymore, but it can always be negotiated in the initial hiring process. \r\n \r\n      Additionally, the company provides a very flexible workplace experience, technologist's are often involved in pilot programs that improve the day to day work experience. As such, luxuries such as working from home via remote connections, signing up for virtual workstations that can be accessed anywhere, and blackberry adoption are encouraged.\r\n \r\n      The benefits that are offered to the employee are great and provide coverage for pretty much anything you can ask for. The system also allows for modifications to benefits when life events such as marriage and childbirth occur so you can easily adapt it to changes in your life. \r\n  \r\n      With the employer being a large financial institution, your 401k organization is generally very well explained with a great management system that allows you to allocate money to funds at your whim. Additionally, the company will match your contributions up to a certain percentage. Granted this only occurs if the company is doing well. \r\n\r\n    The work culture here provides for a very diverse experience. People have been and will always be very accepting, cordial and professional with you. I have never had or seen a conflict in the office that was not resolved quickly or with either party feeling bitter or resentful of the outcome. \r\n   \r\n      The bottom line is that JPMorgan Chase is a globally recognized brand, as such, attaching the name and experience to a resume gives you instant recognition in casual conversation and helps your resume stand out should you choose to search for a new job.", "cons": "The good talking points above also come with a significant amount of bad aspects as well. Unfortunately the biggest drawback to employment here is found in your advancement and compensation process. The system works on a yearly 3 point scale of either meeting, exceeding, or lacking in your performance goals. Only technologists who rate in the exceeds category can stand any chance of  raise that gives the employee an improvement in their consumer purchasing power while the rest of the employees will get a minor pay increase that will possibly cover the cost of inflation over the year. Cash bonuses generally are small for technologists as they don't bring revenue into the bank and therefore shouldn't be a deciding factor when you choose to work there, no matter what any recruiter says. \r\n   \r\n    Now this ratings system may sound like a fair process, and in theory it is, in practice however it is not. Only ten percent of the entire bank's population of 180-200k employees can get the rating that puts them into a chance to make more money. The process of identifying and placing those employees into the categories is also a purely political process. Placement is often decided by management levels that are several above yours, thus putting your fate into the hands of someone who you most likely never interact with beyond saying \"Hello, how are you?\" to at Christmas holiday parties. The end result is that the ratings that are desirable tend to go to the supporting employees that directly report to the executives that decide the ratings as they have the most daily interaction with them. This is a broken system that has been acknowledged as such by several senior managers, however, no real action beyond streamlining the current process is being done to correct the system. \r\n\r\nThe end result leads to many talented and hardworking employees that are left in the cold over the years that have left many demoralized to the process and untrusting of management when year end review time comes. \r\n  \r\n   Aside from the big pain point listed above, there are always the nuisances that come from working with a large corporation:\r\n\r\n. Bureaucratic red tape: could be used to decorate the halls for every holiday and there would be plenty left over afterward to use as toilet paper. Your going to need a form for everything you do. \r\n\r\n  Reliance on cheap offshore labor: from a bottom line standpoint, it makes sense, cheap labor provides a lower operating cost. However, the companies that are contracted have high turnover rates and in the technology realm you cant rely on keeping your contacts for long. \r\n  \r\n  Gatekeeper Employees: this term is used to describe the large number of employees that have built processes or permissions solely around themselves to ensure job security. This is especially bad in the technology realm, you will be working with one or two subject matter experts per application. \r\n\r\n  Unqualified Employees: this happens more than one would expect.

Hence, work in many departments and especially IT may be a lot more hectic, busy and stressful than what you would see elsewhere in the software industry. A developer may be ok, but leads and app dev managers experience constant stress, busy schedules filled up with meetings, work with hard-liner project managers with outdated management methodology, and in many cases exposure to a lot of negativism by people impacted by location strategy or stressed out by their managers or deadlines, pushing everyone to complete new urgent tasks that sometimes may not even make sense.\r\n\r\nAt the app dev manager level there is unlimited amount of meetings, administrative work and urgent emails with ad-hoc requests that you cannot ignore. Being in meetings all the time, your capacity for handling other requests quickly gets maxed out, and with changing priorities you have to pick what will not get done or will be delayed, or you can choose to sacrifice all your personal time and constantly catch up on nights and weekends. At the same time you have to also work with the development teams, so it is critical that you have strong leads that can interface more with the developers, as you would rarely have time for that if you are constantly busy with administrative work and urgent requests by the management. Prioritization and delegation are key, if you have resources to whom to delegate non-technical administrative work. You may or may not get such resources though, which for a large bank is surprising, when all you may need is just couple of more people.\r\n\r\nSumming it up, it is a stressful experience that can also be rewarding, provided that you are well-staffed and you if you balance your priorities well. If you come from software development background however, which is the most optimal case for such positions, you may not be satisfied with the amount of administrative vs. technical work. And in the end even if all is good there are also external factors that you cannot avoid, like major org changes and moves of whole departments to different locations.

It should be called reporting and not finance. I was in a multitude of finance teams in my time there. They all sucked. The hope is that if you are smart enough you can use networking and connections to get into a front office role. That is what happened for me and I secured a sales gig in the IB. The problem is if you move internally they still do not pay you like you should be getting paid so I left after a year with a front office title to boot. HR at JPMorgan is probably the worst there is at big banks. JPMorgan bleeds highly talented individuals because there is no pathway for actual smart people to get into the roles they deserve to be in. It took me 5 years and an unrelenting attitude, in hindsight I shouldve left JPMorgan much sooner. The name resonates though and it made me stick around longer in a terrible reporting role doing grunt work in the hopes of \"making it\" at JPMorgan. Mobility is a buzzword there but thats all it is a buzzword. You really have to network your butt off to get out of a finance or controller type of role. Now the big thing, PAY. Pay in these roles is absolutely horrendous and there is not prospect of a pay day working at JPMorgan. Your only option is to leave and come back if you care that much about working for the name. There is no pathway for talent to be rewarded financially wile staying internal. Everything is based on percentages and your increases will top out at 5-6% on total comp at most. That is if you are lucky. This is not just hearsay, this is the experience of 99% of everyone that works in a finance role at JPMorgan.

Working in technology is one area can be very different than another area.  I was in an older area that the company had little interest in doing anything with more than simply keeping them running.  So my opinion won't apply to everywhere. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\nThe pay is very good. Generally it can be at the upper end of tech salaries if you have the experience.  But you have to fit in with the manager.  Really, your manager is the only management you'll ever deal with.  Get a good one and life is easy, get a bad one and you'll be miserable.  Movement within the company only happens if you can get in with the manager doing the hiring.  Its all about \"relationships\".  The jobs are stable for the most part, though quiet, small layoffs happen every so often.  They just don't talk about it.  There are bonuses, and they can be great, but once again it depends on your manager.  Mine was fantastic and gave me great bonuses each year.  Other managers hold that above their employees head whenever there is an issue, and then they'll give out really small ones.  I got about a 10% bonus.  But I spoke to another employee who was being threatened by his manager all the time with his bonus and ended up getting maybe a 3% bonus.  I convinced him to look for another job.  \r\n\r\nAnother pro is that the company is very diverse.   That's a big initiative and generally works well.\r\n\r\nIts not hard to get a job here.  That can be good and bad.", "cons": "The biggest issue with the company is the management churn.  My manager had three or four different managers over the course of two years.  It makes starting and finishing projects and long-term initiatives very difficult.  You'd think that managers would pick up where the last one left off, but that's not the case.  Each manager is a silo.  As your go further up the chain, the churn gets worse.  Its not that they necessarily leave, its that they move around.  I think they worst effect is that people are not invested in their area because they know they'll leave eventually.  That means that lower-level managers are the only ones who really work in the trenches.  Talking to them is really depressing.  They know any good initiative has a 50/50 chance of fizzing out.\r\n\r\nSiloing exists and is terrible.  Managers are not accountable to one another for the most part.  Upper management doesn't resolve issues between them, nor do they care.  There is no cohesive chain-of-command.  Its very loose and whoever is the most charismatic and clever gets the job done.\r\n\r\nHR.  We have an HR?  No, we don't.  Who's my HR person?  I have no idea.  There's someone, somewhere.  Probably not at my location.  Never met a single person in HR when I was hired, nor since.  The internal website is the closest thing I have to HR.\r\n\r\nThe talent pool is atrocious.  People who have no business in technology are here.  Offshore talent is terrible.  Developers who can barely code get jobs pretty easily.  Why, you ask?  Poor managers, sure, but mostly terrible, terrible recruiting.  Horrifically bad.  Their \"recruiters\" are offshore talent that have no idea about the job or the location.  They can't schedule things properly, and they can't talk to the candidate properly.  Candidate wants to know where to park?  Forget it.  Directions?  Might as well Google it.  Properly scheduled video conferencing room for an interview?  Good luck even getting a room that has a phone.  The recruiters sometimes get a little belligerent.  Decent talent walks away almost immediately.  Good talent doesn't even bother to apply.  And then onboarding takes months.  Employees show up sometimes without having any sort of equipment on the first day.  JPMC got rid of all the Administrative Assistants, so no one has any idea of who to talk to or what to do or where to go.  Its all handled by some ethereal system in the background.  Want to feel like a cog in the machine?  Work here.  If you're the only team member at your location, then you'll sit there and stare at your cubicle walls for days while things may or may be happening.  If there's an issue, there is little notice and even less done.  It takes individuals who actively chase after things to get someone onboarded.  Hiring someone is utterly embarrassing.  My team has had two people leave almost immediately.\r\n\r\nCompany culture is fake and empty.  Sure there are lots of initiatives and events and videos and training, but its devoid of real caring.  Its all about optics.  They got rid of the long term people that run the various locations, so the replacements are churners who don't care about making a cohesive group.  Its like a commuter workplace.  People come and go.  Upper management smiles a lot.  The good ones move on quickly.  Pounding sand is the number one activity at Chase.\r\n\r\nMorale sucks.  Everyone knows the above issues.  And I had it easier than most.  People put on a fake a smile and try to make things work, but inside they're slowly dying.\r\n\r\nBut hey, the pay is good, the benefits are decent, and your job is pretty safe.

There is no way to become an associate sooner if you do a good job. Not only that but after working your a off for three years you need to do the A2A process (analyst to associate). This is also a joke because they use it as their excuse not to offer you something in case things are not going well in the company. So you could have worked there for 3 years and then if they don't want to promote you, instead of accepting it and being straight forward they use the A2A as the perfect excuse. I luckily quit before the process to go to business school but I have many colleagues that went through it and the whole thing was ridiculous. Everyone is only thinking of him/her self so there is a lot of back stabbing and the work environment is appalling. They pay a HUGE amount of importance to face time and I hated it. If anything someone that can get the work done in half the time should be rewarded higher than the analyst that stays up till very late to send an email so that everyone knows that he is in the office so late... compensation is good but is not very different from other banks. The training in NY is very cool tho. Also I was working in Europe and the American mentality doesn't really work here the same way."}, {"review_title": "The Behemoth is losing steam", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Sept 2014", "job_title": "IT Analyst in Geneva", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Lateral moves: several people are able to move from support function (IT, operations) to FO analyst (in the A2A program) or to the non-IT project team.

As a financial service representative for J.P. Morgan you won't have any misunderstanding that you can be replaced at the drop of a dime. Policy changes come often and frequent and many times even the management that's above you doesn't know about the changes until a representative is caught by our quality control saying the wrong thing to a customer and they're penalized for it. Survey scores that affect your score card given by customers cannot be reversed no matter how absurd they're request was. You as the representative are penalized (I had a customer ask for a million dollar credit limit with no income) the customer was unhappy that I couldn't help him and left an all 1 rating for the survey. Recently J.P. Morgan had done a mandatory shift bid for all call center locations. The process started late June 2014 and was finalized at the end of July 2014. I was concerned because I school classes that I needed to schedule and my management reassured me that once the schedules were finalized I could submit a school schedule with whatever shift I got and they would work with me. My manager got back to me in early August and informed me 2 weeks before school started that they couldn't accept school schedules now and that I could submit it late October. They absolutely refused to work with me and I was forced to leave to pursue school. The call center that I worked at lost a lot of employees and some of my friends who stayed become increasingly frustrated because of the increase in call volume after so many people left. In mid October my nameless friend put in their two week notice because of the frustration with management and high call volumes every single day no matter what time. They offered my friend part time and said they would work with any request. The lesson learned, when they had tons of people they treat you like a throw away and when they're suddenly hurting after losing so many people they treat you like they always should have. With the year and half I worked there I had 9 different managers cycle through my team. Every manager had different expectations on how calls should be handled. Moving up into management requires you to in a sense drink the cool-aid. What was most concerning was how private information was handled. Employee's are regularly allowed to have their cell phones out and in front of them when your private information is on the screen. There was a manager who actually managed to wear his Google Glass glasses around the building where sensitive information was displayed before finally the site leader saw him one day and freaked out that he had those on where it could record sensitive information. It needs to be said that this managers manager thought it was okay and only had him remove them when the site lead saw them. Employees are suppose to discard any private information that they write down during calls but no one checks anything when your leaving the building so anything could be kept and taken home. With as many security breach calls that I took about Target, Home depo, ext the fact that we could walk out of the building with note pads full of information and no one would check you is absurd and down right negligent. There really are pages worth of things that could to be said and to warn you about before you make the decision to apply at a J.P. Morgan Chase call center. The last thing I leave though is be prepared to handle the public. It's no secret that call center jobs have a bad rap. This job further confirms that very notion. You will take hundreds of calls day in and day out with no time to cool down between interactions. Customers berate you often and you will have to develop a thick skin to handle the interactions.  When you know you are understaffed and know everyday your going to come into a hostile work environment full of angry people who had to wait long periods of time it begins to wear on you even when your not at work. You'll dread going in to it and you will start to think about it even on your days off. It is a good paying job but there is a reason why they give you so much vacation time."}, {"review_title": "Employee Experience", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Dec 2015", "job_title": "Branch Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I enjoyed many of the people I worked with and if you have  a strong relationship with upper management, the opportunities to move within the company are greater.

A case in point, I worked for WaMu as a \"Workflow\" (Supervisor in training) for a number of years and went through the questionable buy out by Chase. Chase basically retained the majority of WaMu's employees and threw them into rolls that were \"Company Essential\" such as default related and some were placed into rolls that could be considered space fillers. With years of hard work and dedication promotions are typically granted to a select few who have proven themselves. I and many others were legitimately promoted and given a somewhat fair salary which included a small yet appreciated [Annual] bonus for all of our long hours of hard work. As time went on, this must have overwhelmed the system and flooded it with a hodgepodge of inconsistent salaries and made up titles/positions. A process was devised to \"level the playing field\" called \"Harmonization\". This stripped away many of our earned and well deserved titles and \"Job Levels\" which reduced us to hourly employees and bonus ineligible. Since then, annual pay increases have been reduced to little or nothing even though you have met or almost exceeded the expectations of management. This also included the loss of annual bonus payouts. Granted this was not true across the board. Default departments and revenue generating divisions seemed to have had grossly high sums of money at there disposal to compliment their employees with [Monthly] bonus payouts which at times exceeded their monthly salaries based on their performance. Over time the performance standard became conveniently unattainable so that bonuses were no longer paid out in such high volumes and up to now, not at all in most cases. Chase has become larger than life and extremely profitable. The often times forgotten \u201ccogs and sprockets\u201d that make up this vast banking machine called JPMorgan Chase & Co. are now left to fight for promotional positions that are slim to none and most often only available to the favorites of management by not alluding to the postion with everyone. At this point if \u201cNatural Attrition\u201d fails and if you were to look at everything going on with mortgage delinquencies slowly diminishing, smarter less risky loans being issued to customers and investments being geared towards the higher income and successful clients versus the struggling middle class work horses of America, Chase would have no choice but to lay off overstaffed departments or areas no longer deemed relevant such as Fulfillment. Oh wait\u2026.. That did happen!!! In conclusion Chase is no different from any of the other \u201cBig\u201d banks out there and even though Chase is a decent place to work it is and always has been geared towards making profits which in turn pleases its shareholder base. Chase places its shareholders first and bases its decisions on what best suites their needs not the needs of its employees, those putting in all the time for peanuts like Barnum and Baileys circus elephants.

This isn't REAL JP Morgan like you'd get in London...it is not a prestigious site at all and many in the company look down on the roles here.\r\n\r\nThere is obsessesion with front office because those are better paid jobs but also they look down on people who have an ambition to move to front office (all jobs there are middle office) .

And this is how the class you as people in this company. \r\n\r\nThe  Bournemouth and Edinburghs site are is the equivalent of an India call-centre for operations which they seem to have not yet outsourced abroad.

A few tech apps could easily replace 50% of the workforce in this office and the workforce is not educated  or trained enough to improve their working environment and make it more internally effective. \r\n\r\nOne building is new and the other is in laughably poor condition despite being young. It doesn't represent JP Morgan at all and it is so poorly maintained compared to other places and competitor places i went for interview\r\n\r\nAgeist workforce -  managers only hire young candidates and badger you over age when you join.  Huge bias towards hiring mainly privately educated individuals \r\n\r\nOffice is at edge of city and you have to pay for parking - makes leaving on time difficult because of traffic in area \r\n\r\nSome staff are bullies.

They are refurbishing one of the buildings to sell it later as they will eventually close it and downsize jobs after brexit. They are saying otherwise but the building is not that old but quality of it was poor. \r\n\r\nLow pay in line with other competitors such as standard life, barclays etc. They do not pay bonuses to all and the bonuses are as low as \u00a3500 when you consider how many people work an average of 10/11  hour days. Salaries are also low and opportunities to move around within the company are limited or go through an extreme vetting process WITHOUT any pay increase. You cannot transfer to another area in the company and receive a pay rise. \r\n\r\nThere is a very cringey amount of sucking up between associates/vp's and their bosses ED's and MD's.\r\n\r\nNo flexible working - leaving on time/at 5pm is frowned upon.
