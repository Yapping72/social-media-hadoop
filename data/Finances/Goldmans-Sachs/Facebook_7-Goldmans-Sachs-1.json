New hires make substantially more than the experienced employees teaching them how to do their job. No discernible relationship between individual performance/skills/education and compensation. Promotions do not guarantee any significant raise (in some cases, compensation goes down with promotion, as crazy as that sounds).\r\n- Internal mobility opportunities range from extremely difficult to nigh on impossible to obtain. People try for years to move within the firm, spurning advances from competitors and clients throughout that time. Interviews are incredibly hard to come by (arguably more difficult than by applying externally). There's no feedback mechanism, nor is anyone responsive to requests for feedback (HCM or team). Even after several rounds of interviews, people still get ghosted by recruiters and hiring managers (I still don't know the status of a position I had 3 rounds of interviews for over a year ago). Even on the off chance you do land an internal mobility opportunity, your pay will not rise at all (no negotiations), even to the level it would for an external hire for the exact same position, obviously exacerbating the low pay problem.\r\n- Relatively high attrition, in no small part due to the two points listed above.\r\n- Long hours and high stress, though no different than any other bulge bracket bank."}, {"review_title": "Great place to build a career if you can survive the demands", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Vice President", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You\u2019ll get to work with some very smart people, learn a lot, and will probably never be bored. \n\nThe culture is pretty welcoming and respectful. \n\nLots of upward mobility opportunities.", "cons": "Work/life balance, though this can vary depending on what team you\u2019re on. \n\nSenior management can be extremely demanding to the point of disregard for how much their team is being overworked."}, {"review_title": "Analyst at GS", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Analyst in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great name and learning environment.", "cons": "Culture depends a lot on the team that you're placed on."}, {"review_title": "Culture", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Vice President", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary wide it's good and gives attractive package", "cons": "Culture is too restricted and new joiners have to struggle finding their ground."}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Trader in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is a great company.", "cons": "No free coffee or bagels"}, {"review_title": "Analyst", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Company Associate in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work great pay as well", "cons": "Long hours and stressful jon"}, {"review_title": "Great  opportunity", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Sept 2022", "job_title": "AIMS Platform Management Analyst in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Learn all the task about fund management", "cons": "little exposure to investment process."}], [{"review_title": "Wmp", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Wealth Management Professional in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay, work life balance, experience", "cons": "No set career path, outdated systems, administrative work"}, {"review_title": "Banking", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Banking Specialist in Richardson, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Looks great on your resume", "cons": "Pay is horrible and they want you to work in office"}, {"review_title": "Awesome", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Love working here so much", "cons": "The DJing and party part"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work for extroverts", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "24 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Associate in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.
