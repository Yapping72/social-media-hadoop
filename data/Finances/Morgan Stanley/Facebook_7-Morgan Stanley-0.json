If you enjoy being managed like a piece of company owned technology, this may be the right fit for you 3. culture can be very demeaning to say the least. A CSA is to put up with being talked down to consistently. I had one advisor that would consistently speak to me in a very demeaning manner. I was hired to support the largest team in the branch and he was later added solo to me in addition. He was the one of the worst people I have worked with. I would tell him what needed to be done opps wise and he would argue and copy my manager. My manager would reply informing I was correct. It was known across the market, the last CSA had the same exact issues. I copied in an opps rep and she witnessed. She informed me \"Honestly, with _____, I thought he just had an issue working with women, but as it turns out he has this issue working with everyone.\" 4. The company has a policy that when an employee leaves, they do not get paid out for vacation. It is a slap in the face 5. Management will lie and make up policies. For example, I was with the firm for over 6 months in 2020. The initial hiring manager guaranteed there would be a 3% raise at the end of the year. The new BSM in Fort Worth stated I was not getting a raise because I walk brought in making so much more than the majority of CSA's in the market. Ummm hello, thats because 1. i am experienced and 2. I a licensed where as the others are not. no wonder why it caused to me being very demotivated. 6. Company is overly bureaucratic. An employee cannot say anything at all without fear of losing their job/manager retaliation 7. BSM in Fort Worth was really a horrible coach to say the very least. We would have monthly calls. She would not lead the call herself regardless and at one point got mad stating \"I am trying to get to know you.\" Please note I was written up for complete BS less than 1 month later. Oh and she had to have her boss on the phone with her because she was overly nervous and sounded like she was about to cry. It's work, not personal, I dont want or need to know my boss on that level. Fast Forward a year, manager skips 2-3 monthly 1:1's consecutively and gave a 5% $3000 raise. in April, during my 1:1, the manager appeared to really be really disengaged and bored during the call. At the end, she goes off real quick on whatever issue she claimed, threw out accusations and hung up without allowing me to respond. Fast forward a month later, I was terminated on May 31 with no write up and left completely rehirable by the firm. She clearly stated that I was fully rehirable and the termination would only impact me in Dallas (Pelase note she was also fully aware that I was to the final stage of the interview process for a role in NYC with the firm). My last official day was June 1 and as she stated solely for insurance purposes only, aka they knew they were doing me wrong. To start the termination, the branch manager of the Southlake Branch, pulled me off a conference call with my team, I asked what was going on, he goes shhh, we walk i ask again, he goes SHHHH (im not an idiot, I knew something was up all day long), he walked me to a closed conference room pauses opens the door, the Fort Worth BSM smiles and says \"Are you surprised to see me?\" at the end she goes \"So, did this really surprise you?\" She really proved her lack of experience in handling, because even I know that as a manager you say as little as possible in those instances. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE, after I left, management decided not to fill my role within the branch and cut the position altogether even though they knew the need that the head advisor for my team had especially after his accident the preceding year. This shouldve been a lay-off, not a termination given that the position was cut. But in the end, an analysis would not have left me as the least qualified rep in the branch........ But in the end, its all good, I landed a much better role with significantly higher pay."}, {"review_title": "Intellectual Independence", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Software Developer in Montreal, QC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Morgan Stanley allows for it's employees to engage in outside business activities (i.e. hobbies, startups, personal inventions) as long as you self-report them and do not use company hardware to develop anything.

But since then, it has missed the technology evolution and innovation bus. Many of its systems and platforms are legacy over 15 years old, innovation is very slow. Risk taking in technology is discouraged and generally very difficult to bring in new technology stacks or experiment with new technology. \r\n\r\nSenior technology leadership is more focused on funcitonal domain knowledge and people/client/user perception management over technology innovation, risk taking and leap-frogging. There is a strong element of HIPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion counts) culture too - if you dont agree with your manager or super manager, it can lead to your career stalling. So it encourages conformance and rarely any disagreements will be taken lightly.\r\n\r\nAt one time, it used to be in top 10 percentile of compensation for technology based roles, priding itself as the best engineering shop on Wall street. But since the last decade of the software boom and after the 2008 financial crisis, it is not even in the top 25 percentile. Compensation is no longer exciting, growth is slow compared to new age startups and product technology firms such as FAANG. Even now, Cloud computing is a novelty and buzzword at MS and there is no definite roadmap for implementation. Teams in non-US locations are generally disempowered and not part of key ownership or decision making processes. Center of power continues to be NY and unless the users are in your location, you will be treated as second class corporate citizens. \r\nFOMO, and disempowerment drives Indian technologists to accommodate calls at unreasonable times and being deferential to less competent colleagues abroad.

While you get a generous amount of PTO, the benefits were average, and commuter benefits were practically non existent as well (e.g. parking or gas stipend). \r\n\r\n-High turnover. As a result of low compensation, people were constantly leaving, causing teams to be short staffed continuously. This happened to my team and many other teams in my department. \r\n\r\n-Long hours. As a result of being short staffed, the hours were terrible. The OT pay was nice (1.5x), but working 50-60 hour weeks to only make the market average was not worth it. \r\n\r\n-Work flexibility was poor. While a lot of companies have moved to a hybrid environment as necessary, it felt forced at MS. My work could be done from home easily. I was personally less productive in office, but still was mandated to come in 3 times a week. In a world where you can easily find fully remote jobs and considering MS's shortcomings in the previously discussed items, this was not really acceptable to me. \r\n\r\n-Technology was extremely outdated. They didn't even give me a laptop when I had to work from home during COVID. You are expected to use your own computer. If that wasn't bad enough, the software we used was all very old, 32 bit, and applications constantly ran out of memory. This worsened productivity and caused more errors/problems. On top of that the technological tools I used were not transferable at all besides Excel; they need to use industry standards. \r\n\r\n-Difficulty in changing roles. I often heard it was possible to switch to a different team if you were interested in something else during my undergrad internship, but once I was hired on full time, it was clear that internal hiring is practically non existent. I never saw anyone successfully change roles, and it was never encouraged. However, when management felt like it they changed my role without me having any say.

From a hiring standpoint the salary hike was competitive for the role.\r\n\r\n2. Benefits are decent, nothing much to complaint, but don't expect more if you were working for a tech giant before who might have added additional benefits for fitness re-imbursement. I heard it is available but for people at a higher designation level.\r\n\r\n3. For the office transportation facility the firm sets the expectation in the beginning that it is a shuttle service during 08:00 AM - 7:PM Login/ logout so no door to door pickup and drop, however if you login a bit late you will have just the door-door drop (Better than not having any thing from my stand point). I feel this should not be a problem unless any one has specific concerns.\r\n\r\n4. Usually it is day shift here in which lot of people work. I have not yet heard or seen any one logging in during Night shift (Again I might be wrong as I have not see this.) which is good not to have night shifts.\r\n\r\n5. Work culture: This depends on the team you are hired. I work for the technology division in Bangalore location India. The culture from my experience is really good. My manager chases me if he sees me extending my shift so, yes they seem to be concerned with work life balance.\r\n\r\n6. Usually the managers for a employee here are employees working from other countries. In some cases you might have your manager located in India its self. Advantage of managers from different location is (again my thought), you do not have that typical Indian culture of manager. People out side the country probably would treat you better.\r\n\r\n7. The firm and Management expect employees to be transparent in terms if any blunders done or any mistakes done during the job role so things can be corrected.\r\n\r\n8. I have seen they encourage to take leaves as well, which is good. The leaves given are around 21-23 which look similar to other companies.\r\n\r\n9. Usually Indian holidays are applicable, but I guess it depends on your team as well. Most Indian holidays are covered but NOT all.\r\n\r\n10. The office premises has a cafeteria, decent snacks are available. Food is available currently as offices are open post COVID and the meal is free. But not sure until when this free meal will be applicable how is it going to be.\r\n\r\n11. Colleagues are open to help if you are stuck with work related issues.

Many employees were shocked to hear during the on-boarding that the firm expects you to close your existing trading accounts and transfer the shares to a new trading account which Morgan Stanley has tie-up with two banks and the conditions are:\r\nA. Your new trading account will be monitored by Morgan Stanley.\r\nB. You can't invest on all stocks and can invest on specific stocks ONLY.\r\n\r\nNote - Your shares previously purchased can be still kept/ transferred to the new account or sold so this is available. You can't use them further or invest on stocks which are not allowed.\r\n\r\nI don't trade so this did not effect me. But was shocking for people who trade. I guess this is why they pay more to hire due to this hidden condition which is disclosed after joining.\r\n\r\n3. Officially from a dress code standpoint as per the HR documents in India, I did not see Jeans mentioned for India region.

They promote based on tenure and not talent so expect to train your boss for years and get nowhere. I'm unsure how Morgan Stanley is successful at all, honestly. The incompetence, lack of diversity, and politics, makes this place seem like 1985. I'm sure there are some good departments but few and far between . The people are not kind or welcoming and it's a shark culture when there is no reason for it. No one will help you either if you complain and ask for help. It's a no win situation working here. If you work here, you're stuck with people treating you like trash until you leave.

They cannot provide a good justification for this decision and have actually stated that they have seen that employees work very effectively and more efficiently from home. From my personal observations a large portion of the employees at Morgan Stanley at Work are unhappy with the orders to come into the office. Management has been struggling to get people to follow the orders (they are not seeing enough people come in each week). This makes me as an employee feel like Morgan Stanley does not care about what the majority of it's employees want.\r\n\r\nThere is no concept of a Software Development Lead who runs the Agile ceremonies. Instead there are Software Development Managers. All Software Developers have to run the Agile ceremonies themselves.\r\n\r\nNote: This is only a con if you are not a fan of public speaking. Compared to other companies I have worked for and what I have heard from other Software Developers about their companies Morgan Stanley at Work requires a lot of presentations and demos from it's employees."}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Vice President in Hong Kong", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture and work ethic", "cons": "Tech side a bit complicated, help desk not very helpful"}, {"review_title": "Credit Risk Analyst", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Credit Risk Analyst in Budapest", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pros: culture, balanced work, great work environment", "cons": "salary, lack of trainings, promotions only in January"}, {"review_title": "None", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "5 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Vice Present in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strong leader in the financial company", "cons": "Worsening culture and Hierarchical authority"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Registered Client Service Associate in Orange, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of resources and tools at your disposal.
