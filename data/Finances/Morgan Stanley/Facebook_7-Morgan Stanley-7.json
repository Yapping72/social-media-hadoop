While I can't pretend to know what was going on in each business unit, it did seem that the people who had been with the firm the longest were the first to go. Some well known departments were wiped out and replaced almost entirely. I suspect this is to avoid paying an accruing pension and because of \"job performance\". The ruthless bankers and managers seemed to be the only ones that survived. Ruthless business I understand, but I've met plenty of successful people who didn't resort to ruthlessness to survive. \r\nI would also have to complain about some of the middle management. Some of the people chosen to serve in the ranks of middle management were flat out incompetent. My department was re-orged entirely, I was told my job had been outsourced, so I went out and got a better job. Some who decided to stay on got fired instead of a new job as a consultant. \r\nAll in all, it's a big name shop and if you can get in it's a good place to work, but like a lot of other big name companies, be a little leery of what is \"promised\" at your interview. You will pay dues no matter where you come from, you will probably not make as much as you thought, and after years of dedication you will probably get pinched. Wish I could be more optimistic but I saw several senior bankers in full crisis mode after losing their jobs when they were obviously planning on retiring from the company.

There are a bunch of inspiring people.\r\nYou can have a good work-life balance (well this depends on the team and a project a little bit), don't have to worry about spending some time with dealing personal life cases.", "cons": "A lot. Morgan Stanley states, that it's IT department is one of the best, and it depends on the technology stack very much, still there is tech career path. The next step, after you get there as a Technology Associate, that is somehow tries to cover the role of Software Engineer, DevOps, Infrastructure Engineer, etcetera, is the Vice President title. That takes at least 5 years and very much luck, if you are at the beginning of your career. If you are lucky enough, the team may have some specific roles that can somehow reflect where you are, but that's not part of the organisation structure.\r\nA little bit later, so as a beginning of this year, MS started to catch-up with the industry and tries to introduce Agile methodology to the Software Development. It's generally became the lead must do direction, that is, as usually it happens at multinational, have been overreacted and everything became agile, so people can get their political value out of it. But the implementation of this transformation is poor, people don't tend to follow the rules of Agile and that makes the whole stuff not working.\r\nThe system of the compensation (salary+bonus) is tragic. You have practically no idea why are you getting what you are getting. There is no conversation about your needs, typically you are just told at the beginning of the year what will be your compensation. People who has no idea what are you doing (if they have heard about you at all), decides you compensation. They do not try to keep up with the industry, once you are there, I would say it does not even follows the inflation. Last year's review was the best I got, and I still didn't get any raise. You kind of loose your motivation after you find out, it does not effect how much do you achieve in you work, what your salary will be like. You probably will start to feel yourself not valued after a while.\r\nAnother pain point for me, that the company directions are rather favored, than keeping good programmers. I wanted to relocate to NY, that I consistently communicated with the team and we figured out the expectations together. I have waited 2 years for this happen, continuously got good feedbacks about my work and was told that they really would be happy to get me there to the NY team as well. Last year's Q4 was bad for MS, a lot of budget cut that made me to wait 3 month more than the expectations we were talking about. Then an organisation structure change resulted the company mandatory relocations, that practically burned up the rest of the relocation budget before mine was even mentioned. They were rather let me go, then make somehow budget for it. As a last try, they tried to find for me a position in an another team in NY. We started to talk about about the details, agreed about some lower cost relocation, they made the position for me, then at the last point some committee decided not to approve, though the team had the budget. That was the last drop in the glass.\r\nThe focus is usually on something else then it should be on. You are told that the number one priority to provide a stable and fast software, but when you are trying to build the foundation of that, people tend to concentrate on delivery rather. Though you may have a good view on how should things get done, it is hard to do that way if at every step you have to convince people don't have the expertise in the topic. You won't get the support from the management to agree on the good standards and make them kept. They will rather choose a way where there is less confrontation with the people, so everyone seems to be happy. Yeah, the consequence is a mess in the codebase.\r\nYou can't have long-running plans, you always depend on the profit of the last quarter.\r\nHiring strategy is horrible. The diversity is considered before the actual knowledge of the candidate, if they need to decide between two candidates. I kept seeing people hired, that I never thought would ever hit the minimum knowledge I thought would be required to be hired. The randomness of budget constraints leads to situation that the company keeps missing the opportunity to hire good candidates."}, {"review_title": "It's an OK place to work with ridiculous bogies!", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Dec 2019", "job_title": "Broker in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The name brand is great and the girls working the cage were very helpful.", "cons": "Management sets ridiculous bogies that are unrealistic to attain in the short amount of time they give.

The work basically requires the intellectual capacity of a high school student.  Once you learn your group's systems that's it, you become a drone.  I was fortunate enough to work in one of the very few groups that gets to speak to clients, but based on the other groups my fellow analysts were in, there was little to no client interaction.  One of the biggest cons about working here is the salary.  First year analysts get a starting salary of 40k, which is unbelievably below the average salary for the financial services industry.  There is no bonus and from what I was told the salary bumps upon promotion are negligible (ie. Analyst I to Analyst II, etc.)  The training class that all analysts have to go through was yet another disappointment.  It was basically an intro to finance class that lasted a couple weeks (topics such as: what is a stock, what is a bond).  I guess I was expecting a more in depth class on financial markets rather than Finance 101.  Lastly, this is an operations role.  Most people I worked with said they had dreams of working in the front office one day and they took this job as a starting point to move up the ladder.  This is a pipe dream.  During my exit interview, the HR associate told me that they rarely if ever promote someone to the front office from the back office (which is what the Baltimore office is).  Front office recruiting is very structured and 99.9% of front office analysts are recruited out of college.  I think Morgan Stanley kind of misleads a lot of people into thinking that if you are successful in the back office then you can vertically move to the front office.  I never saw any proof of this happening and it was further solidified by the HR associate who performed my exit interview.   \r\nAll in all the biggest disappointment with Morgan Stanley in Baltimore was the little incentive to work hard.  If you were an Analyst I you had to be in that role for exactly 1 year, no matter how hard you worked or how much extra responsibility you took on.   There are no bonuses for Analysts so most work the bare minimum (rightfully so)."}, {"review_title": "If you are in tech, probably not a great fit", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Jul 2013", "job_title": "IT Associate in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Corporate culture, stable income, less risk, alright benefits", "cons": "All the money is spared for the banking side.

The good news is that MS is doing relatively better than most peers.\r\n\r\nThe working environment is arguably PC-focused.

I had the opportunity to take clients and prospects to hear from experts in the field, usually at high end dining establishments, as well as sporting events.  Customer service was very high on the priority list at Morgan, as it should be in Financial Planning.  There were extra efforts to cater to the clients beck and call.  And almost all of these events were covered 100% by the company.  In addition to the events, the Morgan Stanley name provided needed credibility in an unstable investment environment.  At the time of my employment, they and Merrill were the only two large investment firms not owned by a bank.\r\nIn addition to client perks and strong health benfits, Morgan Stanley provided matching gifts to msot charitable contributions and promoted community service, both by sponsoring some local events as well as providing specific dollars if you had a viable pet project in your community.

There was a tiered fee structure that rewarded larger accounts, but the way it was set up, a client could have as much as $249,999 and still be subject to a $150 fee for their account.

It even lost its HR Rep in charge of \"retaining talent.\" One would think management would be inquisitive as to this brain drain, especially when they trumpet the wealth management's staff support's \"intellectual capital\" as a point of strength in helping the firms top individual Clients. But they have not nor do they seem to care. They recruit finance and Econ majors from schools like Harvard, Brown, Georgetown, BC, Nova etc, train them up over a year period, only to lose many by year three. THE ENTIRE ANALYST CLASS OF 2008 IS GONE; all left to greener pastures. \r\n\r\nOver the last four years, there has been 4 different heads of this division. That's right- MDs in charge of managing a 300 person division that produces a half billion in revenue per year just can't seem to stick around. This volatility at the top trickles down to the next rung of management (EDs and newer MDs) where a culture of solo performance, selfishness, complete lack of communication and mendacity permeates the environment. \r\n\r\nSome  examples:\r\n \r\n\r\n- Multiple colleagues have told me, and I've heard it myself, that their manager told them that their performance review nor rating does NOT determine ones compensation. When pressed on what actually determines compensation, no manager has ever explained it. If for example you are a trader at the associate or vp level  and produced $15MM in PnL for the year, you could very well get a 'bonus' of $20-30k pretax, and a low base; very uncompetitive for a 11 hr/day job with a 1 hr commute each way. This has occurred multiple of times to multiple ppl; don't think you'd be an exception. Regardless, no manager has ever explained the discrepancy between performance and pay. One can only infer it is because the division's management is of extremely poor quality and does not advocate senior execs on the divisions value add. \r\n\r\n- stagnate compensation between analyst-vp. Many second year analysts get paid as much if not more than first-third year vice presidents. One third year associate recently left to  lesser competitor and was offered twice their MSWM capital markets total compensation. \r\n\r\n- three star associates who made VP in the last four months left to competitors after they found out their promotion came with a DROP in year on year compensation. They wete doubled at other firms. What kind of management promotes its up and coming officers only to then lower their year on year pay? Bad managers. \r\n\r\n- There is an institutional desk in the city at Broadway and 42nd- where management should encourage relationships and communication to open up, there actually is a policy that says sales staff in Purchase cannot communicate with their colleagues in the city about any market/ job related issue.\r\n\r\n- On top of a traders' PnL not being linked to anything comp related, neither are the sales force's sales commission. A sales person may do proactive trades that generate $10mm in gross credits over a year, but the managers do not attribute that work at the end of the year to that persons' efforts. Instead liken it to something that would have happened anyway. Well, what's the point of having a sales force then. \r\n \r\n\r\nIf you don't believe those numbers just do a check on glassdoor but select \"Purchase\" as location, not nyc.

However, ask yourself, how do these firms profit from month after month bringing in FA trainees knowing full good and well that only about 1 in 10 make it five years and only about 2 in 10 even make it to 18 months?  The answer:  Trainees don't cost much.  Getting new clients, even for established FA's is getting harder and harder.  The \"financial advisor\" profession is way past saturated.  Secondly, the biggest trend in the profession is for FA's at the brokerage firms to either go purely independent as fee-based RIA's, or at least go to a much lower cost/higher payout platforms such as LPL.  Sooooo, what about our trainees?  Well, even the worst trainees are going to bring in one or two or so good accounts before they self-select out due to not making much money or the firm fires them for not hitting sales goals.  And, who gets those good accounts when our trainee leaves MSSB?  You got it, the established brokers get them, NOT struggling new FA's.  Put another way, the training programs are nothing more than client acquisition programs for the established FAs.  Giving these guys the accounts is one of the ways the traditional brokerage firms try to keep them from bolting to greener pastures.  In the meantime, our trainees are back on the street trying to find real jobs.  The only trainees who ever make it are those who have either family members or a big rolodex of close acquaintances who will give them substantial money very soon.  If you are not in that category, remember:  You are expected to bring in a few good accounts reasonably soon and then leave the firm.  In short, the best outcome for the brokerage firms is for trainees to become big producers.  But, that's not the plan.  If it were, do you think the failure rate would be anything approaching 90%?  Really?  No, the second best, and by far the most likely outcome, is for you to bring in a few good accounts and then leave the firm as soon as possible.  It's a very cynical model and is just one example of why the traditional retail brokerage firms are continuing to lose market share to just about everybody else.  Even retail prospects/clients are beginning to ask questions like \"Why am I paying so much in fees and commissions?\"  \"What the heck is my performance and how does it compare to an appropriate benchmark?\"  Those are not questions the Morgan Stanleys of the world want to hear.  But, for job seekers, just understand, it's a rigged game.  Morgan Stanley, Merrill, UBS, et al have a perverse, short-term model that is designed for you to fail.  Although they are encouraging FAs to go to fee-based models, it's simply in their DNA to view all prospects/clients as nothing more than a source of revenues.  In fact, all you really have to know is that the only thing... the only thing.... that they grade all FA's on is how much money they make off of every client. so long as they don't break any regulations."}, {"review_title": "Degrading", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Oct 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They offer great benefits and work life balance.
