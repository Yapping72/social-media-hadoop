By lunch, I got a call from the temp agency telling me they feel I'm \"not comfortable'! I've NEVER been in any company that decides to end a contract after 1 attempt at training with trainee taking calls.

This lady is the work buddy of my trainer, they go on all they're breaks together & both seem like the meanest people in the building. This was a HORRIBLE experience!
