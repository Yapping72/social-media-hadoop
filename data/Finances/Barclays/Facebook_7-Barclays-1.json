Colleagues you work with are so lovely and very supportive of each other as you were all on the same boat. However the CEOs had no empathy for how forcing people who aren't and never have wanted to be call centre staff in their careers have been made to feel.

The company also provides a generous amount of holidays.", "cons": "- Compensations & Benefits: TL's get dibs on - and keep between themselves - all of the vocational activities that gain time off work and help secure end of year bonuses. They can also book holidays freely, whilst advisors have to queue and hope that the day eventually becomes available. If a TL has to stay past the end of their shift because their advisors are still on calls, this time over can be cumulatively earned to work half-days or take the full day off. Advisors that also have to stay over do not have this ability, and overtime cannot be submitted unless the call has gone 30 minutes past their shift end. - Culture & Values: Managers and Team Leaders live in an entirely different bubble from everyone else. They appear to do minimal work, and can openly talk to one another without facing any repercussion. Meanwhile, advisors cannot speak amongst themselves (even for support) unless it is within a break period or during a weekly team meeting. One specific example of this culture was a mandatory office day that marketed itself as a day for all of the teams within the department to get to know each other. Food and games - such as mini-golf and Connect 4 - would be set up round the office, and the day itself would be more relaxed than normal. Instead, advisors worked the exact same shift as normal and the TL's and Managers openly played games in front of us all day. Everything an advisor does is tracked (including bathroom breaks), and the metrics employed to assess individual advisor performance actually serve to discourage good customer service. Want to Futureproof a call by leaving notes about the conversation had with a customer? Or produce a customer complaint that provides a thorough assessment of the situation with the view of reaching a fair and honest outcome? Or send an email to another department to support a particularly complex customer issue that can't be fixed straight away? Forget about it. I mean, you can, it's possible, but doing so whilst on the call would adversely affect a very important metric known as \"Call Handling Time.\" Furthermore, making an already-frustrated customer wait whilst you complete long-winded tasks only serves to anger them further, and that will no doubt prove harmful to one's Net Promoter Score. Likewise, you could try and complete these tasks after a call, but expect a very accusatory message from a Team Leader if your \"After Call Work\" - ie. the time between ending a call and taking another - goes past 30 seconds. Ultimately, important tasks designed to help a customer often get neglected, rushed, or, quite often in my case, completed during breaks. Lastly, as I've typed too much already, TL's are supposed to offer on-call support through Teams. My TL could not be bothered with this responsibility, and therefore imposed a rule whereby any query had to be submitted as a 5-point template in order for it to be considered. We just created a new chat without our TL instead."}, {"review_title": "Amazing work culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Data Engineer in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance, good hike", "cons": "Slow movement of projects due to compliance"}, {"review_title": "good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Businss Analyst III in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good experience and work at barlay", "cons": "this is good expreicne for everyton."}, {"review_title": "Great benefits great staff", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My colleagues are really positive hard working people, who embody the values of Barclyas", "cons": "I only have 8 months with my team!
