They hire incredibly talented and hard working people, and they foster a collaborative environment where people are incented to coach and develop others. I've always been fortunate enough to have managers who are passionate about people leadership, which is really exciting as someone new out of school.\r\n2) Job variety. Whether you're interested in building quantitative models, designing marketing strategies, working on the Mobile App or new tech products, etc., there's an area of the business that's at the forefront of the field. I've had the opportunity to move around a handful of times, each time learning a new space and working with new people.\r\n3) Fun. Nothing beats loving coming to work every day. The people I'm surrounded with make me laugh multiple times per day, and the formal committees within the company do an awesome job planning activities like Blue Jays games, Paint Nights, Holiday Parties, etc. Because the culture is close knit, there's also a lot of informal fun, like after work drinks, etc.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this place is pretty awesome.", "cons": "My biggest dissatisfier about working at Capital One is the North York office location.

Performance management seems to be based more on who knows you versus what you have done.  It can be difficult to get things done because there are so many processes, reviews, approvals, and rules that you have to jump through in order to do actual work.  Some of the automation seems to cause more headaches than it has helped to make the job easier.  Things change constantly and it can be difficult to keep track of the latest method to do something is.  Attending conventions can be difficult or impossible due to limited numbers of individuals being approved to attend.   Mandatory CBTs are required on a quarterly basis for compliance reasons, but CBTs are not always appropriately targeted based on job roles, so you will most likely have to complete one or more CBTs that have nothing to do with your job.

I was a part of the rotational program so I got to experience several parts of the bank. \r\n\r\nThe most major issue I experienced was sexual harassment. My first week on one of my rotations, there was a work happy hour and a senior male commented that I \u201cwas going to be his second wife.\u201d Then, in the office, another senior male made a sexually charged comment. I told my manager about it and a sexual harassment case was filed but there was no real resolution other than he had to stay away from me. For the rest of the rotation, he bad mouthed me (even to the interns that were there for the summer). I heard quite a few racist and sexist remarks that he either announced publicly or someone else would tell me how uncomfortable they were by something he said to them as well. Yet, nothing was done. After I left, I received a request to pay back some of my compensation for leaving early. I called HR to see if we could come to some sort of agreement as I had left early to get out of a toxic work environment but they \u201chad no record of the sexual harassment case.\u201d Ultimately I ended up just paying it in full so I could move on and not have to worry about fighting with Capital One anymore. Overall, I was disappointed by how they handled this incident.\r\n\r\nAlso, they market Capital One as a place motivated people come to build something great. Most of the people I encountered were people who came from big banks who were now ready to take it easy in a less intense environment. It didn\u2019t really feel like a place to start your career and learn from the best. \r\n\r\nLast thing, performance reviews are very subjective and not transparent. If you don\u2019t have a manager who has your back, you\u2019ll struggle to feel fully valued. I tried to communicate with my manager early on and was constantly told that my work product was timely and of great quality and that I would likely receive the highest ranking, though it wasn\u2019t set in stone. At the end of the rotation, I suddenly got a lower ranking because \u201cI asked too many questions when I should be trying to problem solve on my own\u201d when my male counterpart (who several times turned in projects late and spent most of his time on linkedin looking for other jobs or facebook) got a higher ranking than me. All the other feedback was the same as throughout the rotation but I was downgraded for that reason (even though it was never communicated to me when I asked).

With such frequent reorgs, there is ample opportunity for ambitious people to try to wrest control of teams or entire departments from anyone who tries to focus on getting work done rather than playing the game.\r\n\r\nIf it weren't for the paycheck, there's no doubt that I'd call Capital One the worst decision I ever made."}, {"review_title": "Terrific place to work if you are a top performer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Jul 2020", "job_title": "Senior Manager Software Engineering in Plano, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Chance to learn AWS technology and apply it on production financial systems.", "cons": "Annual review process is old-fashioned and predatory."}, {"review_title": "Great People", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Finance Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Culture, people, benefits, training, facilities", "cons": "Lots going on all the time"}], [{"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Business Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Collaborative culture, great benefits, good work/life balance", "cons": "Collaborative culture can lead to make it challenging to make decisions / move quickly"}, {"review_title": "Closing 0 Balance accounts", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Investigator", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Benefits, Nice co workers", "cons": "Commute, Long hours, Not a flexible schedule"}, {"review_title": "Hourly rate.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Fraud Detection Coordinator in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There a lot of pros.", "cons": "Great, there are no cons."}, {"review_title": "A job for workaholics", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Capital One Senior Customer Service Representative in Muntinlupa", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, Facilities, HR, Events, and equipment", "cons": "Limited Paid Time Off, Bad management"}, {"review_title": "Great technology focus", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Aug 2020", "job_title": "IT Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture of innovation, fast paced, dynamic environment with lots of opportunities to grow professionally.", "cons": "Too many changes at times adversely impact all the progress being made and short-sighted goals take over longer term objectives."}, {"review_title": "branch ambassador", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Branch Ambassador", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "taking great care of us during covid-19\r\nexcellent benefits\r\nfun place to work", "cons": "hard for associates at the branch level to grow in the company"}, {"review_title": "N/A", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Process Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I can not think of any pros at this time but they constantly are deemed a best place to work.", "cons": "I also don't want to whine about the cons."}, {"review_title": "great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Senior Risk Coordinator in Tulsa, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great benefits. no complaints about company.", "cons": "nowhere to really grow your career"}, {"review_title": "Capital One is losing steam", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Jun 2008", "job_title": "Business Analyst in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You can get the training you need and take this elsewhere.

Once on a plan, it is nearly impossible to get off, since you must 'climb over' someone(s) ahead of you on the curve.  Moreover, as a manager it's difficult to put someone on a plan who hasn't been there already, since they weren't properly warned of the possibility, making climbing out of a low rating even more difficult.   So people scramble to switch jobs before the performance period.   So many things can wrong with this approach, it leads to alot of wasted talent and hurts morale.
