As you might imagine in a corporate setting as this the decisions on who receives what rating is highly political.  While I have never received a bad rating in 15 years I rarely am acknowledged for the excellent work I produce and have only received above average ratings in years where I expressed displeasure in previous ratings.\r\n\r\nSo courtesy of the horrible performance management practices, what you end up with is a group of nervous, scared associates who are afraid of receiving bad ratings or perhaps even losing their jobs.  The response to that by many associates is to work over 60 hour work weeks and rarely take vacation out of fear.  Most associates fall into this category.  I'm always saddened to see fellow associates needlessly work long hours and send emails around midnight out of fear.  It's really sad and super commonplace.\r\n \r\nThe culture is horrible.

From a corporate politics perspective, advancement can be highly dependent on who you work for and what projects you end up working on.

This is mitigated by them providing just about everything you need on campus but it sometimes you just want a change of scenery.\r\n- Not many options for work locations unless you want to be in either Richmond, VA or McLean, VA.  Richmond is small and isolated and McLean has an insanely high cost of living and terrible traffic.\r\n- Hard push for diversity recruitment sometimes results in great candidates being passed up to meet a quota \r\n- Performance management system is based much more on time at a certain level than actual performance.  For example, you pretty much have to move a mountain to get anything higher than a \"strong\" rating in the cycle following a promotion.

The worst part is that these people can't be in my meetings because they're double booked in someone else's.  All the while, mine was TRULY more important to the organization than the one they attended.  So, two meetings are shot while one of them could've been dealt with via email in a smart manner.  Every time I craft comprehensive well-written emails, people want to set up a meeting to discuss because they don't want to take the time to read it and think it through.

Leaders don't want to  listen to ideas from people who have gained expertise in other banks.

This leads to short-sighted org decisions, lack of investment in talent hired from the outside, and external hires at all levels feeling like they're not fully utilized or challenged.\r\n\r\n4) Performance management - claims to be objective and transparent but is very susceptible to favoritism and disproportionately rewards loyalty above other factors.

That stems from the leadership of the founder, Rich Fairbank, an ex-consultant who,  nearly 30 years later, remains closely involved in the company's direction.\r\n\r\nI think there are three principles that characterize the company's core values, and each one accounts for both pros (outlined below) and cons (next section):\r\n\r\nThe first is its Information-based strategy - Capital One takes a fiercely-empirical approach to decision-making. This focus on data and powerful analytics is what enabled them to disrupt the credit card industry (a business where decisions are nearly all quantifiable) in the 90's and it is deeply ingrained in the culture. The company places a premium on analytical ability and conducts its interviews much like a consulting interview (cases, looks for quant skills on resumes, etc). As a result, the analyst ranks are filled with exceptionally intelligent graduates from the finest schools in the nation, and they typically go on to do impressive things in business. I think nearly every person in my analyst class who went on to business school ended up at a top-7 MBA program.\r\n\r\nThe second is the attitude towards people management, which is effectively to hire the best people you can and truly value them - provide them with all of the tools they need to be successful. Capital One really treats its employees well - respect for work-life balance, provides them with all the latest gadgets on the company dime, offers robust perks like an amazing gym/free personal training, on-site doctor care, subsidized meals cooked by professional chefs, etc. Capital One's corporate culture has way more in common with Google than it does with a Wells Fargo or B of A, its peers in the banking world.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey typically match MBB comp packages for the business analyst program, and you'll work wayyyy less than someone who takes a job with an MBB. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe third is its sense of corporate responsibility and customer focus. Capital One used to have an unwarranted reputation as a predatory lender that made money off of lower-income customers' interest fees, but in retrospect I truly believe that a sense of accountability and loyalty to the customer permeates the majority of decision-making.", "cons": "As with any large corporation, there is a heavy dose of politics. There are often people at the senior management level (think SVP and up) who seemed to have schmoozed their way up the ladder and wound up in over their head. However, most of the executives are indeed quite smart and worthy of their titles, so not a huge knock.\r\n\r\nThe analyst program pitches itself as primarily strategy-focused - essentially in-house consulting - but depending on where you are assigned to work in the company/who you are working for, the job responsibilities can be far less sexy (lots of coding).\r\n\r\nThe raw analytical horsepower that exists throughout the analyst job family (including management levels) does present a double-edged sword in that decisions can tend to be OVER-analyzed. Big data analysis lends itself well to the credit side of the house, but the banking business is way more brand- and relationship-driven, and applying heavy analytics to decisions on the banking side can occasionally feel like you are killing a mouse with an elephant gun.\r\n\r\nThe social events are pretty lame (probably due to both the nerdy culture as well as the crimped budgets of a huge corporation with public shareholders).  I remember one year, instead of a holiday party where most companies rent out a cool venue and everyone gets drunk, we had a holiday luncheon, in our office, with no booze, and just lame White Elephant gifts.\r\n\r\nThere's a ton of middle-management which means it's hard to make a big impact until you have climbed the corporate ladder significantly, which is why I left for a smaller consulting firm."}], [{"review_title": "Work @ Home Fraud", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Fraud Account Supervisor in Las Vegas, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Love the company culture.

Shuttle buses are available between the campuses so when you do need to get to Richmond for a meeting, just hop on the shuttle in the morning and catch it in the afternoon to get back. Compensation and benefits are exceptional. Even in comparison to large tech firms (Apple, Google, etc.) Capital One offers similar or in most scenarios, more benefits.

So most teams don't have full ownership over what they are building and will need to collaborate very heavily with multiple other teams because another product owner will have accountability over the vertical while you own the horizontal. This causes projects to take much longer than they might otherwise. This also means that if your Sr. Dir. isn't very strong, you likely won't be able to your projects to move forward if discussions have to move up the chain. The YE rating system is cut-throat. You need to prep and stay prepped all year. Make sure you are socializing your work to every single person you can. It will come down to stack ranking with a required 5-15% needing to be rated lower than 'meets expectations'. If you keep upping your game every year, you'll be fine but that may mean taking on external public speaking engagements, leading projects that will have massive business impact that can be 100% accounted to you alone (you'll get docked if someone else can share credit, which is in a matrix is hard to not share credit).

Much of management abhors the twice-a-year process, admitting it is extremely stressful and upsetting.  Forced performance rating distribution mandates that your department has 'poor performers'.  Meaning, even if everyone is doing a great job, exactly what they are asked to do and they do it almost flawlessly, they still need to decide who isn't performing as good as the rest, so they can be in the lower performance bucket.  Managers either get in arguments in which one person ultimately loses because a manager isn't as an effective communicator or advocate as the others, or because a manager steamrolls the discussion and is so stubborn the opposing manager just gives up out of frustration, hence making their associate become the poor performer.  Associates rated as poor performers often have an extremely difficult time invalidating this label and perception, and are often used as the automatic scapegoat for future calibrations' low performers.  Additionally, once given this low performance rating, you are unable to move to a different role, even in cases where the manager agrees there is a job fit issue and the associate finds a more suitable role to go to.  Based on this, associates who stay in this category for too long inevitably are pushed out of the department and by default, the company (aka are fired).  This is frustrating, disappointing, stressful, usually unnecessary, and in many cases heartbreakingly unfair to the \"poor performer\" who is only labeled as such because someone has to be.\r\n\r\n*note* For those wondering, no, I am not a disgruntled employee writing a review, I have been rated as Strong, Very Strong, and even Exceptional during my career in the company.

Very high quality work facilities, great benefits, competitive compensation packages.

Specifically it can and does sometimes lead to a culture of nastiness, judgement, and a rigid heirarchy (because semi-annual performance appraisals are heavily influenced by committee discussions where every people manager at the next level up has the opportunity to give input both positive and negative - so there's a lot of striving to impress and never offend/disappoint anyone a step up in heirarchy). Also, people can spend their time indulging in judging others as an intellectual pastime (past the point of usefulness), rather than actually doing something meaningful - it can be an excuse for people who don't know how to get results in their own work (or who want to avoid confronting their own issues).\r\n\r\nIn fairness around the time I left that the company was starting to discuss finding ways to overcome some of these problems, and may have succeeded in the meantime. However, if you are gentle soul, who has any trouble at all taking criticism, or doesn't like being in a pretty fiercely internally competitive (although the competitiion is below the surface) environment then you may want to think carefully before moving here.\r\n\r\nOne other negative - historically Capital One has been very unplanned in having massive hiring sprees in good times, with insufficient internal controls. Then at some point they realize they've added too much overhead (either if there's an external shock in the market, or they just wake up and smell the coffee one day) and then go through heavy rounds of layoffs. As a result, especially in Richmond, Capital One has a reputation for these major reductions in force - and unfortunately this reputation has been earned.

I could watch certain associates come into a department and know that they were set aside for a promotion.  It was weird like the management was waiting for the right moment to push someone who didn't know the work right into manager position ahead of people who posted for the job and had worked it for years.  Then they came up with this new idea of how to promote and give bonuses based off of these manager round table discussions. Managers who you never worked for had a say in how much of a raise you would get.  So if you were an introvert, you could forget about it. I watched many take on new projects and work hard only to be passed over by those who were \"in\" with management socially and not \"in\" on the work.

The recruitment process is quite intense and that insures a good pool of analysts that run the business i.e. business, data, operations and statistical analysts. The positions demand fairly high competency in math, programming, statistics and the mix depends on the job family. The work place is very relaxed and casual. However that does not mean that work is taken casually. No decision is made without grounding it in data and a lot of analysis. Taking time off for vacation/personal/family stuff is not a problem at all. You can work from home on days that you don't have meetings with senior leadership. I generally like to go to the office since that allows me to interact with people, but I stay home when I don't feel like getting out of bed. Work attire is casual (most people wear jeans).

That business has always been very enterprising, almost like a start up, full of youth and vigor. Since capital one acquired 3 banks over the last 4 years, the bank side of the business came with a lot traditional banking type people. The two cultures are quite different but luckily if you are in card then you dont interact with bank at all. Capital One has tried to move some card folks into the bank to instill some of our traditional data driven strategies and ways of doing work into the old-school bank. That has been full of challenges and I've heard a lot of horror stories from people who moved there. Basically you add 20 odd years to the average of a card employee and you get the average age of bank employee and you can imagine the problems the generation gap can bring.\r\nCapital One doesn't pay as well as other financial services companies. I guess one reason it did so well in this past recession is that it gives moderate bonuses. however money can only do so much for you. The work life balance you get working for Capital One negates the lower pay. I think I've been spoiled working for them...can't imagine to leave. Wait, this was supposed to be \"Cons\" part.

Out of those 80%, ALL of them were \"buddy\" hires. Cap 1 works on antiquated tech policies that are barriers to getting anything resolved quickly. It's as if all Cap 1 full time employees came from the government sector. The brilliant idea to hire offshore technical support is just asinine. In my 2 years here I have only met one offshore counterpart that knew anything that could be remotely construed as actual technical knowledge. The money they lose in downtime of systems alone is mind-boggling.  \r\n\r\nNow for the bad news. Ready? If you're a contractor you have a 2 year life span. That wouldn't be so bad if you went into the gig knowing that, but most likely your recruiter fails to mention that. In fact no one on my team knew that until almost their 2 yr mark. Several people only had a 2 week notice their contract was ending. This was 4 days after Management came in to address that we would be there for several more years despite technical changes to their model. Apparently no one, including Cap 1 Mgmt or the Recruiters \"knew\" it was a 2 yr contract, as if it was a surprise to them. Ironically, my entire team reported to and was directly managed by Cap 1 mgmt. And with that announcement came the real face of Cap 1.  After stringing us on with becoming full time employees for two years, we suddenly became anathema--- just disposable contractors. I couldn't even get management to return my emails on anything, including their plan to supposedly bring us back on after a 90 day hiatus. Neither could my co workers. They did bring two people over as full time associates prior to the announcement. And ironically, they were two members of the good ol' boy network. \r\n\r\nThat aside, management is clueless. They are all \"yes men\" marching in lockstep to edicts from above that are devoid of reality in the trenches. The pay was great, there was little politics I had to deal with at my level, but the reality is you;re a second class citizen and no amount of hard work, loyalty, or dedication is going to change that. If you go into it knowing it's at MOST a 2 yr contract and can plan accordingly with that, you should be fine.

This agent was able to leave the department after HR intervention.\r\n\r\nNow, to say all of management was like this would be unfair, but definitely enough to make me leave voluntarily and go through the effort of writing this warning to you.

I could write a book about how horrible it is, but I'll try and condense everything below. (I WISH I KNEW THIS BEFORE I CAME TO CAP ONE. PLEASE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY)\r\n\r\n1) At capital one there's an assumption that the level you came in at is the absolute highest that you could have, and once you start, nothing you did before capital one matters.\r\n\r\n2) You will stay at your current level unless you kiss up to your manager because vertical movement at Cap One is seriously messed up. The ONLY WAY to get a role at a higher level is to get promoted by your current manager, which is very hard, or to find a role at the next level and humbly ask the posting manager if he/she would consider you for the role even if it's above your level. The posting manger will then snoop around and go to your current manager. If your manager doesn't tell this manager that you were on the promotion track you won't get the higher role. Period, end of story. You will not move up unless your current manager loves you. The assumption is that all movement is horizontal. Promotion is the only way up. (To get around this a lot of people leave the company and come back at higher levels. DO NOT come here lower than you think you're worth. It's not worth your time. Hold out for the higher role)\r\n\r\n3) Your colleagues who've been with the company longer than you understand the culture and you will suffer because of it. They know that you're the sucker for trying to get stuff done while they spend all day brown nosing with your manager and accomplishing nothing. They will get promoted and rewarded at year end and you will get the \"inconsistent rating.\" If you don't \"shape up\" and drink the kool-aid you will be pushed out. If your \"poor behavior\" continues you will be shown the door.\r\n\r\n4) You get pushed out by being given this \"inconsistent\" rating that has no grounding in reality. When this happens you can't apply to any other roles until you've sufficiently kissed up to your manager who then raises your rating. Don't like brown nosing? Too bad, it's your only way out. Please direct yourself back to point #3. Really don't like brown nosing? Too too bad, direct yourself back to point #3 twice and then find the door. Try and fight your managers rating? Too bad, you're going to lose and then your manager is really really going to hate you. You're never getting out of inconsistent and we're beyond point #3 at this point. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.\r\n\r\n5) Influence not achievements, just remember that. \"Influence\" at cap one is simply \"justification for accomplishing nothing while still feeling good about oneself.\" You can't make this stuff up. Try running  a department where every decision requires unanimous agreement from all stakeholders. Want to see how this works (or doesn't)? Work for Cap One.  Do you dare have an opinion? Please direct yourself back to point #3\r\n\r\n6) Cap One is filled with managers who've been with the company since the earth cooled. They will force-feed you the kool-aid. Direct yourself back to point#3 if you have a conscience or morals.\r\n\r\n7) Calibration... Oh I havent even gotten here yet and I'm already 7 points down. At end of year you're ranked amongst your peers and given a year end rating. Did you drink the kool-aid and were you buddy buddy with your manager? Congrats, you'll be fine. You're a high-strong to exceptional. Did you challenge the status quo and question unethical decisions made by peers and managers? Direct yourself to back to point #3 please. No, really, back to point #3. Cap One doesn't actually care about \"doing the right thing\" or \"acting ethically.\" \r\n\r\n8) Ok i'm actually just getting started but I'll stop here.

There has to be many fake reviews here. In my six years working there I didn't know anyone (at least in Retail Bank IT) who was really happy about working there. Most were absolutely miserable. On one hand, Capital One gave me a lot of experience and exposure to things I wouldn't have encountered otherwise. On the other hand, Capital One caused incredible stress to my life because of their morally bankrupt performance management, politics, dishonest and cowardly management, and constant turnover.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering working there, understand one thing....you are a number on paper. That is it. If management feels that you are not helping their agenda (if anyone even knows what it is), they will push you out by ignoring you and your work, lying about your performance, and finally firing you (they call this \"redeployment\" to make it sound less serious).  In my last year there, I worked extremely hard to go above and beyond every objective assigned to me, only to have my current manager do a pathetic job at presenting me to the performance management calibrations, which by the way, are based on the opinions of other managers who don't necessarily know anything about what you are working on. It was then I knew it was time for me to go. The whole system is not just ridiculous and absurd, it's immoral.  It is a system designed for upper management to empower \"yes men\" managers to control hiring/firing.\r\n\r\nCapital One is extremely political. I even had a co-worker tell me that to be successful there I should focus more on being visible than my actual work. Believe it or not he was right. Thankfully I found a much smaller company where I don't have to put up with all the nonsense and be rewarded for my actual work. It's absolutely wonderful. If that's what you are looking for, stay far away from Capital One. However, if you are an outgoing person with above average job skills who is good at politics, you'll probably excel.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake, Capital One is one of the best companies I've ever seen at marketing a spotless image to the outside public, but on the inside, it is toxic, although it will take new hires a while to pick up on this."}, {"review_title": "Loved it & was sad to go.
