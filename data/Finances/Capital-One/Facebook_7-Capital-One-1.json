You are pitted against your peers and compared based on accomplishments. Even if you accomplished more than the previous year, or the same, if someone else is differentiated from you, it could cost you your bonus or higher rating at review time. \n\nPromotion structure is limited after promoting to Master/team lead in an IC role.

Even before I joined the company, it took 3 months after I heard I passed the interview to get an offer. After that, I was concerned about the leveling on the offer letter being different than what I applied for. The recruiter lied to me and told me that the leveling was the same as what I applied for, all while shaming me for questioning them about it. I later learned after I joined about this discrepancy, and it really put a bad taste in my mouth, making me want to leave. \r\n\r\nOnboarding was very lackluster. Only a couple people reached out during my first few weeks to ask if I needed help or to introduce themselves, and I was given no training for new engineers. This wouldn't be as much of an issue if the documentation was good. However, documentation is very bad at the company as a whole. A lot of things that need documentation don't have it already, and the things that do have documentation have really vague or outdated information. To make matters worse, there are a lot of links to where documentation should be, and SO MANY links are broken due to different wikis being changed. This is incredibly frustrating as a new engineer because you need to ask someone for help for pretty much everything. That wouldn't be an issue, except it can be very difficult to get a response from people. If you do get a response, people tend to be rude and will assume you're doing something wrong before actually answering the question you asked.\r\n\r\nI also really disliked the work I was doing, which primarily involved fixing some really bad code that previous engineers had written. I have never seen such badly written code in a professional environment, and I was very surprised by the low standards. A lot of time was wasted in awkward meetings where nobody says anything, and one person shares their screen while trying to debug an issue.\r\n\r\nIf that all isn't bad enough, the forced distribution performance reviews are incredibly stressful, and you have very little control over how you will get rated. Everything is appearance based, and you have to basically brag about yourself constantly if you want to get better than a \"Strong\" rating. I found that a lot of things were done just to make my team look better even if they were counterproductive or didn't make sense.\r\n\r\nA lot of reviews I read before I joined said that the work life balance here was good, but that was not true on my team. There were several instances of working multiple 12+ hour days in a week to meet some arbitrary deadline set to make the team (and manager) look better. The forced distribution rating system makes it so it's difficult for an individual to decline working late when all your teammates are acting like they are ok with it because otherwise you'd just get thrown under the bus during reviews. \r\n\r\nOverall, I had a terrible time being employed by Capital One.

TDPs get the plum assignments and get promoted faster than people who came through regular channels. But TDPs use the time to brush up on leetCode skills and move on to bigger tech companies. As a way to stop such churn, CTO seems to have asked managers to promote them even faster :eyeroll:\r\n\r\n- new people managers leave within 6-10 months since they get sick of the games that they have to play to get their employees promoted.

Out of 74 possible candidates for a job category in the last cycle, only 4 got promoted, supposedly due to stack ranking. This leads to a lot of good engineers leaving for better pay. If you are interviewing for a position, ask the recruiter for the list of people promoted in the last cycle. The shortness of the list should help you decide if you want to play the game. \r\n\r\n- every team has 30-40% contractors and their talent level has dropped considerably during the pandemic.

Lots of meals and food.", "cons": "Being a minority here will be a challenging experience. The company has a performance management system that really favors how friendly you are with your manager. Usually this benefits buddy-buddy relationships. I've seen managers and higher-ups favor their online gaming friends, intentionally punish/target a team with a minoritized racial identity. You can read the comments in other posts, there are a lot of jabs at non-white members within the company, people complaining about the company focusing on hiring or promoting women. The senior leadership is pretty racially and gender homogenous and if trickle down was ever a real, its how this company works.\r\n\r\nAs a PM, your experience will be a lot of meetings and managing up. Which may not be unique to the role at any place. In my experience, I found that due to the need to impress people with decks or \"influence\" over working product or code, people invite everyone senior to meetings to voice their opinion. It's a very hierarchical company, so before any decision gets made you will be talking to every co product owner and their boss and bosses boss and boss on boss to make any type of decision. This all means you likely won't get much done.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of politics at Capital One. A Lot. So be prepared to undertake in all these games. It's a bit toxic really and probably the worst part of the job.\r\n\r\nI don't think you will gain much technical product experience. Capital One is a very product risk averse company. There really isn't a culture of testing and learning you may get at other software companies. You will hopefully get a very specific idea/product the company wants to build. Pray that the company fully invests in it, and if you are lucky within two or three years it may come to life. Within that time you will likely get reorg-ed and your project may go dead. You won't easily get access to the data of products or even company market research/strategy.\r\n\r\nAnother tension at Capital One is balancing your personal sanity with the desire to perform the Capital One Way. To maintain sanity, you will want to avoid as many meetings, interactions with senior leadership that don't go anywhere, and find a core team that you are highly efficient with. Unfortunately, the stacked ranking system benefits you interacting with lots of managers, showboating that you are influential across multiple organizations or teams, and networking. This will likely stretch you thin and just be present to too many ineffective meetings and obnoxious politics or power dynamics within the company. You will start to think about these relationships and dynamics all the time. Your life will blend into Capital One. At some point, you will probably need a therapist to remind you that all these stressors are only at the office. However, you will fill a strong need/desire to be in with the \"in-crowds\" at Capital One. \r\n\r\nMy advice is if you take a junior/principal role here, find a product in later life cycle/in market one that's critical to the company, learn the basics of managing a product in market, working with an engineering team and design group then peace out.

I happened to experience organizational changes few months later after I joined. I can write a book to rant about my experience with C1 but I would like my review to be served as an informational guide for people who are considering to accept an offer:\n\n1)  The work is easy. The majority of the time I spent here is at meetings listening other people to argue about some nonsense and work that the manager tries to put the team through in order to make us look busy. \n\n2) There are some chance that you can fall under a horrible manager.  It depends on how \u201clucky\u201d you are because reorg happens often. Btw, the definition of an \u201cincompetent leader\u201d to me: full of ego, hollow in knowledge, insecure, micromanaging, bossy, couldn\u2019t care less about emoloyee\u2019s wellbeing. It was my first time encountering toxic people in my life, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. \n\n3) Stack ranking at a bank? As many of the other reviews have mentioned, your performance is evaluated against people at the same level as you. If you get a manager who is willing to advocate for you, then you are the lucky one. Although it is not guaranteed that you will get a \u201cabove strong\u201d rating, your life will still be easier.  If you happen to get a bad manager who only cares about the time you put into nonsense work because they don\u2019t know much about tech, you will be as miserable as me :).

The only help they provided was not charging late fees IF a person calls every month to tell them they\u2019ve been affected by COVID. If they don\u2019t mention COVID they get no help. And if they forget to call one month we\u2019ll charge them late fees and can\u2019t waive them. Also we keep charging interest every month so someone who owes 300 dollars ends up deferring because of the pandemic and losing their jobs and by the time they get a new job they owe 500 dollars.

Even at the most junior levels, analysts will almost always present their own work unless it is to someone at or close to the C-Suite level. Managers also invest a fair amount in developing their employees, and it is typical to have regular 'development meetings' with your manager and your manager's manager to ensure that you are learning and that you are staffed on projects that are meeting your goals.\r\n\r\n3. Internal Mobility (Vertically and Horizontally):\r\nAt the lower levels (Analyst - Sr. Manager), people can typically expect to get promoted every 1-2 years (in larger parts of the business). There is also a culture of people switching teams, and it is not uncommon for people to take new roles in completely new parts of the company with very little friction.\r\n\r\n4. Great Internal Resources (see cons as well)\r\nCapital One has a great set of internal tools and resources to help people manage the day to day functions of their jobs (managing data, doing analysis etc). This is especially in the larger parts of the company. As a result, people here spend very little time doing 'grunt work' and are instead dedicated to very substantive projects. As a new employee, I was quickly able to build a robust profile of work, and genuinely feel that I have developed a strong cross-functional skillset (data analysis, presenting, project management etc).", "cons": "1. Lack of input in the rotation process (for campus hires)\r\nMany business analysts joining out of college will be put in C1s rotational program (the ADP program), where you are assigned one role for your first year and then join a new team for your second role. The first rotation essentially random, while analysts get a larger degree of input into their second role (although the final decision is made by the program). Many people like this because it lets them work in diverse parts of the company, but inevitably a number of people will be placed into roles they are very unhappy with.\r\n\r\n2. Frequent Organizational Shifts\r\nAs Sr. Executives come and go, they will restructure their subordinate teams. As a result, entire teams, and also individual analysts, are often move into new chains of command and may have to pick up an entirely new body of work. This happens quite often and with very little notice (maybe once per year).\r\n\r\n3. Differing experiences across lines of business\r\nIn my experience, the largest parts of the company (Mainstreet and Upmarket) tend to have higher levels of technical support and better promotion rates than other parts of the company. The higher level of technical support often means that these LOBs have staff dedicated to making your job easier by automating repetitive tasks, ensuring data is easily available, and by building tools to simplify your work. In smaller LOBs, analysts will often have to do this work on their own, limiting the amount of time you can spend on important projects."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 May 2022", "job_title": "Principal Data Analyst in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good morale\r\nFair work environment\r\nEncourages talent", "cons": "Lower pay than tech companies"}, {"review_title": "Would go back in a heartbeat!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Sr. Customer Service Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If it wasn\u2019t due to the layoffs I would be working for them still.

This was not an unusual story, especially because it is one of the largest and most well-known employers in the area. I worked at a now-defunct call center outside of Richmond, and there was a clear \"have and have-nots\" delineation between those who worked at West Creek and those who worked at my location. The site was often looked down on, or completely unknown, to the people at West Creek making five times our salary, but we were collecting the money that allowed them to have fancy perks like bicycles to ride between buildings and a butterfly garden. I can't speak to the experience at the Glen Allen locations, but it seemed that folks could much more easily move from working there to West Creek than from our site. I don't know if the site going permanently remote has impacted the career opportunities for those employees, but when I worked there you still had to be within a 100 mile radius of the site you worked from, meaning you couldn't apply for remote roles in other states. \n\nThe people I worked with were amazing and getting to know them was the best part of my job. Management supported career growth for their team members, and we were given lots of opportunities for professional development (pre-pandemic.) Having access to support groups for many different types of identities was a unifying experience that made the widely dispersed company feel a bit more familiar. I was able to gain experience in many different areas that boosted my personal and professional growth. However, I do believe that privilege plays a big part in that, as many of the other folks I worked with were passed up for opportunities time and time again. \n\nBenefits were good, with affordable healthcare options, 401k (regardless of if you contribute), parental leave, short- and long-term disability, EAP, tuition reimbursement, and occasional perks like gift cards and swag. The managers of the front line workers really care about their employees and do the best they can with the resources they have. We often had potlucks, parties, and events on site, which made work very fun and enjoyable. I didn't know everyone I worked with, but they all felt like friends. Unfortunately, this experience didn't translate to work from home, although many other sites had been remote long before and therefore had the infrastructure in place to support employees in that way virtually. \n\nFinally, learning about credit and financial well-being was one of the most valuable things I gained from my experience. I have been able to help my family and friends build their credit and feel more secure in their finances from what I learned during my time at the company. There are lots of resources available to learn and even help your community. Volunteer time is allotted each quarter, and the company matches your volunteered hours with donations. Most of the employees truly care about others, which makes for a very welcoming, friendly environment.", "cons": "Once the pandemic hit, my role began to shift drastically. We went from an \"empathy-based\" approach to \"results-based.\" It completely ruined morale, and that was before the layoffs and department closures began. People were desperately trying to leave the department and company due to the massive shift in business objectives. It became very difficult to get promoted, which was one of the biggest perks before 2020. The future went from looking bright to very, very bleak. At times, half of my department was on leave for mental health (which is understandable during a pandemic), but this trend began well before then. With everyone struggling to make it through the day and burning PTO to take care of themselves, more and more pressure was put on those who were still working. Metrics became stricter, performance reviews were graded more harshly, and everyone at the bottom of the food chain felt the pressure bearing down from the top. Needless to say, it became a pressure cooker, and most folks couldn't take it. \n\nUnfortunately, a lot of my coworkers (including myself) were going through very tough times during the pandemic, and our jobs involved talking to customers who were going through the same things. It was like living in a never-ending hellscape of sad stories. There was no relief, and we were often told to just \"focus on the positive.\" Pretty hard to do when you are literally cold-calling people who are in the hospital with covid, fighting for their life, and telling them they need to make their minimum payment on their credit card or they will be charged more fees. We had some hardship programs to offer customers at first, but there was a cap, which enraged many people who would then take it out on the phone agents. I don't know what the department is like now, but I hope things have changed for the better. \n\nCulturally, the company has lots of grand ideals about how it is changing banking for good. However, during the pandemic, I saw a complete loss of humanity in this regard. The biggest indicator of this was the cafe employees who were pretty much hung out to dry. Pay equity is something that is not discussed on any level, and when some employees tried to ask for an objective review of their team's pay and raises, the company essentially told them they should be grateful for what they are making. Complete lack of transparency from upper management and age-old tactics to keep workers submissive and hopeless bred massive distrust and disdain for a company that workers previously evangelized. \n\nMany employees were often put into stretch roles or internships, which builds great experience, but is essentially the company saving money on labor by having someone do the role without receiving the pay. There should be a bonus or differential for employees that temporarily are working more senior roles. Getting one of these internships or stretch roles was often the only way to move up, and you usually had to be hand-selected rather than apply. If you weren't a golden child or friends with management, good luck trying to get a new role. I was considered both at one time and still couldn't get hired in any other department once the hiring freeze was lifted. \n\nThis can be a great starter job or a long-lasting career. It is all circumstantial, and each department and line of business is very different. Do your research, ask lots of questions during the interview process, and make sure that you are confident of what the expectations are for your role and if it will change over time.

This was not an unusual story, especially because it is one of the largest and most well-known employers in the area. I worked at a now-defunct call center outside of Richmond, and there was a clear \"have and have-nots\" delineation between those who worked at West Creek and those who worked at my location. The site was often looked down on, or completely unknown, to the people at West Creek making five times our salary, but we were collecting the money that allowed them to have fancy perks like bicycles to ride between buildings and a butterfly garden. I can't speak to the experience at the Glen Allen locations, but it seemed that folks could much more easily move from working there to West Creek than from our site. I don't know if the site going permanently remote has impacted the career opportunities for those employees, but when I worked there you still had to be within a 100 mile radius of the site you worked from, meaning you couldn't apply for remote roles in other states. \n\nThe people I worked with were amazing and getting to know them was the best part of my job. Management supported career growth for their team members, and we were given lots of opportunities for professional development (pre-pandemic.) Having access to support groups for many different types of identities was a unifying experience that made the widely dispersed company feel a bit more familiar. I was able to gain experience in many different areas that boosted my personal and professional growth. However, I do believe that privilege plays a big part in that, as many of the other folks I worked with were passed up for opportunities time and time again. \n\nBenefits were good, with affordable healthcare options, 401k (regardless of if you contribute), parental leave, short- and long-term disability, EAP, tuition reimbursement, and occasional perks like gift cards and swag. The managers of the front line workers really care about their employees and do the best they can with the resources they have. We often had potlucks, parties, and events on site, which made work very fun and enjoyable. I didn't know everyone I worked with, but they all felt like friends. Unfortunately, this experience didn't translate to work from home, although many other sites had been remote long before and therefore had the infrastructure in place to support employees in that way virtually. \n\nFinally, learning about credit and financial well-being was one of the most valuable things I gained from my experience. I have been able to help my family and friends build their credit and feel more secure in their finances from what I learned during my time at the company. There are lots of resources available to learn and even help your community. Volunteer time is allotted each quarter, and the company matches your volunteered hours with donations. Most of the employees truly care about others, which makes for a very welcoming, friendly environment.", "cons": "Once the pandemic hit, my role began to shift drastically. We went from an \"empathy-based\" approach to \"results-based.\" It completely ruined morale, and that was before the layoffs and department closures began. People were desperately trying to leave the department and company due to the massive shift in business objectives. It became very difficult to get promoted, which was one of the biggest perks before 2020. The future went from looking bright to very, very bleak. At times, half of my department was on leave for mental health (which is understandable during a pandemic), but this trend began well before then. With everyone struggling to make it through the day and burning PTO to take care of themselves, more and more pressure was put on those who were still working. Metrics became stricter, performance reviews were graded more harshly, and everyone at the bottom of the food chain felt the pressure bearing down from the top. Needless to say, it became a pressure cooker, and most folks couldn't take it. \n\nUnfortunately, a lot of my coworkers (including myself) were going through very tough times during the pandemic, and our jobs involved talking to customers who were going through the same things. It was like living in a never-ending hellscape of sad stories. There was no relief, and we were often told to just \"focus on the positive.\" Pretty hard to do when you are literally cold-calling people who are in the hospital with covid, fighting for their life, and telling them they need to make their minimum payment on their credit card or they will be charged more fees. We had some hardship programs to offer customers at first, but there was a cap, which enraged many people who would then take it out on the phone agents. I don't know what the department is like now, but I hope things have changed for the better. \n\nCulturally, the company has lots of grand ideals about how it is changing banking for good. However, during the pandemic, I saw a complete loss of humanity in this regard. The biggest indicator of this was the cafe employees who were pretty much hung out to dry. Pay equity is something that is not discussed on any level, and when some employees tried to ask for an objective review of their team's pay and raises, the company essentially told them they should be grateful for what they are making. Complete lack of transparency from upper management and age-old tactics to keep workers submissive and hopeless bred massive distrust and disdain for a company that workers previously evangelized. \n\nMany employees were often put into stretch roles or internships, which builds great experience, but is essentially the company saving money on labor by having someone do the role without receiving the pay. There should be a bonus or differential for employees that temporarily are working more senior roles. Getting one of these internships or stretch roles was often the only way to move up, and you usually had to be hand-selected rather than apply. If you weren't a golden child or friends with management, good luck trying to get a new role. I was considered both at one time and still couldn't get hired in any other department once the hiring freeze was lifted. \n\nThis can be a great starter job or a long-lasting career. It is all circumstantial, and each department and line of business is very different. Do your research, ask lots of questions during the interview process, and make sure that you are confident of what the expectations are for your role and if it will change over time. Take advantage of all the resources the company has to offer and learn as much as you can. \n\nMy experiences are all subjective, and many of my former coworkers are still very happy and love their job. I would take any review you read on this site with several grains of salt because there is no guarantee that your experience would be any better or worse.

But there is no plan or support that allows the transition, other then spending 20 hours/week outside of work to attend community college or take courses through Lynda.com .

The one positive is there is no on-call for this position, and once you complete your 8 hours you can forget about work for the rest of the day)", "cons": "Since the pandemic stated in 2020, call queues have been a complete disaster. Most days it takes hours for users to get a hold of an IT Service Desk agent. I'm talking 100-200+ calls in the queue, with no end in sight for the agents who handle this for 8 hours every day. Between each call, there are only 45 seconds before another call comes in, which quickly leads to mental exhaustion after talking for 8 hours straight. This has been an issue for pretty much 2 years now!....2 years! To have it happen for a couple of months, fine, but any longer than that and you really can see where this item is on upper managements priority list/recognition of the dire reality of the situation. I understand it's a tough issue that's multi-facted, but 2 years is completely unacceptable in terms of the mental effects it has had on current employees.\r\n\r\nPay increases every 6 month period are usually a miniscule 1.5-3%, which as everyone knows, does not keep up with inflation (especially the 6% inflation in 2021). You can most likely get paid more by working for a fully-remote friendly company based in another high COL state, especially for a role such as this one that should already be fully-remote since it's completely over the phone. \r\n\r\nMorale is at an all-time low with most team members I speak with, people are just burned out and dread going to work in the morning, which is quite sad. Life is too short to be feeling this way, and to see it at a company like Capital One is very disappointing.\r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe is by far the lack of growth opportunities here in this particular position. Now, I want to preface this by saying yes some users have moved out of this position into other departments. For the overwhelming majority of agents however, this has not been the case. The users who did move into other positions usually had a lucky break with knowing the right person at the right time, or having experience that was gained outside of Capital One and thus could make them a stronger candidate. For those whos first IT experience was here however, even with earning certifications, it's very hard to move out of this department into other IT positions within the company. Part of the reason for this is that Capital One has a job hierarchy that restricts users from applying for other job positions unless you are currently at a certain job level. For instance, if you are Sr. Coordinator (which is what this role starts at), you cannot be considered for a role that's 2 levels above your current level due to HR policy. The company recently made it so you could apply for 1 job level above your current level, which is an improvement in terms of upward mobility for people. However, the kicker is most tech roles within the company start at Senior Associate or above, which compared to the Sr. Coordinator level, is 3 levels above that. The levels break down like this:\r\n\r\nSr. Coodinator\r\nPrin. Coordinator\r\nAssociate\r\nSenior Associate\r\n\r\nSo with this hierarchical system in place, you are destined to be in the IT Service Desk position for a long time, which I believe is by design to keep people in the position. Promotions can take anywhere from 1-3 years, and there's no guarantee when it's going to happen for you as it takes longer with each promotion. Upon getting a promotion, you do not learn any additional skills that you didn't already know at your previous level for the most part. The job responsibilities stay the same, and thus so do your skills and employability for other positions within and outside the company. \r\n\r\nGenerally, industry-wide it's often recommended to stay in Helpdesk/Service Desk no longer than a year or two so you can specialize in other areas (unless you really enjoy it). The other areas are things like System Administration, Cloud/Networking, Security, Data, etc. The problem is, you do not gain the necessary skills within this position to move into those particular areas within the company, and are left to get certifications or outside education to fill this gap. This isn't an issue unique to Capital One, but the problem is a lot of internal company positions will want at least a year or two of experience with the technologies themselves in an actual job position. Not having this experience, but having certifications and outside education will look good, and may even provide an opportunity for a lucky break as I mentioned some people above had, but overall when applying for other positions you will get denied for not having the direct job experience a lot of times. Outside the company, your predicament is just as bad as even if you do have certs/education, the position itself does not give you access to skills that can get you more than another help-desk job unless you get lucky with a company willing to view your certs/homelab as experience. You don't get your hands on managing users/groups in Active Directory, group policy configuration, Windows Server, automation/scripting, AWS/Azure, or SQL. When you look outside the company, you'll see and realize how a lot of even other Help Desk positions within large companies require these skills."}, {"review_title": "Its a job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative (CSR)", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pto. flexibility in schedule.
