At first, it seems like Boeing pays well, but if you take a step back and look at the entire picture, you can easily see that you are underpaid, overworked, and undervalued. Being salaried at $60k+ starting out looks and sounds great, but you are only salaried IF it benefits Boeing, meaning: if you work 75 hours during the pay period, you are only paid for 75 hours, but if you work 90+ hours during the pay period, you are only paid for 80 hours, no overtime - this was a first, I'm salary and I clock in and out. Working remote was a pro, but the higher-ups have made it clear that they are going to get rid of that possibility: management informed us that, starting in March (3-4 weeks away), it is mandatory to work in-office 3 days a week. COVID forced everyone to alter their entire lives, to adapt with the uncertainty, and to develop a way to continue living without being able to leave the house - over the past 2 years, majority of people did well with that arduous task, but it still took the better part of these past 2 years to create/perfect their new lives...so, with that in mind, Boeing makes working in the office for 3 days of the week mandatory, with only a 3-4 weeks' notice - hope no one has children in daycare/school, hope everyone with kids not old enough to attend daycare/school can find someone reliable, trustworthy, and under $15 an hour to watch their kids. Hmm, all my pros seem to turn into cons.", "cons": "The \"training\" you receive does more harm than good, there is no structure, no clear direction of where it's heading. The person training you schedules a slew of meetings throughout the week, followed by an endless number of slides and notes covering the assorted topics that will be covered - majority of those meetings end up getting cancelled/rescheduled/forgotten, which leaves you reading notes that you don't understand and with no direction. So, you ask management for help (which you quickly learn that management is not there to manage the team or to assist you with much, I think their only tasks are to \"put out fires\", and to email you asking why a supplier/program is not responding to your numerous emails - which should be common knowledge, apparently), and your manager will offer no guidance, but will pass the buck by telling you to go shadow someone from the team. After a month of \"training\", you are more confused than when you started, you have hundreds of pages of notes on systems/procedures that are foreign to you, but your manager decides to transfer a large amount of work under your name, and when you ask your manager how to do some of that work, their response is usually something along the lines of, \"I am unaware of that process, I think you can find slides on how to do a work-movement in the shared drive (or some website)\"; \"I've never worked with those parts, but (teammate's name) knows what to do with those and where to send them next\"; \"I'm putting out a lot of fires, talk to the team and see who can help you\"...to manage a team, shouldn't you have experience with what the team deals with - at the very least, an understanding of the team's scope? Long of the short of it, you only learn by becoming buried in work, searching for hours on how to complete your tasks, then slowly completing said task. If your manager: harasses you, discriminates against you, says you must come in and work while on PTO, lies to you about company policy, or mocks the severity of your request for PTO after a death in your family...it is futile to speak with HR about any and all of these issue because managers have the authority to \"override the directions of HR\" and will deem it mandatory to comply with their demands.

They don't have to try too hard because they know the US Gov will rescue it as its too big to fail. - Remote work is discouraged, and hybrid work is a \"privilege'\" that can be withdrawn at any given notice. Dinosaur management running a company to the ground as if its still 1989. - Good luck if you're a software engineer on some of their data science teams. You'll be siloed and work individually all while expected to be proficient in both data science and software disciplines as you shuffle through code written and deployed in subpar conditions.

It prevents some people from getting raises and promotions.  I had 7 managers in the past 2 years.  Prior to that I had 5 managers in one year.\n\nSimilar to the management movement issue, employees can be moved around a lot too.  Not as often as managers, but very often.  This is both a positive and a negative.\n\nThe company randomly assigns employees to different locations with zero notice and does not allow time for things like finding transportation for themselves or childcare to accommodate the new location and schedule requirements.  Employees are told to suddenly report to a facility 2 to 3 hours away for unknown amounts of time, usually several months.  Sometimes this comes with a \"start tomorrow\" or \"start next week\" mandate.\n\nIf you have young kids, do not work here.  Upper management is actively forcing employees with young children out, no matter how valuable they are to the company.  Flexibility existed prior to COVID and during COVID.  Now that management has decided COVID no longer exists, there is no more flexibility.  We are being forced to spend our workdays in small conference rooms for socializing and sometimes for pizza parties instead of getting any actual work done.  This is also irrespective of critical meetings on the employees' schedules.  These events take precedence.\n\nEmployees were actively lied to about their working arrangements only to have them revoked the first week of the school year with less than two weeks of notice.  Teachers are on strike in several locations here but no one is allowed to work from home or take time to find alternative care solutions to watch their kids unless they call in sick, despite being allowed and required to work from home for most of the past two years. \n\nMany metrics showed that much of the company was much more effective, productive, and communicative working from home.  Now, despite being promised hybrid and virtual arrangements, everyone is required to go back to an office where they do not provide adequate equipment to do our jobs effectively and people walk around talking to everyone (not work related), preventing work from occurring.  Those of us who work across time zones are really suffering.  We are commuting when we should be in international meetings.  Management feels the need to suddenly strong-arm employees to get them to comply to all in-person mandates, zero flexibility exists anymore.  Unfortunately this is forcing a lot of very knowledgeable and critical employees into early retirement or to look for work elsewhere.\n\nBoeing is actively advertising virtual and hybrid work offerings but when hired, employees are told they are 100% onsite or very close to that.  Don't believe any job advertisement that states it is hybrid or virtual.

At first, it seems like Boeing pays well, but if you take a step back and look at the entire picture, you can easily see that you are underpaid, overworked, and undervalued. Being salaried at $60k+ starting out looks and sounds great, but you are only salaried IF it benefits Boeing, meaning: if you work 75 hours during the pay period, you are only paid for 75 hours, but if you work 90+ hours during the pay period, you are only paid for 80 hours, no overtime - this was a first, I'm salary and I clock in and out. Working remote was a pro, but the higher-ups have made it clear that they are going to get rid of that possibility: management informed us that, starting in March (3-4 weeks away), it is mandatory to work in-office 3 days a week. COVID forced everyone to alter their entire lives, to adapt with the uncertainty, and to develop a way to continue living without being able to leave the house - over the past 2 years, majority of people did well with that arduous task, but it still took the better part of these past 2 years to create/perfect their new lives...so, with that in mind, Boeing makes working in the office for 3 days of the week mandatory, with only a 3-4 weeks' notice - hope no one has children in daycare/school, hope everyone with kids not old enough to attend daycare/school can find someone reliable, trustworthy, and under $15 an hour to watch their kids. Hmm, all my pros seem to turn into cons.", "cons": "The \"training\" you receive does more harm than good, there is no structure, no clear direction of where it's heading. The person training you schedules a slew of meetings throughout the week, followed by an endless number of slides and notes covering the assorted topics that will be covered - majority of those meetings end up getting cancelled/rescheduled/forgotten, which leaves you reading notes that you don't understand and with no direction. So, you ask management for help (which you quickly learn that management is not there to manage the team or to assist you with much, I think their only tasks are to \"put out fires\", and to email you asking why a supplier/program is not responding to your numerous emails - which should be common knowledge, apparently), and your manager will offer no guidance, but will pass the buck by telling you to go shadow someone from the team. After a month of \"training\", you are more confused than when you started, you have hundreds of pages of notes on systems/procedures that are foreign to you, but your manager decides to transfer a large amount of work under your name, and when you ask your manager how to do some of that work, their response is usually something along the lines of, \"I am unaware of that process, I think you can find slides on how to do a work-movement in the shared drive (or some website)\"; \"I've never worked with those parts, but (teammate's name) knows what to do with those and where to send them next\"; \"I'm putting out a lot of fires, talk to the team and see who can help you\"...to manage a team, shouldn't you have experience with what the team deals with - at the very least, an understanding of the team's scope? Long of the short of it, you only learn by becoming buried in work, searching for hours on how to complete your tasks, then slowly completing said task. If your manager: harasses you, discriminates against you, says you must come in and work while on PTO, lies to you about company policy, or mocks the severity of your request for PTO after a death in your family...it is futile to speak with HR about any and all of these issue because managers have the authority to \"override the directions of HR\" and will deem it mandatory to comply with their demands.

It prevents some people from getting raises and promotions.  I had 7 managers in the past 2 years.  Prior to that I had 5 managers in one year.\n\nSimilar to the management movement issue, employees can be moved around a lot too.  Not as often as managers, but very often.  This is both a positive and a negative.\n\nThe company randomly assigns employees to different locations with zero notice and does not allow time for things like finding transportation for themselves or childcare to accommodate the new location and schedule requirements.  Employees are told to suddenly report to a facility 2 to 3 hours away for unknown amounts of time, usually several months.  Sometimes this comes with a \"start tomorrow\" or \"start next week\" mandate.\n\nIf you have young kids, do not work here.  Upper management is actively forcing employees with young children out, no matter how valuable they are to the company.  Flexibility existed prior to COVID and during COVID.  Now that management has decided COVID no longer exists, there is no more flexibility.  We are being forced to spend our workdays in small conference rooms for socializing and sometimes for pizza parties instead of getting any actual work done.  This is also irrespective of critical meetings on the employees' schedules.  These events take precedence.\n\nEmployees were actively lied to about their working arrangements only to have them revoked the first week of the school year with less than two weeks of notice.  Teachers are on strike in several locations here but no one is allowed to work from home or take time to find alternative care solutions to watch their kids unless they call in sick, despite being allowed and required to work from home for most of the past two years. \n\nMany metrics showed that much of the company was much more effective, productive, and communicative working from home.  Now, despite being promised hybrid and virtual arrangements, everyone is required to go back to an office where they do not provide adequate equipment to do our jobs effectively and people walk around talking to everyone (not work related), preventing work from occurring.  Those of us who work across time zones are really suffering.  We are commuting when we should be in international meetings.  Management feels the need to suddenly strong-arm employees to get them to comply to all in-person mandates, zero flexibility exists anymore.  Unfortunately this is forcing a lot of very knowledgeable and critical employees into early retirement or to look for work elsewhere.\n\nBoeing is actively advertising virtual and hybrid work offerings but when hired, employees are told they are 100% onsite or very close to that.
