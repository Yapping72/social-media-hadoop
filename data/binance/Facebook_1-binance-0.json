HR team is incapable and the team hierarchy/structure do not promote any fair system to fully investigate most incidents. Results: Bad blood stays on, proliferate and continue to leech on new blood that onboard into Binance.\r\n2.

These are the people who would rotate to different teams and functions every quarter, arm with their incapabilities, only to find themselves staying afloat by doing the bare minimum and \"talk\" their way out. Result: Bad leaders stays, good team members lost faith and quit.\r\n3. Toxic work cultures. They would sold the idea that people who work in Binance are \"passionate\", would be willing to clock in so many hours willingly. Due to peer pressure, most would conformed \"or succumbed\" to this and do the same, else risked your performance. Result: People burnt out or jeopardized their mental health, I've seen so many people quitting due to this and the HR or company do not simply care.\r\n4. Self-proclaimed \"innovative\" and \"user focused\". But these values are determined top-down, the one on top and \"louder\" gets to say on what is innovative and what is user focused, not by the real facts. Result: Putting on a good show but the product experience improves very slowly.\r\n5.
