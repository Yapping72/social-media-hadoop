I was hired as a contact tracer towars the end of July of '20 and when things got really heavy in the late fall some of my colleagues and I were trained to work with people who had Covid, not their contacts, which is a much more involved process--those people are called case investigators, and make at least $3 - $6 more per hour, nobody's willing to say--but the fact is we weren't given a raise. We deserved some kind of raise, and when we asked our recruiters for it were told they were busy hiring new people who would all be trained to do the same thing so they couldn't. It turned out to be only partly true, but the fact that UHG was unwilling to remunerate employees who they moved into a new position (without asking if we wanted the job)--they actually created a new job title for us, cross monitor--and expect us to work harder for them without complaining...I've had a couple of teammates get fired \"for cause\" all of a sudden after complaining that we were doing work we weren't hired for.

Writing a note for the next tracer letting them know that the child's mother couldn't finish the call because her other son was being discharged from the hospital, so please wait and call back in a couple of hours? Unproductive. Going to the bathroom when it's not one of your scheduled breaks? Definitely unproductive!

The STD contracted provider is difficult to work with and in most cases will deny at the first level review however they do have a good appeals department with competent staff and fair medical directors and if the disability is legitimate they will approve on 1st appeal. That is not the case however with the LTD contract provider, they are governed by ERISA laws and know they do not need to be under any actual legal oversight and will fight any approvals, legitimate or not, if already approved by STD or not or if already approved by Social Security or not, they have hired their own MDs who do cherry picking and flat out bad faith denials and the disabled employee will be not only be sick but will be in the fight of their life trying to get approved for the LTD benefit and most often they will wear the employee down and force a settlement for pennies on the dollar. This company does not even open their case files for UHG HR review, they are self funded, they collect their own information, they hire their own doctors and they do their own denials, the employee has no right to jury trial or even a session before a judge under those ERISA laws and bad faith denials are the norm rather than the exception."}, {"review_title": "Good place to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Financial Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great team collaboration across different departments.", "cons": "Too many managers, not enough employees."}], [{"review_title": "One sided", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "15 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Individual Contributor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good amount of PTO and very flexible", "cons": "When they need to save money they let go of employees that have been there for years regardless of performance as they tend to make the most in pay.

And when those people actually do show up? They don\u2019t perform so you are still doing their work. Then comes raises and you think , okay I\u2019m going to be recognized for my hard work.. but put on the face guard because the slap in the face is severe. Raises are not performance based. Bonuses are shared and not worth the hassle you endure by management and being overworked. Loyalty means nothing. Don\u2019t plan on thinking this is a company you can stay and retire with. If it\u2019s a first job, steer clear because it will destroy your confidence in the healthcare industry. I have seen high turnover before but nothing to this magnitude and has nothing to do with COVID.  The company bleeds of greed because they are too focused on profit and upper management and provider raises. I have an extremely positive attitude but they even penetrated my good nature by harassment, micro aggressions, passive aggressive attitudes, and carelessness. They treat you like your some sort of miracle worker that\u2019s capable of things only God can do. This company caused lots of health and emotional distress. If you bring violations to the attention of higher ups they twist it around into a major drama and act like there is something wrong with you and will make you confront the person in violation to \u201cwork it out\u201d. Ummm no nah uh. What\u2019s to work out? I\u2019m not the violator, the thief, the liar, the law breaker. So this results in you better keep your mouth shut and if you see something don\u2019t you dare say something. The operations manager was petty, immature, unprofessional, and would try to divide the team, and was successful in team division. They operate on \u201cit\u2019s not my problem and not my fault\u201d. You will spend an exhaustive amount of time reporting equipment malfunctions and 6 months later they decide to work on it and or address it. Then it works momentarily and breaks again. After awhile you give up and just drown. The clinic is not even half staffed and they add more work and have the audacity to question why work is not getting completed on time. It won\u2019t matter  if you know what you doing, are skilled, have a solid work ethic. This is a sales position and they get all the commission.

I have been with the company 5 years, and in that time I have risen four pay grades and increased my earnings by 74%. So know that it's definitely possible to get good raises and get ahead, although it is also very challenging. How can you accomplish this? Be professional at work. Don't miss work without a good reason (try saving sick days for when you're REALLY sick). Work hard to make quality and production metrics. Be resourceful, accountable, and approach problems with solutions instead of complaints. Volunteer for extra projects when possible.\r\n\r\nThe incredibly structured and micro-managed atmosphere surrounding metrics actually makes it a true pay for performance environment. Your work speaks for itself. When your yearly review comes around, your supervisor has tangible data they are pulling from, and it's not just based on what they sort of think they remember you did over the last year or how hard you tried to get on their good side.\r\n\r\nThis a Fortune 14 company. UHG is EVERYWHERE. With much of the workforce telecommuting (either working for home or from an office reporting to different sites), a lot of boundaries are broken down, and in theory you have a wide variety of options for career movement that would not exist in most traditional company settings.\r\n\r\nI have had incredible supervisors who have developed me and promoted my talents and strengths every step of the way.\r\n\r\nUHG has very high expectations, and working there has prepared me well for so many of the challenges that any workplace could throw at me.\r\n\r\nWAH opportunities abound for those who are interested.", "cons": "It's not all flowery praise.

We see what is offered in terms of plans. We are not getting a fair deal there, and every single person working there, bottom to top, knows it. UHG has some amazing healthcare plans available - just not for its employees.\r\n\r\nThere are so many departments with different rules, systems, and procedures that communication and issue resolution between internal business partners is a sad, complicated mess. Things are never streamlined. I do think they try, but they don't succeed.\r\n\r\nEverything is about numbers, and at the end of the day, most people care less about if the numbers reflect accurate data, or if the data has simply been collected in a manner which makes it APPEAR that things are on target.\r\n\r\nTalent Acquisition is a train wreck. There is up to a six month lag period in some of their systems (which no one will admit to, but is evident). I have been grilled by people on my ability to use MS Outlook (?????) who are just supposed to be validating my responses to the questions I answered online. Look, if I've been exceeding expectations on my performance reviews, I can probably use e-mail. I have had recruiters fail to set up interviews; if there are any issues, often the recruiters do not respond to e-mails, and CC'ing their supervisors doesn't do much either. Well after accepting a new position internally, I was still getting contacted by TA for interviews for positions I had removed myself from, and I was recently contacted to take a survey because they show I am applying for positions currently.

This is a large company but the worst I have worked at my whole career as a nurse. Dept. had me as salaried but I had to take PTO for anything not work related, even if it is for 30 min, but as a salaried employee, I had to take PTO in 4 hour increments. No flex time or comp time were ever offered to me nor anyone I spoke to, for MD appts. or anything not work-related. Even as a salaried employee, I had to make up time. If working over I was told to log out on time and continue my task. From my experience, my dept. see Impossible metrics, made the job more like an assembly line of calls. My job was a strict call-center environment. Meeting metrics meant you not reading charts or prepping for calls. I sat in dialer all day taking cold calls like a customer service representative, with breaks and lunches clocked to the minute, with Immediate IMs from running behind on a call, causing break to run late. I couldn\u2019t leave my desk while in dialer, not even to sign for a delivery, unless I got permission. I didn\u2019t work to manage cases, I existed to staff the dialer. Literally, I could not get anything done even when it wasn\u2019t my day to be in dialer for the harassment to go into dialer. No work/life balance, manager expected me to do work related things on my personal time, like applying for licenses and reading CEUs for other states over the weekend. Doesn\u2019t matter that my license is compact. Only 5-10% of nurses of entire program were let off for one day, which made it very hard to be off for urgent needs unless I called out. The micromanagement is a beast at this place. I needed permission to do anything other than opening or closing cases. Trust me, the money isn\u2019t worth it. The health insurance is the worst. I am convinced this is where nurses go to be broken.\r\n\r\nI also planned to escape my dept. but found out the hard way that none of the jobs listed in job sites are actually eligible for internet transfer. The only jobs I saw open for internal transfer were the ones like mine, that no other nurses want. The turnover rate is so high here, you get constant case transfers from nurses quitting. Nurses are literally here one day and gone the next. This place also has an intense bully-type culture.\r\n\r\nThe pay is a little above-average, which is the only plus.

Eventually you start giving into the bureaucracy and plan your days around the least path of resistance. Externally, Optum is positioned as a youthful, innovative and modern company, but that is not that culture on the inside. I question their ability to attract and retain creative individuals.

They have a great support system and lots of resources to help you on a day-to-day basis with customer calls, but it can be really stressful if you're someone who doesn't know how to handle that type of situation. Especially with the possibility of getting a call from a really upset customer, which of course happens in the insurance field. I'll be honest that I worried often between each call because I didn't want to get someone screaming (or sometimes cursing) and I may not know how to help their situation. I'd have to put them on hold so I could reach out to other resources and they DO NOT like that. You also have to be okay with change and be able to keep up with new information. Lastly, you have to be okay with being monitored. Since you work through the computer the company provides, you are also using systems that track your activity. You are responsible for governing yourself every day and if you're not doing a good job of that, you will absolutely get a message from a supervisor or manager. Sometimes they may ask \"is everything okay?\" or just flat out ask you why its taking you so long to do whatever it is you're doing. So. This job could honestly be a dream for someone who can handle this type of work environment. The Pros are really unlike most jobs and those alone make the job worth it.

Before UHG purchase averaged 8-10 percent merit increases annually. After UHG purchase of med express average 1-1,5 % increase annually. No more than CPI. Monthly request days on schedule reduced from 7 to 5. Semi annual bonus used to average 2500-3000. After takeover less than 3k annually can be expected. Doors dont lock until 8pm (12 hour shift) and no patients turned away. If seven to ten sign in at 750 pm expect to work late an hour or more with no compensation. All providers are considered \u201cexempt ie salary\u201d. No overtime pay. 401k match reduced from 4 percent to 3.5. Annual CEU reimbursement reduced by 500-800 annually. Long mandatory teleconference scheduled before 8am or after 8pm with no compensation. Before UHG take over when supervisor asked for Practitioner to pick up extra shifts time and a half and often double time offered. Since UHG takeover supervisors rarely offer incentives to pick up extra. They expect you to be a \u201cteam player\u201d and work extra shifts at straight time rate. Often clinics are short staffed of ancillary personnel ie nurses Med techs. Providers are expected to continue with their responsibilities and pick up responsibilities of short staffing ie triage patients, give injections ect. Overall, since UHG takeover, morale overall has significantly decrease due to above mentioned. Supervisors inform employees how well the Company overall and stock price is doing while at the same time UHG has taken away compensation and other employee incentives. UHG is a very large company with over 300k employees. Its very evident employees are not valued and you are nothing but another number that can be replaced. Nothing like Med Express used to be when owned by Mr Alderman who treated and rewarded all his employees like they were family."}, {"review_title": "It was a great company.
