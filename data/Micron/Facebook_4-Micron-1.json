Management pays a lot of lip service to innovation. However, they are only interested in innovation that is very specific to the product. Peripheral innovation is often ignored or disregarded. The culture focuses on a reactionary instead of proactive approach to engineering.

While there is still cost-cutting during downturns, there is less kneejerk cost cutting. The company is now leading the industry instead of being the perpetual laggard and has a healthy profit margin and cash flow. Sanjay and his team has done a good job with this transformation. There is more focus on work-life balance and on employee satisfaction and feedback as well which is positive and real pressure is being applied on departments that are lagging in either. Some departments suffer from a dog-eat-dog culture of toxic politics and constant scheming, kingdom-building and maneuvering rather than collaboration. Other departments truly work as a team, everyone pulling in the same direction. The good news is that, being a large company, there is generally an opportunity to move to a different/better department if your current one is not a good fit.", "cons": "Your experience will still, to a very large degree, depend on your managers and your VP. My experience with different departments has been day and night, so make sure to ask employees in the department you're planning on joining for their honest feedback. While there is much more focus on work-life balance and employee satisfaction, there are still departments that are largely either unable, or unwilling, to improve either. Some departments are very spread out geographically, which drives a lot of meetings at night for US employees when having to collaborate with Asia, and often you will also have meetings early in the morning - bookending a very long workday. There is often some flexibility to take some time off during the day, but that will largely depend on your local management - again, your experience will be entirely dependent on your immediate managers and the VP and how they decide to run things. Same goes for the work culture, as mentioned, some departments have a very toxic culture of political scheming, other truly collaborate and pull-together - again your experience will be very different depending on where you are."}, {"review_title": "NA", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Feb 2023", "job_title": "IT Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Value for People, good work culture.

This may work fine for some departments where you have a very large and diverse group of workers but it falls apart when you have smaller groups of highly experienced and senior workers that on the average proform above expectations. To compound the problem the individual manager has no clue how his team or individuals on his team will fit into the overall distribution until the entire organization level sets at the end of the annual review cycle, thus that manager can't provide feedback throughout the year as to where in the distribution each person will end up. This rating impacts performance based bonuses by thousands or tens of thousands of dollars depending on your position in the company. This has been a big enough problem that employees have sued over it (do a Google search for more info on it).\n\nOverall Micron is a great place to work but the performance ranking system is pathetic and forces good strong leaders that hired a rockstar team to rank some of thier star workers as meeting expectations (3) to make space for weaker managers to have some 4s that may not be deserved.\n\nThere is also little consistency as to how the ratings are evaluated from manager to manger and year to year. One year or one manager will tell you that a 5 is a good sign that you are nearing being ready for promotion then the next year they will say that a 4 is the threshold for being promotion ready."}, {"review_title": "Pros and Cons", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Quality Engineer in Taichung", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working environment is good and have our own life, also have a lot of freedom in the office.", "cons": "bad management and people here tend to avoid issue"}, {"review_title": "best web design services ever", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Business Owner", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "best web design services ever", "cons": "nothing found till date ."}, {"review_title": "Excellent benifits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Systems Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "benefits, top time, salary tracking", "cons": "was assigned too many projects, slow to let poor productivity go."}, {"review_title": "Good place to work, gender equality, rapid technology upgrade", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Senior Data Engineer in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours, better exposure, respect for the individual", "cons": "hike percentage, benefits/perks are less compared to other product-based companies"}, {"review_title": "Good work life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work life balance in the company", "cons": "Located in India in two places alone, Hyderabad, Banglore"}, {"review_title": "Full time entry", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to learn in semiconductor area", "cons": "Headquarter is in rural area"}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Manufacturing Technician in Manassas, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- shift work, 3x on and 4x on alternates. \n- great company values \n- constant improvements\n- friendly security staff (from my experience)\n- good benefits", "cons": "- overworked for not much pay. you will go home drained...\n- many changes that legit do not make sense but ok.\n- issues with other areas that throw their work onto us because they simply \"don't have time' or \"don't want to do it'.\n- work/life balance is sort of non existent.
