In addition to the \"core curriculum\", each engineer can easily access high-quality training videos and courses for when additional skills are needed. - All the fellow engineers in my team are incredibly patient with me as I learn. They seek to be helpful, while also allowing me to answer questions on my own. They, and all the supervisors and managers, never talk down to me or treat me as though I am on a lower level. - You actually feel connected to the CEO and VPs and all other managers! Large Zoom meetings with these company leaders are a frequent occurrence, and they never talk down to us. They are always optimistic and encouraging. Despite how large the company is, I really feel like I know the leaders well. - The benefits and compensation are extremely generous and too numerous to name, but here are a few: free physical checkups annually, a Health Savings Account, generous 401(k) options, an on-site cafeteria that provides discount meals, an onsite gym, a team-building budget for every team, the option to work from home if that is preferred, move-in assistance from a professional realtor, and many other benefits! Overall, I've loved working here at Micron! It's given me so many opportunities to grow and expand my talents.", "cons": "- I was hired in the latter half of 2022, and the COVID-19 policy of Micron seemed far too restrictive and unscientific. Before being hired, I had to provide proof of vaccination. Despite being vaccinated, however, all employees were required to fill out a daily health survey, describing how we felt that day as well as other details. This daily survey, in addition to mandatory testing twice a week and masking when walking throughout the workplace, was an inconvenience that made the workplace less enjoyable. Please note: this policy is NO LONGER in place at Micron, being removed about a month after my hire, but it could possibly happen again in the case of another spike in COVID-19 or any other health situation deemed an emergency. Overall, this policy did not appear to respect the individual agency of thousands of bright, logical engineers who are capable of making well-informed decisions themselves, and it seemed to be more about signaling to the world how \"safe\" we were during the pandemic. - Particularly noticeable at the beginning of my hire (during the introductory trainings) was the company's focus on diversity. It made me feel like the company was making decisions based on the \"color of [the employees'] skin\", and other labels, rather than on the \"content of their character\"."}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Engineer in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lot of opportinuity that will keep you busy.", "cons": "The salary isn't that great compared to outside market."}, {"review_title": "1 star for the people and bosses, 1 star for pay.

Even though the higher up management is trying their best to improve on this by having meal subsidies, more gym facilities and also lesser off-hour triggers, but technically there is no work-life balance when it comes to work. OT is a norm despite no OT-pay as of late 2022 due to economic downturn (maybe will re-implement when things get better). Will get triggered in midnight/off-days if there are production concerns. Bad/wrong prediction on future outlook. Business Analysts and Higher Management has done a wrong prediction on short-term outlook which caused overflow in inventory and also over-hiring new employees which resulted in too slow response over economic recession period.
