NI gets 0%.\r\nLet's say you're a senior making 200K/year, if you're TC-A like myself it means you get 100K in RSU over 4 years, or 25K per year.

People just don't feel belong, except the executive management who still foolishly thinks they're building a great company that ppl are proud to work for.\r\n\r\nnature of work - work is so broken down, that one person just do a little bit of the entire project and you tend to do the same thing over and over again - because management does care little if you are happy to be working on what you're working on - they just want to get the job done and whoever is assigned to a task without a thoughtful consideration or taking into employee's wish into account.\r\n\r\ncareer track - middle management care less about your career track - first, there's little advancement, and they tried to nickle and dime you by delaying your promotion as long as they can.  The company treats each employee as a \"worker\", who \"completes a task and move onto the next assigned task\".  So there's little thoughts/process in place as to how one can advance.  There's little training provided, and there's no encouragement from the middle management to go for any kind of eternal training - after all, they just care that you finished what you've been assigned.\r\n\r\nbenefits - ever since the executive management mis-directed the company with poor product planning (way before the financial crisis of 2008 kicked in), they blamed everything on the economy, and used it as an excuse to cut every conceivable benefits possible: no more subsidized lunch, no more PTO, no more service award, no more tuition reimbursement, meagre RSU grant, salary cut  - everything done to save them face (cut cost to help improve bottom line) and demoralize everyone while not fixing the real issue.
