The middle management likes to form clique and sabotage others. While the middle management are engaging in their activities, the working level received most of the damage. While the school leaders said that they are open to listen to feedback, the feedback will always trickle down to the middle management, which resulted in collateral damage.\r\n\r\nThe school constantly requires staff to volunteer for students' activities. Although it is opened to all staff to volunteer, only designated staff who volunteered gets the work, others will get the flak from the middle management. These days the management are moving towards designating staff to do activities, rather than discussing with the staff.\r\n\r\nThere are no discussion with the staff on the career progression and direction one would like to head towards. The short meeting/discussion between the staff and the management is leaning towards informing for awareness. The staff could reject during the session, but will still have to do what is set out by the management. \r\n\r\nCompounding to the problem, the management favours master and PhD holders. Despite the school and MOE is educating the students of higher importance of working experience over paper qualification. Staff without them are at the mercy of those who have.\r\n\r\nAlthough the school is always saying they are doing things for the best interest for the students, many times the management are blindly following the rules and regulations rather than really helping the students. Weaker students might not get the help required unless stipulated by the system. Or unless the students are of value to the students, especially students who can represent the school in competition, etc.\r\n\r\nAs the education sector in Singapore is heading towards SkillsFuture, this is adding to the woes of the staff. Every academic staff have to teach in these courses, regardless whether you have the domain in the topic. On top of lacking in domain knowledge, staff are not paid as this is part of your work scope. Timetable scheduling might not be optimised due to special requirements from the senior staff. You could be teaching night classes today, and have 8am class the next morning. \r\n\r\nWhile NP is looking at reducing the headcount on yearly basis for the coming years, this make the situation worst as staff are more inclined to spend the least amount of time on the students in their academics, and more towards other highly valued activities by the management."}, {"review_title": "Good company very family friendly", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Senior Executive in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexi working hours, many perks.
