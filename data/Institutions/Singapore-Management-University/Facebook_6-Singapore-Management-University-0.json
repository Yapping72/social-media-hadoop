These are the offices to stay away from unless you can withstand the lots of gossip mongering, bad mouthing and lots of mistrust amongst the senior staff and junior staff. The office of alumni relations is one such example of an office that is not recommended to join. There is high turnover rate and there is indeed a blatant difference in the way work is accounted for and responsibilities are upheld between the senior people in the office and the newcomers. The middle managers are essentially super good actors that would put top actors and actresses to shame are very good at putting on a good front in front of the director but at the back, start spreading terrible comments of the newcomers. There is a lot of turf guarding and self-preservation in the office. There is no growth mindset in the office and the senior staff will always gang together and try their best to not allow the junior staff to succeed. You can survive here if you can somehow break into the circle of the senior staff.

The processes here can change on the fly without being formally informed to the team. Considered yourself lucky if you were informed about it. \n- Too many leaders but no leadership. \n- No sense of ownership or accountability within the team which makes the already confusing work place even more challenging to work in. \n- Calls are left without being put on break mode which causes it to be abandoned till it goes to the next available person. Issue was finally caught before I left the place. \n- No one actually follow up with their cases promptly therefore causing delays and complain by users and staffs. \n- No equal access to the Systems across all team members which make our efficient level drop. \n- Not wanting to train new hire even before the new hire was onboarded. One of the seniors went on a rant and decided to not be available on the week when the new hire was onboarded to avoid training them. \n- Using other colleague's name to sign off is a trend for some reason here. I've been caught in such situation multiple times and had to confront them accordingly. \n- Empowerment to make decision. Almost everything had to be checked again and again to confirm there\u2019s no change in process. Get\u2019s very annoying. \n- Trust is very much broken within the team which is the most annoying thing to happen. Do not always assume those who are newly hired into the team are inexperienced. It is not in your right to judge anyone who joins the team. \n- In summary, easily one of the most demoralising place to work because there's no sense of belonging or achievement here."}, {"review_title": "Excellent Place to Work For", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "21 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work-life balance, great empowerment", "cons": "Career progression is not very clear"}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Research Fellow in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible working time , nice working environment,", "cons": "No Cons comes to mind"}, {"review_title": "Forward Thinking Organisation", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "7 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Leaders make the consistent effort in ensuring relevancy", "cons": "Not at the moment thanks"}, {"review_title": "Good place to work at", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Undergraduate Student in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The part-time rate is very decent.", "cons": "Career progression may not be obvious."}, {"review_title": "Good work life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "27 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits and work culture is more family oriented.", "cons": "Slow Progression and too tedious performance appraisal system."}, {"review_title": "Worklife balance amidst limited progression", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Worklife balance and well spaced workload", "cons": "Limited progression without any education advancements"}], [{"review_title": "good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good good good good good", "cons": "nothing bad all is okay"}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Reynosa, Tamaulipas", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours for students who are good with operation", "cons": "Nothing much, a great place to learn"}, {"review_title": "SMU student helper", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great place to work at", "cons": "NIL.
