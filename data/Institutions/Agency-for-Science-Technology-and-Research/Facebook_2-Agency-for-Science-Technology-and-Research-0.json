Lack of intellectual curiosity by employees. There is a general apathy towards discussing scientific ideas, brainstorming, and providing sound critique to each other. This is essential for robust scientific research; however most people appear more keen to gossip & chat socially than engage in scientific discussions. \r\n\r\n2. Training for graduate students and junior postdocs is terrible. You are either neglected because your boss/mentor is too busy traveling and networking with others, or treated as part of an assembly line generating data for the lab without really understanding the bigger picture which the boss does not communicate. \r\n\r\n3. This is not a place which is scientifically vigorous. People often make big extrapolations of their data with very little or inappropriate controls.\r\n\r\n4. Postdoctoral fellows do not qualify for performance bonuses. Other neighbouring institutes get 1 to 3 months performance bonus (which can amonut to a good 5-figure sum), which we do not receive in GIS because the management feels that postdocs are \"trainees\".
