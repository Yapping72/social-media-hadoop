When it comes to complaints, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s fault but his. He is a control freak or should I say he loves controlling and abusing his authority. He insults and demean his staffs when things are not done to his satisfaction or at random when he feels like it. He enjoyed it. This abuse has been going on for years now. \r\n\r\nThere was one year, he sent separate emails to selected staffs and requested that we prepare and submit a full resume to him as if we were applying for a job. No he did not say for what purpose other than \u201cas if we were applying for a job\u201d. And he did not share anything after that. I will never forget that, because that was Christmas period where everyone was supposed to be enjoying their holidays but we (the affected ones) were left to worry if our jobs were at stake. That was during APA period. Is this HR protocol? Looking at your job history to determine your appraiser rating? I don\u2019t think so\r\n\r\nNow that telecommuting is a norm. There was one occasion when a staff accidentally activated the \u201crecord mode\u201d of the Skype conference we were in. He quickly intercepted and demanded to know who is recording and said \u201cyou want to trap me\u201d. Why would anyone say that? Well... it\u2019s easy to figure right\r\n\r\nI2r will be a better place without him. Anyway all Work are done by his direct reports. You don\u2019t need him ASTAR. ASTAR should really look into a 360 degree feedback, to give people like me a glimpse of hope to undo the injustice.\r\n\r\nI hate to admit it\u2019s pathetic to resort to this platform to sound the injustice.
