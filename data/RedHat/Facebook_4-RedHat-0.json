Additionally, the acquisition by IBM has led to some concerns about the potential for cultural changes that could negatively impact the company. Overall, it feels as though the focus on the bottom line has increased, leading to a feeling of being a small cog in a large machine. RedHat has a difficult legal policy on terminating employees and can be difficult to navigate. I have witnessed repeated mistakes being made without adequate disciplinary action being taken. As a result, many top engineers have left the team due to these issues, which can be a burden on the rest of the team.

Given that the company is so 'transparent' (another RH value) it's ironic that everyone's calendars are blocked and private, rearrange or don't turn up to meetings and that so many people can hide behind the new WFH culture - especially as there's no KPIs to outline whether people are/n't achieving. It's a very frustrating culture that people of my seniority or a role higher feel they are too busy to take certain meetings or to communicate down to their teams. \r\n\r\nIf you look at Red Hat competition you don't get this same culture and there is increased camaraderie within teams - reset and learning days don't compensate for authentic people. \r\n\r\nOnboarding is non existent compared to other companies and internal processes to try and get anything done e.g. it took me a week to ask for a copy of my work contract and six weeks to get licenses for any tools I need to do my job.

Rapidly expanded workforce consisting of just whoever HR could scrape up.

New teams get created to invent pipelines to solve problems they don't understand which then work terribly, become mandatory, and are decommissioned a year later to begin the cycle over again from the start. The ones making decisions behave like they're actively sabotaging the company. Old developers moved themselves into ivory tower positions where they effectively disappear. Paperwork, paperwork, and more paperwork is now the norm. Processes appear overnight, with a team of thirty new hires to manage and enforce them in ways that only serve to inhibit day-to-day work. Whether this is IBM's influence or simply the fate of all businesses, I cannot say.\r\n\r\nAs has been mentioned in other reviews, \"culture\" is fanatical a term that gets tossed around without any weight behind it.
