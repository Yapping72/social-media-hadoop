They have taken anything unique about Wells Fargo and made it generic. They have seriously missed an opportunity to rebrand the company and culture. They are toxic leaders and their dysfunction has permeated all management levels. No one knows how to properly execute or plan. Charlie and or Scott give an order and everyone runs to execute like chickens with their heads cut off. Neither leader offers any value outside of dictating what they want to happen and they expect it to happen no matter the cost. Upper management - especially in strategy (looking at you Rullah Price and Osana) and HR positions (Bei Ling is useless - she\u2019s just Scott\u2019s order taker and has zero personality or leadership presence) are crappy leaders as well. Their attitudes are toxic and they are overall not nice people to work with. They belittle, gossip, name call, and point blame at everyone but themselves. Public affairs isn\u2019t any better - it\u2019s the blind & deaf leading the blind leading color-blind below average leaders who are leading frustrated employees. The culture is not conducive to a healthy working environment. The type of jerk behavior that is allowed is absolutely astounding. I\u2019ve never witnessed so many people who treat others the way WF employees are allowed to treat each other. Seriously, DO NOT WORK for this company. You will sacrifice your mental health for pay that is subpar and raises that are nonexistent. \r\n\r\nInternal technology is a disaster as well. This company is one of the big four banks and uses outdated software or hires mediocre technology teams to create software in-house that is absolute crap. And any valuable third-party software that they do get is completely ruined through unnecessary customization to the point where the software no longer works as efficiently as it was originally intended to. I mean, it\u2019s 2022 and this company has yet to figure out how to be able to properly self publish an email or post to sites. They have entire FTE\u2019s whose full-time job is publishing, implementing (whatever that means) or managing a SharePoint site - such a waste of a valuable FTE who is desperately needed elsewhere in communications to execute actual work.\r\n\r\nPeople at Wells Fargo have a mediocre mentality. This is a company who will stunt your growth professionally. There is very little you will learn from the people you will with as well because all of the talent is leaving. \r\n\r\nNot sure why or how anyone is impressed with Charlie Scharf or Scott Powell - neither has a track record of any sort of impressive feat at any of the other companies they worked for.

Nearly everyone would like to see things improve, however few people actually like change in order to get there, and they definitely don't want change unless it means their stature or team grows. \n It's common to find a passive-aggressive streak, cloaked under supposed Midwest Niceness, which enables bad behavior by individuals such as saying they agree in public then sabotaging afterwards. A lot of situations where if people don't like something they find a way to drag it out through delays, rescheduled meetings, etc. etc. etc. that they hope it will just fade away, and unfortunately much of the time they are 'rewarded' and it does just fade away. Definite cliques based on geography, such as it's all about Des Moines, Iowa. I don't know how much of this is intentional and how much is subconscious, but there is a definite geographic bias from many people. The CEO thrives interacting with people in person and has established a mandate that there will be no more remote work once COVID restrictions end unless exception approval can be obtained from an operating committee member (i.e. 1 down from the CEO), which will be incredibly rare. This means that current employees who are not in a core location can no longer apply for jobs, even if they have been full time remote for years (they are not grandfathered in), and likely they will slowly be laid off over time (if they don't self-select out first, which saves the company money). This is going to result in a painful multi-year shift of strong talent out the door being replaced by mediocre talent in core locations, and less diversity in the non-branch workforce overall. While some work should be done in-office and site strategies can produce great benefit for customers and the company, they shouldn't be applied in a one-size-fits-all approach across an entire company."}, {"review_title": "Cashier", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 May 2022", "job_title": "Cashier in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good community and work culture", "cons": "Not the best management available"}, {"review_title": "They need to clean up their act big time.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in North Brunswick, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent benefits.

I also hadn't gotten a raise of any kind during my last couple of years w/ Wells. This is coming from someone who was constantly praised as a tOp PeRfOrMeR.\n\nMy experience is that most call center bankers wind up quitting because of burnout associated with the stress of dealing with angry customers 8+ hours a day or because they found something better externally. You know that thing they tell college freshman where you look to the left and to the right and the professor tells you that only one of the three of you will graduate? They should say something similar to new call center employees because a few months after starting a new role you may notice that a bunch of your coworkers have left and (hopefully) been replaced.\n\nI absolutely wouldn't call those who stick around \"misguided,\" but it can be extremely difficult to escape the phones. It's obviously possible, but I couldn't do it in 5 years! When you get asked during a job interview where you see yourself 5 years from now, do you respond with \"I see myself taking much harder phone calls for marginally better pay\"? I would hope not. That's more time than it would have taken me to go back to school and get a completely different bachelor's degree. \n\nThere were also people in a previous department that I worked in ~3.5 years ago that constantly complained about the job and were desperate to find ANYTHING off of the phones internally who were still there, doing the same thing, as of my last day.
