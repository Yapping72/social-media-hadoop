No sense of purpose in your job. Extremely micromanaged. \"Customer is always first\" mentality. Customer reviews do affect any extra income. For example, the majority of the time consumers will review Wells Fargo as a whole negatively and not their actual bank service experience so you never get bonuses with negative reviews. Most banks are starting to become short-staffed in order to increase mobile engagement with customers. The problem with fewer workers at a bank creates frustration with the customers that come in for help as well as problems with the workers. I knew a teller who could not get time off for her mother-in-law's funeral. There was another bank in my region where a teller passed out in front of the customers and eventually died.
