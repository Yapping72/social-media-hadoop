Expectations doubled during the pandemic after sending everyone to WFH.  Instead of one account successfully opened per day, we were expected to have two. If you take four customers all the way from step 1 to credit check and 3 fail credit check, you are only recognized for completing the 1 account that passed. So the other 3 accounts you spent several hours on, only to get declined? Tough luck, you do not receive any credit for those. The expectation is you better get one approved before end of day.\n\nTerrible managers that always push numbers. Nothing has changed since the fake account scandals except for lip service. \n\nUnless you are a senior employee, you will struggle to get PTO approved.

Prepare to explain why you had to use the restroom outside of the two allotted 15 minute breaks.\n\nThere are some good people here but they typically do not last very long. It is a soul crushing job and they (management) will slowly break your will.\n\nRules and procedures change constantly. Took PTO and missed one of the 18 updates while you are out? Better read it in the 10 minutes you have before shift starts or you risk a critical QA error. \n\nConstant supervision and Micromanaging - Not an exaggeration to say they have a TL or Manager checking over everything you do. One checks your email folders, one checks your Excel spreadsheets even though its only used to help you stay organized, one checks to see if you sent out DocuSign requests on time, etc. \n\nWhen you do make a mistake (and you will) be prepared to be put on blast. They love to CC every single manager and senior leaders that you will never speak to, just to make a point. It can be over the silliest and easiest mistake to fix as well.

Had an employee appreciation week where upper management gave us boxes of cookies and Wells Fargo notebooks to show their appreciation and it felt very stilted, especially as this happened directly after many people in the district left. It felt like more of a \"please don't leave\" than a genuine gesture. Every single branch was either running a skeleton crew or closed for not enough people working there. We were coached to tell customers that we were short staffed because of the labor shortage, but what was considered \"fully staffed\" was 2 people more than we had, and that would still have been a stressful work environment, especially for new people. People didn't leave to go live off of government benefits-- as a few customers inferred when I explained our short staffing-- they left for better opportunities. When they raised the minimum pay to 20/hr for tellers and 21/hr for bankers, many people were raised to the minimum only, and even people who had worked there for many years only got raised to one dollar more an hour. Every part of every process (loans, mail, calling another department) takes a bit longer than it did even a year ago. Concerning work-life balance, I do have to either take a day off or go on lunch for many errands. I cannot afford to buy a starter home in my area with my pay, but who can?  I was told as a general rule at one point that we should not schedule things for after work because it is possible we will be there until after 6 each night. However, I can leave work at work and not worry about doing anything while I am out (minus the emotional damage from customers who use customer service people as a place to dump all of their frustration and the revelation that humanity can be atrocious, but that is the standard for customer service). In my time here, I have observed that the usual turnover is 3-5 years.

They do not understand the mortgage industry and always try to rely on WF brand that has been in the news for the past 7 years. \r\n\r\n3. Supervisors most of them are new. They were home mortgage consultant for less than a year and they were promoted to supervisors due to the 2020 volume. They are kids, set unrealistic goals and expectations. They get offended easily and have zero emotional intelligence. \r\n\r\n4. QA. Wells Fargo has a quality assurance team that monitors your calls. They listen to your calls and try to ding you so you lose your bounce to minimize the department spendings. (VERY SKETCHY) it\u2019s impossible to negotiate with the QA team and most of their reviews are false!\r\n\r\n5. Loyalty. Customer surveys. Most of the surveys you receive are not even about you as an HMC. Customers are always complaining about the operation department ( loan processors, Underwriter, and closers) because they sent the borrowers the wrong documents or they were not easy to get in touch with or they were unprofessional and delayed the process. Major problem that department is facing right now so their operations team and HMC always provide feedback to the site leader and and sales managers and they immediately say they cannot do anything. This result in not getting you loyalty bonus because simply are people are not willing to do their job.\r\n\r\n6. Convenience. While other lenders were closing loans in 45 days Wells Fargo was taking 120 days to close a loan in 2020. In 2021 Wells Fargo was still taking 90 days to close a loan after escalating the file million times to management to help the operations team to do their job. \r\nIn 2022 they started closing loans in 45 days after the marked died out.
