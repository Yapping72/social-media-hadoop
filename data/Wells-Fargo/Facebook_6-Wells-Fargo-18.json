Quite a few middle managers are incompetent (e.g. don't know much about the area they are managing, and are not leaders who advocate for their direct reports) and consequently they feel threatened by their competent staff.  Managers' reviews and workloads are not scrutinized.  Middle managers are not trained and hence are awful at managing or serving as advocates for their team.  They tend to be good at managing up. WF doesn't routinely do 360 reviews, and places an inordinate emphasis on the direct manager's review, which lends itself to abuse. People are rarely given advancement opportunities internally. Nearly all promotions are given to outsiders. Many of the middle managers are hired from other companies.  \r\n\r\nThe mindset of most successful lawyers here is \"risk averse\" so most lawyers have a certain CYA factor in them.  It is not uncommon to hear lawyers now say \"that  decision is above my pay grade\" whereas the phrase used to be \"run it like you own it.\"  There is a lot of emphasis on process and asking questions, less emphasis on being productive. If you do make risk conscious productive decisions that help your clients move forward, your clients will love you but you won't be rewarded for it most of the time in the law department because no one pays attention to productivity here.\r\n\r\nMy observation is that most lawyers after working at WF could not work in a more risk embracing company. \r\n\r\nMany lawyers work with their doors closed all day, even working through lunch, and then they go home to families.  It is like the civil service. People who come here \"ride it out through retirement.\"  The offices are dull and morgue like.  No one really talks, except on the phone with other people on conference calls, or when you run into them in the kitchen or bathroom, or the occasional diversity lunch (which is usually run by secretaries and paralegals) or at the holiday lunch.  If you're young or young at heart, have ambitions, are animated, or extroverted, and full of life, don't come here, unless of course you want to use it as a stepping stone for something better for you.

Employees were motivated to perform, they wanted to perform and meet their goals. It wasnt the retail banking culture of today where every customer \"needs\" a product sold to them and employees salaries and performance reviews are almost entirely based on their sales results. Employees were Engaged!", "cons": "I believe there were two major issues that slowly lead to my dis-engagement with WF and ultimately was the reason why I left the bank. The first reason is they began to promote and hire people into management positions that didnt have any banking background.  These managers were college graduates with business MBA's but didnt have any banking background and the numbers started to reflect it.  Good managers have sound judgement and make good business decisions when dealing with customers on a day to day basis. Without a banking background and having that on the job training of what to look for when accepting deposits from customers or cashing large checks for non-customers the bank began to take huge losses from fraud.  Good managers have great common sense when it comes to managing risks and thats something that isnt taught in a classroom. With that in mind, because with substanial number of losses the bank was taking, managers across the board were punished.  Even if your branch didnt have losses almost all authority was taken away from the branches and it even got to the point that if a customer needed NSF fees waived in excess of $100, it had to be approved by a district manager. Experienced managers became glorified personal bankers.  Imagine this, \" I understand you had fraud on your account and accrued several overdraft fees. Due to the amount it has to be approved by a district manager and you should see a credit to your account whithin a day or two.\" Sounds insane coming from the managers mouth and that doesnt even go into deposits, wires, or check cashing.  The second major issue was the increase in sales/referral goals.  The incentive plans were always changing and the goals kept increasing and increasing to the point that making a bonus was almost unattainable for most employees.  When I began with the bank being a \"5 Star\" sales employee and getting invited to the luncheons meant a teller needed to attain 120 referrals in a quarter. They counted checking, savings, loans, direct deposit, on-line banking, bill-pay, and NEW visa debit cards sold as referrals.  Personal Banker incentive plans were more complicated but although the goals were high, they were attainable.  Slowly they began taking away what counted as a qualified referral and soon all that counted was checking accounts, savings accounts, closed loans, and direct deposit that were processed through an active checking account.  After awhile employees werent receiving bonuses, getting the recognition, and all they were able to do was meet was minimum standards so they could keep their jobs.  Everyone understands that there is always a need for improvment and if you dont push yourself further you never get from \"good' to 'great\", I think that in always pusjing their employees for more and always striving for excellence  Wells Fargo forgot one of the biggest rules in business, their people are their competative advantage, and they are loosing their advantage everyday."}, {"review_title": "Technology Manager", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Apr 2010", "job_title": "Technology Manager in Charlotte, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wells Fargo has much to offer to it employees in terms of benefits, work life balance, and commitment to it's employees.", "cons": "The compnay is very large and you can get lost in the shuffle.

But there are over a quarter million employee's so there are bound to be a few bad apples.  The Pro is, if you findyourself unhappy you can always transfer someonewhere else and you will find that the management is different, the culture is different, the sales pressure is different.  I've worked for Wells Fargo in 3 states which were in 3 different regions.  The banking was the same in each one,  The culture was totally different.  3rd time's the charm, I've found the perfect fit for me.\r\n\r\nBenifits:\r\n-6% matching in 401k.  That beats the industry average of 3%.  I haven't found a bank that comes close.\r\n-Health/Dental/other benifits: On par with the best of banks out there.\r\n-Industry high of at least 4 weeks paid vacation 5 weeks for managment\r\n\r\nTechnology:\r\n-Some of the most upgraded/high tech/user friendly/paperless processes in the industry.  Documents are not kept in old file cabinets, they are scaned and stored online.  Account opening is not done on paper like at US BANK, it is done on the computer with a digital signiture pad.  This is all important because it makes your job easier.\r\n\r\nPay:\r\nIt is right on par with the industry.  Look at other Banks on this website, the pay is about the same anywhere you go.\r\n\r\nAdvancment:\r\nIf you are willing to relocate you can move up almost as fast as you want.

If you are in the wronge store at the wrong time you won't get a good pay out.\r\n-annual raises are 3-5%\r\n\r\nSales pressure:  Sales pressure varries by state and market.
