In it he stated that he expected those results to maintain and/or go up, even once everyone began to return to the office. Now (at least in my department) we have WFH implemented, but it's on a weekly rotating schedule (e.g., 1 week in, 1 week at home), while some departments do 3 days in the office and 2 days at home each week. I guess it's nice that they are allowing it now, but when outside circumstances that you have no control over arise during your in-office week or day, you are not allowed to work from home, even though we successfully did it for the past 2+ years. Now, if you're not feeling well (but you're able to work still), or if an unforeseen emergency arises, you MUST use a PTO day, which really sucks because the PTO and Sick Time buckets are the same, so it feels like you're being punished for not coming in to an office site when you are fully capable of actually doing the work. This wouldn't apply to all employees obviously, just those who have WFH capabilities. \n\nPlease believe me when i say Wells Fargo is VERY strict/tyrannical with respect to WFH. Had it not been for the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of employees wouldn't have ever had the chance to WFH, but the pandemic literally forced the company to shift and make it possible. I'm a salaried employee with no client interaction at all, so there is literally no reason for me to be in an office. Just yesterday I had an emergency on the freeway while on my way to work, and was ultimately not able to get to the office. I called my leader, updated them on everything, and even stated I could provide proof so that they knew I was not taking advantage of anything.

Similar to what led to the fake account scandal, managers are using high pressure tactics on mortgage loan underwriters to produce more loans, tying incentives to production to make them underwrite and approve more and threatening to fire employees if they don\u2019t meet the goals. Goals are unrealistic and a very small percentage of workers are able to meet these goals (1.3 loans per day while managing 30 to 50 plus files monthly). Many underwriters than compromise quality to rush through files by cutting corners in hopes they don\u2019t get audited. As long as the bank can sell these loans to investors, the company does not care about anything else. Meetings are held almost on a daily base to continue the pressure for underwriters to be faster with their loan decisions.

Staffing is cut to the bone and existing staff is strongly encouraged to push customers to alternative options to in branch banking, whether they want it or not.\nThey've slashed bonuses at the branch level and changed the match in our 401k to December 15th of the year so that if someone leaves the company prior to then the company won't pay its share of the 401k match for that year. \nCorporate leadership lacks any kind of unique vision with the company strategy now being \"do it just like Chase and B of A.\" I've been with Wells Fargo for a long time. I was a banker back in the dark days of sales pressure. It was almost better then - at least we knew who we were. Customers could walk in and get immediate banker assistance most of the time. Now our staffing is such that we're virtually by appointment only. Now, the message from corporate is that if a client doesn't have 250k then they really aren't a priority for us. The 250k + client is exactly who I'm supposed to work with but in the process of turning our branches into an inhospitable place for normal people, that's splashing onto the high value clients because they don't walk in the door with a tag that says \"I'm rich.\" \nManagement has started requiring branch employees to take an online class about the importance of caring for clients. 2 hours a year to counteract the other 2000 hours where their message is \"meh, don't care too much.\" The sociopaths in our executive suite don't realize that normal humans are genetically coded to care about each other. The class is a seriously grim joke.\nIf they could fire us all tomorrow and replace us with robots they would."}, {"review_title": "Just a number, no employee appreciation.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Small Business Banker in Charlotte, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay & Benefits.

The good ones stood out like stars in the nght sky and folks fought to get on their teams. Senior management in STL or NY (now) have no idea what goes on with their employees because the employees are too afraid to speak up. In the instances where you do, the department managers gloss over any issues and support inept front line managers because they are all following directives from the top down. HR is ridiculous. You have to send a message on the intranet and hope for a response or call the 877 line and wait on hold over an hour to actually reach a person- who is clueless abou YOUR department, location or anything specific about what you're dealing with. Ridiculous they don't have local or regional HR reps. Departments are restructured regularly ( leading to aforementioned fear of losing job) In whole its a toxic environment. The saddest part is the \"lifers\" ( those who have been there 12-20 plus years- either don't realize it or accept it.

Management was aware the entire department in our city would be laid off, yet made no provisions for us to train our replacements until 2 or 3 weeks- before we left.
