It's always bugged me that they call tellers \"sales positions\" when they aren't. Tellers are the middle-men between a banker and a sale. There is no way for a teller to make a direct sale and all referrals must be sent to a banker, the banker must contact the customer, and the customer must agree and have time to come in to make the sale final. After all this, the teller might not get credit for the sale because another teller might have tracked a customer 45 days or less before the other teller, thus credit goes to the first teller to ever track the customer, regardless of the reasoning behind each teller's tracking. The biggest issue is Wells Fargo beating to death their tellers with sales when they can't make sales themselves, it all has to be referred to someone else to close anything."}], [{"review_title": "Will always love Wells.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Teller in San Bernardino, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working at WF can be bittersweet but more good than bad, in my opinion.

Depending on what branch your placed at, sales can be harder to come by at slower branches.

Not bad pay, but definitely should get more for what you have to do & deal with. Start at 11.33/hr then go up to 11.50 after about 30 days. Then raises are annually. \r\nYour loss policy!

First off, you learn a lot about finances just from talking to your bankers. This is beneficial, because you'll be able to apply it to your personal finances and start exercising healthy spending and saving habits. Second, they promote from within. Wells Fargo is more inclined to promote someone who has started as a teller, as opposed to someone who worked started at chase, and trying to move to become a personal banker. Next, the benefits are a HUGE pro. Even as a part-time teller, you get PTO. Moreover, if you're a student, Wells Fargo will help with tuition reimbursement as along as your major is in a field which could benefit the company. A minor pro - depending on who and what branch you are at - is that we get weekends off.", "cons": "Unfortunately, not all companies are perfect. As a direct result of the fraudulent accounts scandal, customers will come in just to yell at you for things that are out of your hands. There's been many times that my branch has hd customers expressing their displeasure - and rightfully so. Also another con is that in order to move up in the company, you must be at your position for roughly one year.

We had 4-5 bankers in a branch that rarely had any customers wanting to sit down with somebody. Unattainable hurdles that required lying and deception. They'd say stuff like \"you're not helping enough customers\" which means you're not opening a bunch of stuff customers don't want. Micromanaged by the hour, and overall just a nightmare of a place to work. We had an 8:30 huddle, then a 10, 12, 2 and 4:30 call to report our numbers.

I think the biggest problem with working for Wells Fargo is that Information Technology is broadly defined as an \"expense\" rather than as an opportunity for innovation.  Because it is defined as an expense, senior executives don't understand the potential value.  Here's an example:  Does it matter that real-time-balances aren't available online? Of course! It matters to customers because they'd like to have it - but it matters to management because they don't see the value, only the expense of providing it.

The systems are slow and outdated. The entire process at the branch seems archaic. It is near impossible to reach all of your threshold goals, much less your payout goals. Management does not care about you. Nearly all of the managers are women who act like they have something to prove. Instead of being helpful, management belittles you with every chance they can get. Promises that were made when the job was initially offered have not been fulfilled. My entire experience at this company has been terrible. I am miserable and dread waking up in the morning knowing that I have to go to work for this company. The benefits are not very good, not to mention expensive. Service doesn't matter, only sales. You are told to do what's best for the customer, but if you don't open a new account you will hear it from your manager, even if it's not what is best for the customer. Fees are charged on everything and it is very hard to have your manager reverse any, even if there is a legitimate reason. Underwriting is terrible to work with. There's not much you can do in a branch; it seems you need to call for just about any real issue, defeating the whole purpose of the branch.

The management team in my department treated us like children, even though most of us had extensive experience in the work force. There was no training on the processes when most of us came on board, and processes were constantly changing with no training on the new processes, so we had to figure them out on our own. Then when management didn't like what we did, we would get chastised for it and penalized. There were constant threats and intimidation tactics used, and unrealistic weekly deadlines. There were also threats of senior management taking away the work-from-home flexibility, even though it worked very well for most of us. Most of us were working a lot of unpaid overtime, and there was no flexibility in our work hours, even though we did not work with the general public.

Employee turnover is either high (sales field) or low (back office).  For the low turnover departments, there seems to be a limited number of senior level positions so a title promotion might not be available until a senior level retires.  Although the job site appears to have an increasing amount of openings, the current HR process is weeding out quality performers, which makes it difficult even for internal candidates to get interviews.

First message: give your time and money (if you can) back to the community by volunteering and donating.  The corporate HQ puts the shareholders money where their mouth is by giving employees two days off every year to volunteer and they will match your donations to non-profit organizations.
