It should be noted that these points apply to Anti-Money Laundering only.\r\n\r\nManagement has been moving forward with a plan, despite widespread criticism at the investigator level, to move all teams to a 5 days in office/5 days working from home plan.  This plan would be so rigid as to force you to use your own PTO if you were unable to be in the office or work from home on your assigned week.  Our team has repeatedly been misled, beginning with our initial interviews, on the leniency of the company's work from home policy.  As our team has bounced between leaders, each has arbitrarily raised the required minimum days remaining on cases in our queue to prevent us from working remotely.  Leadership has also repeatedly dangled the prospect of across the board promotions to all Financial Crimes Consultant 2 team members to FC 3, however, as this has been in talks for over a year, and we are in yet another hiring freeze, this appears to be just another tall tale.  \r\n\r\nThere appears to be little to no room for advancement in Philadelphia, as financial crimes compliance is frequently subject to hiring freezes, and they appear to be pushing to remove us physically from the building based on the above working from home plan.\r\n\r\nThis theme of arbitrary leadership decisions is a problem across all aspects of our work, and is exacerbated by the clear lack of industry knowledge and proper priorities for compliance investigations groups at all levels of management on the East Coast, but particularly at the manager and director level.  Wells Fargo's program requires each and every case to be scrutinized by your direct manager, who often apply their own questionable nitpicks to what should be a streamlined, consistent production-based environment.  Some managers have next to no financial crimes experience, knowledge of company systems, or leadership skills.  If you are used to any autonomy in your investigative work, you will hate it here.  This is the only investigative group I've been a part of where the managers have no cases of their own to complete, and are essentially QR (even though there is an actual QR with much more lenient standards as they service all teams). \r\n\r\nThese huge inconsistencies between teams are the result of an overall lack of written policies and procedures I had never encountered in a compliance program before coming to Wells Fargo.  What little written guidance there is is often supplemented by verbal updates from leadership with questionable understanding of the issues at hand, and often are never even added in writing to the compliance manuals.  Teams with the same pay grade, investigative mandates, and case loads are hugely inconsistent across the company to a level I had not though imaginable.  This can mean the difference between one team only having to review a single account for a month time span, with another team for the same referral having to review 20 accounts over a year.  There appears to be an established culture of managers and directors with no real productive casework to do, who are encouraged to add their own anal guidelines for their respective teams down the chain.  Every single policy change I have seen, at the director or manager level, has consisted of them adding more work for us to do, or curtailing our privileges.  It is especially insulting having compliance experience in mature programs and knowing that these changes are never actually the result of guidance stemming from the federal government or an audit, but middle managers seeking to appear more strict and thorough than the next, as they view our teams as another stepping stone to move up.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia morale remains low as our teams are again and again subject to rules which we see our colleagues in other regions, lucky enough to be under qualified leadership, not have to deal with.  Management holds us to the quantitative standards of a high volume production environment, and appears unable to create efficient processes to succeed with that level of case work.  Our case load has increased unbelievably in our time, from what was an expected 3 cases completed per day, to what is now 5.  It is impossible to conduct in depth reviews given that volume yet managers constantly push for more to be completed.  We feel that we are always bearing the burden of management's lack of planning which caused this situation, as we are constantly understaffed, and see arbitrary priority level escalations, new monitoring referral sources, and ill-conceived policies be implemented every day."}, {"review_title": "I never had high blood pressure before working here", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Home Mortgage Consultant in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits are good, however you don\u2019t make enough for the copays or meds that you probably need.

There are also a great number of talanted and smart people who work for wells fargo, unfortunatley none in retail banking.  Wells Fargo's private bank, commercial banking, WF investment and other specialized business units stand out in the banking industry and truly do add value to their clients.\r\n\r\nAt the least, you will be able to get some experience, perhaps a professional license which you can use to find a job somewhere else, or get a job outside of WF retail.\r\n\r\nBenefits and pay are average.  Although recruiters will try to dress them up to make it seem like you are getting more, but when it comes down to it benefits and pay are just average compared to other companies in the same industry.", "cons": "First of all let me state that I work for Wells Fargo Retail, and that when I list all the negative aspects at working for Wells Fargo they mainly pertain to retail banking and Wells Fargo Financial.  \r\n\r\nThe worst thing about working at Wells Fargo is the complete lack of ethics, which is a detriment to customers and the organization it's self.   Unrealisticly high sales goals, combined with constant threats from branch and district managers force bankers to manipulate customers, falsificate documents and violate customer rights and privacy just to feel like they can avoid being fired for underperformance.   Altough branch and District Managers are well aware of all the unethical sales practices they look the other way and passivley encourage this behavior by promoting bankers based mostly on sales perforamce, regardless of how it was attained.   When a banker is fired for sales manipulation, the unethical sales are still honored towards meeting the branch manager and district manager's goals, which means that managment does only benefits and activley seeks to maintiain a staff with no sales ethics.\r\n\r\nAs a result, often times Wells Fargo customers get pushed or manipulated into products and services which they do not need, and end up paying uneccessary fees or even having their credit history negativley impacted.  Also, Wells Fargo the company looses out because eventually customers loose faith in the company and they sacrifice quality relationships for a large quantity of accounts. \r\n\r\nThe second negative aspect to working at Wells Fargo is the lack of career development and opportunity for promotion.  Years ago, this was not the case, however these days managment and other higher level positions in Orange County are given only to friends, family and top producers who often lack the matiruity, experience and business sense for the resposnibilites which they are given.  It is not uncommon that relatives of executives will get placed in prime locations or promoted extremley quickly when compared to people with more experience and skill.  District managers, sales directors, market presidents and so on, surround themselves and promote only people who never question thier ideas or tactics.  Consequently, when a new initiative or sales process is issued from the corporate office, nobody has the courage to point out that it may be redundant, inefficient or ineffective out of fear of being branded as a \"non-believer\" or a non-team player.   \r\n\r\nThe third major drawback of working for Wells Fargo is staffing.  To get a job as a banker there is only one requirement: you must we willing to do anything to exceed the sales goals, (including forcing your friends and family to sign up for products and services they do not need).  Branches are very overstaffed on the sales side and understaffed on the service side, which makes for some interesting work enviorments.  Also, Wells Fargo does not put any stock in education or personal characteristics, such as professionalism, intelligence, etc.  It seems like more and more new bankers istead of being college graduates are past cell phone sales reps and mortgage industry drop outs.  It is a disservice to clients to have an employee give advice about personal finaces who does not even understand the concept of time value of money, or even worse sell investment which they do not understand."}, {"review_title": "Good first job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 Jan 2010", "job_title": "Credit Manager in Bellevue, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It's a good place to learn basic sales skills\r\nThey offer great benefits and bonus incentives\r\nGood upper level management", "cons": "Prepare to be micromanaged\r\nThe pay is only good if you meet the monthly criteria of product goals, which in this economy isn't the easiest thing to do."}], [{"review_title": "Wells Fargo - Slow and painful", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 May 2010", "job_title": "Project Manager II in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They don't work very hard so its an easy gig\r\nThere is alot of work with the Wachovia merger\r\nFridays are a ghost town\r\nThe bar is set low", "cons": "Managers aren't very good listeners\r\nMany pointless meetings\r\nStruggling to manage an initiative the size of the Wachovia merger"}, {"review_title": "It could be better for retail store.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good on resume.\r\nThere are different career pathes be choosed.\r\nThe company still has protencial to develop, like being as international bank.", "cons": "The WOW survey is extremeness but not accurate.\r\nSolutions, solutions and solutions!\r\nThe strategy of sales goals make bankers act as sales more like pros."}, {"review_title": "Employees Treated like Criminals", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Jul 2010", "job_title": "Bank Teller in Rochester, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great oppurtunity to move up within the company\r\nAwesome bonus for sales\r\nLots of PTO\r\nLots of banking knowledge", "cons": "Employees are not trusted\r\nHorrible sympathy for personal issues\r\nGetting screamed at by customers because of bank fees\r\nSchedule makes it hard to do anything else in life\r\nSooooo many complicated rules"}, {"review_title": "It's OK...", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Aug 2010", "job_title": "Teller", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Starting pay: 10.25/hr\r\nGood Benefits\r\nGreat atmosphere on teller line", "cons": "Asked to do asinine things daily\r\nThe things you need to say to customers become increasingly ridiculous the longer you work there\r\nManagement is promoted purely on sales, therefor most of them lack any capacity for leadership and are not given any incentive to grow.

Anyone who has even the tiniest speck of decency or integrity flowing through their veins has to feel uncomfortable at this job. This is not a customer service job. Your job as a phone banker is to \"service the call as quickly as possible so you can refer the client to sign up for another product or service.\" Even if the client finds themselves near a negative balance seemingly every day, your team leads and supervisors will tell you to get them to agree to speak with a \"specialist\" (sales rep) about opening up a credit card or another checking account (or many other products and services). The problem is, Wells Fargo is a rich person's bank. Wells Fargo has no basic free account. You have to meet multiple requirements each month in order to keep the account \"free.\" Whether that is maintaing direct deposits totaling $750 a month, 10 debit card transactions, $2,000 daily balance, linked Wells Fargo home mortgage, etc etc. Most people nowadays can't satisfy these requirements, which in turn gets their account monthly service fees. Yet, here your team leads and supervisors are saying you should get these people over to sign up for ANOTHER checking account they can't afford, or a credit card. They will tell you that it is the best thing for the client, when in reality you are coercing them to make a horrible financial decision because Wells Fargo upper management wants to profit in ANY WAY possible. \r\n-your daily sales goals require a 25% referral rate, which means you gain permission from the client to make a sales pitch. As long as they don't say \"no,\" you get to track it. Also, a 10% warm transfer to a specialst. This means you've gotten permission from the client to make a pitch, and then you also get them to agree to speak directly with someone about signing up for the product. The trainers, team leads, and supervisors will tell you that these aren't hard numbers to achieve. Because your referral rate is only 1 out of every 4 calls, and your warm transfer is 1 out of every 10 call. Seems simple enough. The problem is, you can get 7 people in a row just wanting their balance, ghost calls, angry customers who don't want to hear it, and then all of a sudden you are 10 calls behind. Then to make matters worse, you get emails and visits from management asking why your numbers are low. The demand from management and customers will have you wanting to quit every single day. They will tell you that if you tough it out, you will get a big incentive payout which is quarterly. Yet that is practically unattainable. In fact, the incentive payout you receive for your sales numbers is only a QUARTER of what Wells actually profited. \r\n-every aspect of your life is monitored when you are at work, which will make you feel like you are in a prison. Your break and lunch times are set up by a computer. Literally every second you are off the phone is kept track of. \r\n-all in all, once you have worked this job even for just a short amount of time, you will begin to see just how Wells Fargo has really set up policies that are completely NOT client-centered. Fee waivers are a joke, no legitimate and simple free accounts exist, constant gaming to meet sales goals deprives clients of information they need to know in order to avoid fees, etc etc. This is a rich person's bank, and we know that 99% of their clientelle don't fit that demographic. If you have any shred of decency, compassion, and integrity, you will begin to hate yourself for what you do every day, and Wells Fargo in general. This may seem very intense, but I literally believe you should not believe any of the good reviews this position has received. The only times you are able to truly \"help\" a client is on Wells Fargo's terms.

You basically have to become best friends with management in order to be granted access to the \"Home Team\" they call it. Aside from that, you are only going to fund a max of 5 loans per month. Which they only pay you $300/loan. If you have a call monitor and you miss 1 piece on the 2 random calls per month, your bonus for call quality goes out the window. \r\nThey have it set up to where if you fund 1 -2 loans they pay you $200. 3-6 loans they pay you $300 on purchase transactions. If you have 100% application quality, and 100% call quality, they multiply your bonus by 40% for each piece. (40% for calls, 40% for app quality) so you could potentially make $540/loan. however they mark you off for absolutely everything and it is near impossible to hit. Just a heads up, base your expected income off making $300/loan. \r\nThey also have a rotating saturday and sunday shift. So there is a potential you could be scheduled to work 12 days in a row. I busted my butt working there, working 50hr weeks, taking 30min lunches and did everything management wanted and never got placed on the home team, or had the ability to do jumbo loans.

I helped people with navigating and using the website and was able to help a lot of people. I felt very ethically uncomfortable while working as a online services specialist here because you were expected to attempt to sell extra products (Loans, Accounts, Credit Cards, Insurance, etc) to the members you helped on every single call. Wells Fargo believes in wanting to ensure their customers financial success... with them. This means that they feel the more products a customer has with them, the less likely they will be willing to leave the bank and go to another competitor. This includes offering credit products to members who you can see are living paycheck to paycheck and can't afford to apply for more credit. Members who may not have a good credit score and need to work on their credit, but to send them over to a salesman to apply for a credit product that may show up on their credit report as an inquiry and not be approved for it. You don't have to get those hard sales, but are expected to do what's called \"soft sales\" and gauge customer interest and if they say it's something that they would be interested in or they could see benefitting them, then you were expected to get them over to a salesman. If they were unable to talk to a salesman at the current time, then you were to mark that they were interested so they could be asked about the product again next time they call in. I didn't feel it was acceptable to offer products to people that didn't need them, especially if they were only calling in for help with using the website. On top of the sales, Well Fargo charges outrageous fees to their customers for almost everything under the sun (They even have a fee of $12.95 for moving money from your savings to your checking for you which is called a Overdraft Protection and most credit unions offer that service for free.) and then when they have customers that are truly struggling and could use the $15-20 they charged for a fee, they refuse to refund the fees. I had to plead with managers to refund fees for me when I had customers who were struggling and my heart felt for them so much. You have to be a really cold person to work at Wells Fargo for so long and not feel like you're contributing negatively to people's lives. After quitting my job here from the toll it took on my mental health (and physical because I gained 30 lbs in the 8 months I worked here from stress eating at work since that's the only thing you can do while on the phone,  I cancelled all accounts with Wells Fargo and recommended to all my friends and family to do the same because this company does not care about it's customers unless you carry above $500,000 in your accounts. They only look out for the wealthy and everyone else is a drop in the bucket to them. If you need a job and have no other options, I would recommend applying, but I would honestly recommend working in fast food before working here because that's how emotionally, mentally, and physically draining this place can be."}, {"review_title": "hard to move up - boys club", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-good benefits\r\n-work-life balance\r\n-good training\r\n-organization feels like family", "cons": "-little to no room for growth\r\n-pathetic bonus and salary increase\r\n-boys club\r\n-little to no diversity\r\n-difficult to become successful unless you're in sales"}, {"review_title": "I would give it a negative 5 if I could.

I enjoyed the money handeling and helping customers with their problems, but that is not what Wells Fargo is interested in from a teller now days.  They simply want someone that will sell their products to every customer.  Often times the Assistant Manager will sit behind the teller line and watch your interaction with each customer.  If you do not offer the products like the computer prompts you too, the manager will be pulling you aside to give you \"tips\" and \"suggestions\" on how to sell these 'products\" to the customer.  \r\n\r\nThe manager at our branch always wanted us to pitch customers credit cards under the guise that using a credit card instead of using savings will help you to \"save your money!\"  I mean why use your savings when you could just charge up your credit card and then pay the bank more if fees, yea!!!  \r\n\r\nI couldn't stomach the high pressure sales environment that is the culture at Wells Fargo, so I left.  Also, the pay is horrendous.  I believe I could have made more money working at a fast food restaurant.

Especially if you enjoy helping others or like to sell.\r\n\r\n As mentioned above, the bonus is a joke. It's only paid out once a quarter if you qualify. YOU HAVE TO MEET RIDICULOUSLY HIGH ACHIEVEMENTS TO GET IT) but if hired all the supervisors/coaches talk like its the easiest thing in the world. I found out much later that's because the supervisors (not coaches) get a commission if you get the bonus. On top of higher pay and not having to answer phones, they get a bonus is you get a bonus, even though you did all the work for 3 months. Just let that sink in for moment....\r\n\r\nAs with any call center environment, you have QAs. These affect your bonus. Too many bad ones in the 3 month period and no bonus. This would be ok if the criteria didn't change, but it does, every couple weeks. For example one week you can give the customer his/her username, next you can't and you're dinged on QA for giving it the prior week. Had this happen to me, was told  \"oh well, you'll do good on the next one I'm sure!\"\r\n\r\nAll of this would still be ok, except for the random surveys they have customers fill out. It is company policy to get a mandatory 5 out 5 stars on these surveys. CUSTOMERS ARE NOT INFORMED THAT IT AFFECTS THE BANKERS JOB BECAUSE GALLOP POLL DOES THE SURVEYS. If the customer is having trouble logging in and speaks to 4 different people before getting you who actually helps them log in to the website, and later is surveyed about THE BANK NOT THE BANKER and gives 4 out 5 stars in even ONE of the categories. It is an automatic FAIL. Too many of these  FAILED surveys and banker is written up and eventually terminated. Boiler room tactics are used by the banker coaches to hit the numbers, cheating is rampant among more tenured bankers. I found a another job before it came to that. Felt like was I living in a hybrid medieval cast system/sales sweatshop. Left for a friendlier more honest company.

The way the company pushes to meet goals for 1)sales (yes you have to tell a customer about a product and get them to STAY ON THE PHONE while transferring them to the sales department because YOU cannot help them apply for or open the product you just explained), 2) referral rate in which you get a customer to agree to open an account or apply for loan ect at least 30 times a day but it doesnt count if that cuatomer promised they would with a previous rep on a previous call 3)average handle time (aht or cti for you call center savvy folks) the goal is ridiculously low considering the amount of things necessary to just do basic service on a call. There was scripting to read for pretty much  EVERYTHING (they made sure legally they weren't liable for anything) in addition to the aforementioned need to sell products and transfer them (sitting on hold for a department counts as time spent on the call).   So now you wonder what's so bad about that, well the micro management is intense. First your team lead approaches you to tell you that you're not meeting (you're over on aht by 3 seconds and its your fifth call and you've not had one sale or referral) then a few moments later your manager comes by to remind you that you of the same thing. Then comes a visit from the team lead for the team next to you to relay yet again the same information. Now each time a person pays you a visit they come into your cubicle and tell you about it. Some will put their hands on your chair or shoulders or a favorite is the \"motivational clapping\" all done while you are on a call with a customer who then asks \"whats going on? Is this really wells fargo? Is this some scam?\" And then the damage control which makes for a longer call and yet another string of visits from anyone in leadership who has their walkie talkies on (oh yeah and managemeny had walkie talkies so they can communicate as to who needs to be visited).  With all that going on for 8 to 10 hours a day (depending on schedule) it starts to get to some people, and thats where those nifty benefits of accomodations and short-term disability come in handy for when you need to be treated for anxiety, high blood pressure, insomnia related to stress and a personal favorite PTSD (yes.

About 40 were white and 20 were minorities; the majority black. Surprisingly, about 35 veterans or 95% got offers for summer internships and they were all white.

The moral of the story is, if you are invited to the event and you are white then you have about a 95% chance of getting an offer. However, if you are a minority then you have about a 5%.

Good, hard working employees are being run so hard until they are wasted. It is very harsh, and the daily sales pressure leaves those on the platform side (bankers) going home feeling terrible about themselves no matter how they performed that day. If a banker performs well one day, it is over and the next day begins with being harassed on how prepared they are, why they are not prepared, and how they are going to fix it. Bankers' daily expectations are cold/warm phone calls, \"stagecoaching\" with tellers, making 4 appointments for each day of the week, scheduling 2 outside sales events for local businesses each week, and maintaining expected percentages of customer interactions, products sold, follow up appointments set, printing receipts, and conducting needs assessments. The team as a whole is grilled on why these goals haven't been met. Customers are emailed surveys on how they felt they were served and the scoring is either 100% or bust. Everyday the team has a morning huddle and the managers are forced to ask each employee what they are going to do to change their performance. \r\n\r\nAnd the goals are only increasing. Bankers and tellers alike are being told if they don't perform adequately they will be formally reprimanded and then terminated. Everyday there is at least one (but usually 2-3) conference calls with the district manager, who drives the same emotionally abusive statements into banker's heads. She has literally told team members that performance is unacceptable and that they are terrible and it's no wonder why the surveys come in failing (remember they are 100% or fail: a 4 out of 5 is considered fail), it's no wonder why team members don't achieve bonus commission and they will never succeed with the company.

However, ultimately it is difficult to effect change through poor management that lacks leadership skills.\r\n\r\n2)  A small number of truly excellent bankers, mentors, and just good, decent people.", "cons": "1)  Toxic Work Environment:  Unfortunately a culture has been allowed to develop and thrive at the Wells Fargo San Diego Regional Commercial Banking Office (RCBO) that allows and encourages gossip and rumours to advance one's interest; that puts others down; and that diminishes hard work and destroys any sort of initiative and pride in your work.  It is a toxic environment that management not only tolerates, but engenders.  Management lacks the leadership skills, self-confidence, and self-respect to lead a successful team.  Management frequently lies, resorts to manipulative behavior, or just plain uses their position to hurt others when they are having a bad day.  Management is unequipped to lead a team.  Unfortunately, there has been a lack of leadership by management for years at this office and the office now finds itself with morale at an all-time low.\r\n\r\n2)  High Turn-over Rate:  Directly related to the above, few bankers and analysts remain for more than a year.  This is particularly true for any sort of talent that the bank is able to attract.  Talent is able to quickly find better offers once they realize how toxic this office is.  This unfortunately leaves lower performers unable to find new roles.  These low performers often remain and resort to the tactics above to make up for a shortage of talent.  This further contributes to low morale.\r\n\r\n3)  Low Pay:  30-50% lower base salary and compensation than peers from Business School in other industries\r\n\r\n4)  Lack of Opportunities to Develop and Grow:  There is a dearth of development and growth opportunities and even opposition by management to efforts to add new skills.  Initiative outside of work is even punished.  Several colleagues and I took the CFA.  Instead of being recognized and rewarded for taking this initiative, many of us were reprimanded by management and told to discontinue our study because management could not see the value.\r\n\r\n5)  Bottom Talent:  The analysts and bankers that have survived to this point at Wells Fargo are often the bottom of the barrel.  They do not have a strong grasp of accounting and finance principles.  Even simple grammar is a challenge for some \u2013 one analyst could not even write a one page report that was intelligible.  One senior credit officer did not know how to apply a filter to financial data - and certainly could not build any sophisticated financial models or pivot tables.  There is zero statistical analysis that is done.  It is unnerving to see how few written and verbal skills Wells Fargo commercial bankers and analysts possess.\r\n\r\n6)  Few Transferrable Skills:  This is much more of a sales role than was presented by recruiters.  Few transferrable skills are required for the role.  This makes it difficult to transfer to a role outside of commercial banking, except the most basic of sales roles.  Within finance, it is much more difficult.  It is virtually impossible go from commercial banking to investment banking, research, or any other finance role.\r\n\r\n7)  Not Enjoyable; Not Rewarding:  For many of the reasons already listed above, this is just not an enjoyable role.  There is no energy at the San Diego RCBO.  No enthusiasm.  No passion for your job.  There is no dynamic interaction between peers or exciting projects.  On top of all this, you must deal with the erratic, hostile, unsupportive, and often toxic behaviour of management.  The San Diego RCBO is simply a miserable place to be.  Either choose a better RCBO, or better yet, skip commercial banking altogether.  There is just no upside to the role."}, {"review_title": "Good Company to advance career", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "10 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are a variety of different divisions within Wells Fargo where one can advance in their financial career.

I also saw the deterioration of a top notch sales department with banking professionals to account peddling expendable employees. Not because they intended to but they were trained to think short term gains.\r\n\r\nOn the outside looking in: we went from business dress attire to a t shirt and tennis shoes attire. Career minded individuals to not so career minded. A wave of \"millennials\" replaced many folks who had been there for many years. \r\n\r\nThe company celebrated the young workers. However, did not plan for them long term. The revolving door, the high turn over in all the retail banking departments and all the customer's after the promise that WF would help them achieve their financial goals brewed misconduct.\r\n\r\nIn writing all looked fancy as well as the resources in the company website, elegant like the logo. However the leaders kept us busy with calls (unable to use the resources) and kept us from networking events with other departments not to mention the fear instilled in us in reaching out to HR or the department manager about any issue. Some employees would print screen the manager gallup survey high scores they were giving them every year to stay on the manager/supervisor good side. The belief was the nail that sticks out gets hammered. \r\n\r\nIt retrospect, a lot of effort and strategy went into keeping us from finding out what was really going on from those that knew the truth. To my old colleagues remember how I pointed out what was going on during our 15 min huddles (once they were training sessions 1 hr long a week but reduced and eliminated b/c of \"all hands on deck \" urgency). \r\n\r\nWe used to receive great sales leads and referrals. Then we were forced to stay logged on to the phone with account review referrals, miss coaching session/training, to having a tel line with a 16 digit extension for customer's to call us (really), how about the not allowed to perform sale call backs and the random calls b/c mortgage, auto finance and customer service wait times were over 20 minutes. The managers at the call center the longest had many tricks up their sleeves. There was nothing random about management. \r\n\r\nThere were also repetitive calls of customer service issues that were unresolved that were transferred to sales because phone bank CS and mortgage departments were short staffed and inundated by calls for issues that were unresolved due to inexperienced staff. \r\n\r\nThe idea was send the call to sales, refer the customer to the branch they will make it happen. >$.$< Now the truth comes out. Yikes!! They sure over did it.\r\n\r\nThere were also many customer complaints of unethical behavior by employees which we had to overcome, gain their trust to make sales just to find out at the end of the quarter we would not get credit b/c upper management changed the metrics once again. Those of us that followed the ruled kissed our bonus good bye while the execs cashed in.\r\n\r\nIn sales we lost how to submit feedback for what was happening. Management looked the other away forced to follow the strategy plan from the top. That's why Stumpf thanked the managers in an interview earlier this year. When I was there the employees were celebrated right after the Wachovia integration. Then two years later he says thanks to managers because they made execs millions.\r\n\r\nIt is evident management and execs will find any reason to let an employee go. From tardies, to scoring only your bad calls out of thousands (no coincidence), pointing out only the negatives. They would not have been in business so long if it was not for us who followed the rules. \r\n\r\nOne more thing, HR and Liberty Mutual worked together to deny or cut short employees disability leave. HR coached managers on how to \"deal\" with employees. \r\n\r\nI'm not the only one that got fed up and left."}, {"review_title": "Very serious job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They have great benefits, everybody is so friendly and helpful with the new people.

You are expected to take inbound calls all day (\u201cnew leads\u201d from the collections department) and discuss options to avoid foreclosure. If a customer wants to apply, you do an hour long interview, and tell them what income documents you need to submit them to underwriting, then the clock starts and you are expected to get them back within 30 days and they track this statistic. After you have all documents, you send them to underwriting, once a decision is reached you relay it to customer, and work with them until program is complete. Many calls are monitored and graded and they have VERY VERY STRICT guidelines on what they want you to say and scripts to read. So you take inbound calls and also have your own pipeline of 150-300 customers to juggle. The customers are typically going through a very difficult financial hardship and being empathetic to everything is expected.  You are expected to do the jobs of other departments but aren\u2019t paid for it. People messed up REAL CUSTOMERS accounts and then you would always have to fix it, which the mistake should not happen in the first place. This job was an absolutely awful experience.

Everyone on the platform (sales) side had at least 3 different reports to fill out manually for every sales transaction you did.  We spent so much time on useless reports, tracker sheets and multiple conference calls, there was very little time to be proactive and call customers or prospects.  For example, on Thursday and Friday, which are typically busy days, we had 5 (yes 5) conference calls per day...not to mention we still had the daily reports and tracker sheets to fill out and send in.  As far as banks are concerned, it is a complete joke.  There is no real banking going on, just chasing your tail all day long.  The only thing Wells wants you to do is to cram unwanted products down your customers' throats.  We saw a lot of good clients leave the bank due to Wells Fargo way of doing business.  The rates on loans and deposits are the worst in town by far.  We would brace ourself when giving our rates to customers because we would always and I mean always have the worst rates.  I worked for Wachovia for over 5 years and 1 year for Wells Fargo and the difference in the culture of the companies is huge.  Wachovia had some focus on the customer and the employee, but Wells Fargo is the Wal-Mart of banks, they do not care about their clients or employees.  They chase after low end customers, tie them down with a lot of products that make it difficult to change banks and then treat them like dirt.  The only difference between Wal-mart and Wells is the blue vests the employees wear.  After the we started taking on some of the Wells Fargo banking model we had a lot of high end clients leave the bank in droves.  After quiting Wells and working for another bank, it is refreshing to actually have lending authority, management that allows you to do your job and a fair paycheck.

It didn't help that management was absolutely appalling. \r\n\r\nIt was a small in-store location, but we had absolutely ridiculous sales goals, and they were completely unrealistic, and then because we hadn't made sales goals in months, we had to try and make up for that as well. I was there for 9 months, and when I started we, as a store, hadn't made a goal in two months, plus we were understaffed, and a majority of the staff was new. When I left, I was one of 3 members of the staff that had been there the longest, and I saw one of the highest turnover rates I've ever seen. \r\n\r\nMy manager was probably the main reason for everything. I know she got a lot of pressure from above, because we were doing so poorly, but her solution was to sit at a computer, until matters came to a head, then try something, sometimes fix things, then yell at you for hours until you broke and cried, even though you didn't entirely know that you had even done something wrong. She never tried to re-train you, or help you understand what you could do next time. And this process was true of everyone on staff. Every woman there cried at least once a week at work. The one guy who managed to stay on staff, was written up multiple times because he wouldn't show up for hours at a time on a regular basis. However, he was never fired for this, because my manager liked him, but the rest of us were just as bad or worse in my manager's mind, because we weren't making our ridiculous goals, no matter how much we tried, and were written up just as much for that. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. I was a customer of WF since 1999. I closed all my accounts promptly when I left. \r\n\r\nI was also asked multiple times to do some very shady things when customers applied for various credit products, including \"rounding\" up salary and length of employment to make sure people were approved, no matter my personal feelings on it. Often, I had to clean up my managers mistakes when she opened accounts before I had even started, and customers were charged fees for months that they didn't know about, because she had never explained to them what she was doing with their money.

They will just send out email reminders to keep asking to get something done, but you don't have to do your job to stay.", "cons": "-Management is awful, aside from regulations that are understandable, managers change what is required to pass criteria on a daily basis. Something may be good enough one day, but not the next. \r\n- You really cannot do anything to go above and beyond and prove yourself, because it doesn't matter to managers. For example: each team member (roughly 12 team members) should have 60 files (projects) each, so if you have 90 projects, it is almost impossible to keep up with the amount of documents, phone calls, emails, checks to pay, etc. all of the work you will need to complete in an 8 hour day. IN ADDITION to that, there are team member who are capped at 40 files, meaning you must take on the files they cannot handle. So in turn, while you are working as hard as possible to maintain your own projects without falling (too far behind,because it is impossible to keep up) behind, you must also work on those projects of other employees who cannot handle their additional work. Essentially making it impossible to complete your day to day operations, even for the best employees in the office. \r\n\r\nThey continually make people feel like dirt for screwing up some of the most TRIVIAL things. For example (just one example of MANY), in our department we need to send checks out through a different team to pay people. If there is a box that was not \"checked\", they will send an email to you, your team manager, your team lead, the head manager, the other teams manager, and many times a few more people. Just to say that you screwed it up. When in reality, the person cutting the check, could have just checked the box and not sent the email. Or sent a personal email to the person saying to check the box. The moral of that story is they do not care about you personally and they will not hesitate to throw EVERYONE under the bus for sometimes what is their errors to begin with. \r\n\r\nLastly, the majority of people who are making the most in the office, have less work to do and do not even do that portion of their work. In turn making the lower persons cover that work as well. \r\n\r\nDealing with the muddy clarification from management on how to perform your work and the clear blindness to letting other employees, literally just not do their job and be praised for not doing their job puts a major disadvantage on any moral in the office. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend ever going to Wells Fargo unless you would like to be treated like a 5 year old and then get your wrist slapped over the most trivial of things while the bigger picture are clearly being over looked.

They even give out your personal information to customers which should be illegal. People with children are given preferential treatment over people who are not. The higher up your position, the less you do in a day. Sitting on your butt at a computer eating is not helping your tellers. Get off your butt and help. Showing up to work, on time, and not being on your phone all day should be obvious qualities. Nope, even the managers spend all day on social media and checking their phones. Part-time people do everything without all the perks and benefits of full-time and the entitled full-time people treat you like dirt on the bottom of their shoes. You can raise your hand if you want everyday to be a living hell and for money to go missing from your drawer. I cannot tell you how many part-time employees were fired because their drawers constantly had money go missing if they did not stay late, did not work full-time, called out any unfairness, etc. Anyone who spoke out was eliminated. If that is not the definition of retaliation then I do not know what was. I have talked to all those people and it is the same broken record story: they hired me as part-time, worked me as full-time, would not allow me to have a second job, did not give me the perks of full-time work, full-time people are always on PTO and I have to work full time to cover their constant absences, and then money started missing from my drawer. I know they are closing something like 3,000-4,000 branches and all those people will be without work because of lawsuits. I also know they are being investigated by the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice for all the crap they have pulled. If you think a company who defrauds customers and lies to its employees will not lie to and steal from you, you are being blatantly stupid. They are all about greed and putting money in their pocket even if it means taking from customers and employees. Morals, ethics, and professionalism do not exist and when you call them out and report them, they will make your life a living hell. Your coworkers will know, gang up on you, harass you, sabotage you, and make you wish you were dead rather than go to work everyday. You will get ahead if you put on a show when Stephen and Nathan are there no matter how unethical, lazy, or hateful you are when they are not there. They are intelligent men and they will figure it out one day. You will be threatened by people you report and they will destroy your career as well as any future in banking.

These HMC's are not required to obtain any outside referrals, or complete the required 10 weekly sales activities, and are given accolades for their production.    Also, some HMC's have several banks that they cover that produce many mortgage leads, and others have 1 or 2 slow locations producing no leads.  \r\n\r\nIn my office, there are 11 loan officers, and the top 3 producers are on this fast response lead pool and have 3 or more busy bank branches that they cover.

Basically QA tries to find any thing they can to ding you on. This isn\u2019t simply under performance.\r\n\r\nSecond, the opportunity for advancement within the company. Most of the managers that don\u2019t have to take calls sit in their positions forever...and why not? Once you\u2019re off the phones you can sit on your cell phone all day, talk about random crap, and put their foot on the necks of those still taking calls for sport because they\u2019re somehow \u201cbetter\u201d than us.\r\n\r\nThird, is the fact that the company doesn\u2019t care about you at all. This may be different in other LOB but in the call centers you\u2019re pretty much expendable.  You\u2019re a number and that\u2019s about it.  They couldn\u2019t care less if you\u2019re sick, hurting, or having a family emergency. Plus, office politics is very prevalent in the call centers. Don\u2019t expect any movement or recognition unless you\u2019re the work directors/supervisors \u201cpet\u201d or are friends.\r\n\r\nForth, the \u201cethics\u201d of the company. I don\u2019t go a day where a customer doesn\u2019t bring up the shady stuff WF has been in the news for which makes your job even more difficult than it already is, I agree with the customers though. WF isn\u2019t nearly as customer friendly as Chase or Capital One.\r\n\r\nLastly, the stress. The company wants you to live up to impossible standards and doesn\u2019t appreciate good employees. You could be doing amazing but they still find 2-3 things you need to work on and like I mentioned above they take away your bonuses for trumped up errors that make no sense  .

They care more about you having quick calls than actually solving the customers' problems. They tell you in training don't worry about AHT because the customer experience is more important. But once you get out of training, if your AHT is high, which is normal, you will constantly get nagged over it and micromanaged. AHT is probably the most important metric to them because they say the company spends millions of dollars in operation costs every second you're on the phone. But if you don't completely solve the customer's probably they'll have to call back and take up more time. I've had managers give us tips for how to get customers off the phone before they bring up another thing they need help with so that you can meet the AHT metric. Bad business practice.\r\n-They sell you on the bonus you could get based on customer experience surveys. But even if you do really well in that, you won't get it even if your AHT is a couple seconds too high or if you had a QA dock and you're even a point off the requirement. But the rest of your team will still get a bonus based on the team's customer survey scores including your scores in the average.\r\n-Even if you get a high score in your schedule adherence, your ability to solve the customer's problem on the first call, high customer scores, high quality assurance scores, etc, if your AHT isn't perfect even if you've brought it down, you won't get any reward and very little recognition.\r\n-You get some good customers but you'll get a lot who scream at you, cuss at you, personally insult you and your intelligence, etc. and the company does little to prevent these types of customers from calling in and treating team members that way.\r\n-There's very little flexibility to actually help customers and I agree some policies aren't fair to them. Those are tough calls to take and you get them a lot.\r\n-No time to breath with maximum nine seconds between calls. Back to back for 8-10 hours. If you get up to use the bathroom outside of breaks it affects your schedule adherence. Every second of your time is micromanaged and you start to feel like a child and it's hard to regroup after a call.\r\n-Too many coachings. At least once a week, but can be multiple times a week. They  will also plug in and listen to your calls while you take them to coach you, which is very stressful and inefficient. The occasional coaching and performance review is good. But too often starts to feel overwhelming and like a punishment. I don't know any adults at their job who are coached that often.\r\n-Sometimes you will get a cool manager. Sometimes you will get one who micromanages worse than most and tracks you down to remind you to go to a meeting instead of trusting you to be an adult and check your own schedule. They will make you fill out unnecessary forms about your calls as you go through them. The will move you around on teams so if you get a good manager, don't get too comfortable.\r\n-If you go to a manager needing help for something with benefits, leaves, your schedule, etc, they will either give you incorrect info because they don't know much. Or they won't help you at all and claim there's nothing they can do for you when they can.\r\n-We once had a meeting with our manager's boss to give anonymous feedback. Beforehand said manager complained about anonymous feedback he was given previously. After the meeting, he talked to each employee individually and reworded the comments as questions to figure out who said what.\r\n-If you have advice for how something can be done better or how they can help you to do your job better, they won't listen to it because they \"have to\" do things the way they are\r\n-This job will ruin your mental health and make you anxious and drained all the time. You learn that rude customers aren't making it personal, but hours of that a day still drains you and makes it hard to focus.

Too many times where you have to deal with customers saying \"I was told to open this and now I'm getting fees\" while you suck it up put on a lovely face and pretty much tell the customer sorry but your fees pays for our salary and company profit for CEOs to throw more money at charities.  Unfortunately CEO gets all the glory, being the most charitable man and company.  But the ones that makes this possible are tellers who go against work ethics to force charge fees on customers and low income customers paying fees.  Sales pressure will make you say \"Oh you already applied for our credit card and got declined last month? no problem try again today because I'm forced to offer you a credit card anyways not only would it ruin your credit even more but at least I get my manager off my back for one customer\"\r\n-Sale Pressure consistently, even if you're a top gold performer at your district.  You'll have a manager who does absolutely nothing and stay silent  breathing down your neck. After every transaction they'll ask you \"how come you didn't ask about this or that\".  Never happen to me before but a lot of tellers at my branch gets fired or made them cried and quit because of this.  After Rookie quarter you're expected to meet threshold goal which may sound easy but that is getting sales points everyday to either open accounts or get credits card or loans.  If you usually have the same customer coming in you'll run out of things to sell other than more checking and savings account which they don't ever need.  This is the part that'll eat you up inside, telling customers to open things they don't need and knowing that they'll get fees in the future to save your job?  Trying sleeping through the night doing that. If you don't meet the threshold you'll be written up as a warning, second quarter where you don't meet the threshold again final warning, then 3rd quarter termination!\r\n-Knowing that Wells Fargo \"selects\" their customers, the \"ant colony\" like business would reward rich and punish the poor customers.  Forcing low income customers who lives pay check to pay check to purchase consistently to avoid fees when all they want to do is save money.  When they do pay monthly service fees they don't even get any useful benefits at all, paying $10 dollars a month and they don't even get free cashier's checks.  If you're fine working for a company who earns profits through customers fees then so be it.\r\n-Extremely low wage, and annual wage raise is less than a quarter even if you're a top gold performer in the district every quarter.  Not to mention since they forces you to wear suits and ties everyday, you'll be paying a lot on dry cleaning.  \r\n-Sum and all they make you feel like you don't matter, they'll just replace you that's why Wells Fargo have the highest turnover rate.\r\n-Service Survey,  this is a heart breaker.  Each day for the duration of your employment you're constantly nervous when these survey comes through.  What these are are every time a customer  gets helped, they may get a service survey.  the survey is a 1-5 rating and its 5 or nothing.  The survey will ask 5 core question but one of that question is \"Did the teller ask any financial related question\" , if any of the 5 core question was a 4 or under they will be asked 20 more questions which gives the manager a chance to choke your neck at morning meetings.  And the morning meets are dreadful, its always the same.  We got a bad survey and they customer rated us a 4 for not using name, now what we're going to do for the next hour is \"Skills practice\" (Fake transaction between team members)  to make sure we are trained to know how to use names.  \r\n-Now that reminded me, I absolutely hate hate hate skills practice.  what it is, is teams members will get together playing roles either as a teller or customers and we do fake transactions.  we would do this every morning for 30 mins and every Thursday for 2 hours. and every downtime when there are no customers.  My service is genuine so skills practice and role play only trains me to become robots.

If you can get 'in' with the manager, you can do whatever you want.  Otherwise, the managers will be very strict about policies.

Its just like the cool kids in high school again.  If you are one of them, everything is perfect, if you are on the outside, you get treated differently.  This manifested when an employee of several years refused to give credit to a new employee \"because she was new\" but the other tellers can have the credit \"because they have been here longer and talk to customers more.\"\r\n- Males get better treatment.  In the most recent batch of new tellers, the male teller was given the key to his station, to begin working independently a full week ahead of the female.  Also, the female teller did not get the same instructions on how to gain credit for sales, so that female lost out on a whole months worth of sales credits.  The manager primarily responsible for this training was also  female.  A third example: the same male employee was told before a holiday that he had to clock hours for that holiday to get credit.  The same female employee did not get this information until after the holiday when she noticed that her pay was lower than it should have been.  It took her two pay periods before she was able to get that money.  \r\n- Less than competent service management.

For me, my Region was part of a geographic realignment four years ago that resulted in a change of management for me.  I had reported to the same Sr. Leader for 15 years and supported my Region through the merger with Wells Fargo on her team.  Overnight I was out of her Super Region an in a new Regoin, this has become the rule at Wells Fargo rather than the exception in the last 5 years.  The problem is what my former manager recognized as my strengths, my new manager found to be gaping weaknesses despite my successful performance.  Long story short, I have been micro-managed and picked to pieces by this manager until he finally felt justified to terminate me in January 2015, not re-hirable by the way.  No severance no nothing. I disputed that and after 90 days was offeted full re-reinstatement, reprting right back to the same manager.  I had no alternatives with \"not re-hirable\" ony employment history, so I went back.  It has bern difficult, no one has made it easy, not my team, not my partners and certainly not my manager.  I have had a handful.of supporters I have been very appreciative of.
