The \"strong sales culture\" of Wells Fargo dominates every moment of working in a retail store.  Most people do not realize how pervasive and important sales are in banking, unless they have worked in one.  I did for 9 years, beginning as a Personal Banker (I jokingly referred to myself as a \"Personal Slave\") and working my way up to an upper level Store Manager with 25 team members and many thousands of transactions per month.  I got those promotions primarily because of sales results.  I'm certainly under no illusions about that.  Fortunately, those sales were ethical and moral.  I never trained or encouraged any TM to sell just for the sake of selling or to lie to customers.  I feel a bank's most important asset, after their people, is their reputation.  And I don't mean a AAA rating.  I mean what the average customer would say about you.  Ethics should be #1 as anything pertaining to money is reliant on confidence, including the value of our currency.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as I progressed, I found that the sales goals became increasingly difficult to reach.  I saw other stores exceeding goal by 150% or more and initially, wanted to learn from those stores so I and my TM's could make bonus and receive recognition.  Perhaps they knew something I didn't or were better at communicating with customers.  What I found was that they had thrown all ethics out the door.  I was shocked and appalled, especially with all the lip service WF gives about their high ethics and their dedication to helping customers succeed financially.  So, naturally, I alerted my manager.  I reported blatant cheating to the ethics line WF provides to team members.  I alerted HR.  Nothing happened to the offenders except promotions!  I saw this time and time again.  While I was being forced to fired amazing TM's just for missing goal, these heartless, cruel and selfish beings were being promoted!  ..and still are to this day!  My friends who still work there told me that they have been told not to call the ethics line about cheating sales anymore \"due to a high volume of these kinds of calls\".  They are supposed to contact that person's manager.  A lot of good that does since managers make huge bonuses based on what their employees produce...obviously, there's no incentive to fire unethical people when it hurts you in your pocket book.  So the cheating of customers continues and is tacitly supported by upper management.\r\n\r\nThe things that makes me most angry is the disregard to human beings:  both customers and front line team members.  It all boils down to numbers and profit.  While I realize companies are in business to make money, the amount of profit this institution generates is mind boggling.  The biggest \"fee income\" generator for the state of Arizona is on Direct Deposit Advance...just another name for payday loans.  Usury.  Team members know what it does to customers and their lives and have been vocal about getting rid of it.  They know it's wrong, but since it's such a money maker, the bank continues offering that \"service\".  \r\n\r\nFor TM's, it's like this...sell sell sell.  Nothing else matters...customer service, being kind to other employees, working hard, trying to give proper advice to customers, intelligent recommendations...NONE of it matters except your numbers.  YOU don't even matter...except for your numbers.

This means that bankers are doing whatever is necessary for THEM to get those numbers on to the system, even if it means blatantly lying to customers in order to get the \"solutions\". The customer's interest is NOT the banker's priority because doing what's right for the customer usually means not \"getting anything\" out of them. Wells Fargo's system gives it's bankers the option to convert accounts without having to change the customer's account number, but instead of using this option, bankers always close accounts and reopen new ones in order to receive credit and make their numbers. This means that the customer has to take the time to change their direct deposits and any automatic debits or credits that they have coming into their accounts. This is NOT in the customer's best interest, but it happens EVERYDAY at EVERY BRANCH and management turns a blind eye. This is just one example of how CORRUPT this company is. Officially, managers tell the staff to go by the book. Unofficially, bankers are expected to do ANYTHING it takes to make their own numbers and help the branch meet it's goal. Anything means lie, cheat, take customers from other bankers, run to customers hoping to get something out of them, team up on customers in order to talk them in to opening new accounts. ANYTHING! Wells Fargo retail is horrible! I'll sum it up with this: When I gave my manager notice that I had found a better job and would be leaving, he asked me if I could try to get him a job also!!

Management and HR make statements like,\" We do not want to get in an arms race with other departments for Risk Management talent so everyone needs to keep the salary offers limited\". What they do not realize is that they are in an arms race with their competitors and a lot of talent has been leaving in the Risk Management areas because W.F does not pay enough to keep true talent. W.F is an old company. In the last year I have been witness to 5 retirements and the positions are not replaced in those areas. The remaining managers have 25 to 30 years at W.F, previous Norwest and are just biding time for retirement to collect their pensions.

This stems from the unrealistic goals that Wells Fargo has for its bankers. In a short amount of time (4 minutes and 30 seconds or less), you must service the call, follow all procedures to stay in compliance (failing to do so can result in termination and other possible consequences), refer to the customer, and hopefully get them over to sales. The biggest struggles for most are AHT and the Referral Rate. It is possible to get the customers off the line in a short amount of time, but other metrics such as QA and KDM suffer because \"you didn't take enough time with the customer.\" Sales is #1 in this call center environment, which is fine, but allow more time to spend with the customer. We have to go so fast through servicing the call that we don't get ample time to really know how the customer could benefit from another product or service, especially those that have almost all of them. It takes time and referrals would be of a higher quality if they weren't pushed so much OR if we could have a higher AHT. Those two metrics have been a struggle since the start, and instead of acknowledging that, the attitude is simply \"you better fix it.\" This makes for a sometimes hostile work environment, depending on your current leadership. Not every minute of everyday is going to be top of the charts in terms of metrics.

I had a woman come in who was in a hurry, she was rude and kept saying \"what's the hold up??\" Well, I remembered what they'd told me in training and I stopped panicking, and politely told her I was looking into the issue.. I called the Banker help line & was totally cool calm and collected. I said I was having an issue with her card (even though I wasn't), and the Banker on the phone soon caught on. She walked me through the process, I completed the womans transaction, and the woman never once knew that I had no clue as to what I was doing. \r\nAlso- WF will help you with your tuition. I got my masters while working there.. I worked 40 hours/wk, and had school 2 nights/week. They were very accommodating and allowed me to leave 10-15 minutes early so I wouldn't be late.", "cons": "I was a Personal Banker & fortunate to work with an amazing team at a large WF Branch. However, every Monday, we had a \"Conference call,\" to discuss our daily/weekly/monthly sales goals. Unfortunately, near the end of my tenure at WF, corporate shifted dramatically & we were basically told to push the tellers for sales- meaning, they'd help someone who was there to deposit/withdrawal $ and want to be in and out if the ATM line was too long.. Well, the teller would have to use an insanely long scripted sales pitch and send them to a Banker. The customers-especially the \"old school\" people who'd been banking there for years would get extremely aggravated and upset. I worked in a small town where everybody knew everyone so that became an issue. In fact, it got to the point where they'd just come in, walk over to my desk- whether I was with a customer or not and just hover. I'd politely ask them to wait if I was with a customer, but if I wasn't, they'd just sit down (never mind the fact that I was clearly busy or on the telephone with a customer) & literally say, \"can you please make a deposit/withdrawal, etc., I don't want to go to a teller because they always try to sell me something and end up sending me over to a banker anyway..\" It put all of the Bankers in a bad situation & the entire dynamic of the Bank changed. Now that I'm not an employee, I can see that it's gotten worse.. I walk in to my local branch & they now have people standing around asking you what you're there for. If you say, \"I need to make a withdrawal,\" (or whatever it is you're there to do), they keep probing you and probing you.. i e., \"Do you have a savings account with us as well? (If you say yes), it's \"Is it linked to your OD protection? If you say no, it's I can help you. Come with me.\" They then proceed to take you to a Banker and say, \"So and so here is interested in a Savings account...\" What the heck?! I've seen people take it with a grain of salt, but 9 times out of 10, the customer becomes extremely irritated, annoyed and a select few become irate! Because I was an employee, I was able to have the amount of $ I take out of the ATM on a daily basis increased.. But here's a secret-- YOU can TOO!! You just have to ask! If you're a good customer- no or very few overdrafts, have been a customer for over 5+ years and have an established relationship with your personal Banker, they'll raise it for you. I'm not saying everyone will, as it Is the Bankers discretion, but yes, you can get more than $300, $500 out a day. \r\nAlso, for all the pushing they do to sell, the commission is HORRIBLE! They pay out quarterly (every 3 months). I kept a little notebook with all of my sales (they track them\r\nVia the computer too). However, there are tons of errors. You're LUCKY if you make $800-$1000 in commission every 3 months.. But that's very rare. The average pay for a Personal Banker (DOE) is about $24,000-$30,000. So, if you think you'll make an extra $20k in commission, this is not the job for you. Be prepared to work Saturdays- they're open until 4:00pm (used to be 1:00pm), and if you work in an \"in-store\" Branch- i.e., inside of a Supermarket, be prepared to work later hours and Sunday's too."}, {"review_title": "Management", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Business Owner", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some good benefits.

Pretty much all the internships can lead to full time job offers by the end...even if you're only in your junior year, a lot of employers will offer for you to come back the next summer if you express interest....which is a good thing to have in this economy. \r\nAll WF internships are paid as well, which is nice. Depending on the internship, pay probably ranges between 12 and 27 dollars per hour...again, depending on which program you're in. There are also informal internships sometimes...it depends on the office, but I imagine compensation is similar. \r\n\r\nThe interview process is fairly standard. I submitted an application online and then within a few days was contacted by HR to schedule a phone interview. I interviewed for positions in different locations across the US, so different interviewers contacted me at different points in time. After the phone interviews, I was scheduled to come in for a Super Day at an office where I would be working. I was interviewed by a panel of 3 people and pretty much told on the spot that they'd be extending an offer. At that point, I was contacted for an additional interview with the director at the specific office where I would be working, but that was mostly just an informal chat so he'd get a sense of who I was. The questions were mostly behavioral...a few were technical. They usually have a conference call before hand that you can listen in on to get a sense of what kinds of questions they're going to ask you on your interview. \r\n\r\nAt the actual job, my co-workers were super nice! There were plenty of awesome training programs and events to attend. We also got to do really interesting work, and by the time I left I had made several strategic connections and had full time job offers.", "cons": "None that I can think of. There may be weird politics in some of the offices, but that's standard of any place and I never really noticed that it was a problem. Also, since WF is often decentralized, there isn't really a housed analyst class anywhere so a lot of co-workers will be old. However, there are programs and events to help you meet the other analyst-level young people, so you'll make connections...just don't expect a college-like environment like you might get at some other places."}, {"review_title": "Great, part-time job with good benefits.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Dec 2011", "job_title": "Teller", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They give tons of praise and recognition, 401k gets matched, help pay for school, as a part-time worker they give you the option of full medical benefits, teaches you teamwork  and how to reach goals as a team.", "cons": "In order to move up to corporate, you have to move up through the store level, and have a masters.

Employees are observed several times throughout the day on the way they interact with customers. Every time we get done with our interactions the managers will go over with you what you did well and what you didn't do well. They do this because we get surveyed on random customers. This is done on a scale from 1-5, if we even get a 4, it's considered to be a \"bad shop.\" This is probably the most annoying thing that wells fargo does with it's employees because it doen't matter if you've had 20 perfect shops they will continue to micro manage you with observations. They need to back off with this, if your employee is doing well with shops then you shouldn't have to do observations on him/her. \r\n\r\n- Managers place too much of an emphasis on sales aka solutions, they ask me everyday if I know friends or family who will open wells fargo accounts. The last thing I'm going to do is ask friends and family to open wells fargo accounts on my off days. \r\n\r\n- Solution system is messed up. Every solution is referred to a banker in which they have to contact the customer to finalize the sale. If all of that is successful you might get credit for the sale depending on if that same customer has already been referred by a different teller. This system is flawed because you're also suppose to send \"service signals\" as a referral to your manager whenever you have a disgruntled customer. This works against you because you could close someone on signing up for another account but if someone had already sent a referral for a service issue on him/her then they would still credit for that sale. It's ridiculous that people can get sales for unrelated matters, you should be able to credit for a sale that you closed. \r\n\r\n- Hitting bonuses are unrealistic as well, from what i've been told the goals in order to hit bonuses are the same for every store. This doesn't make sense because you could be at a branch thats 10 times slower than most branches in our market but you're still expected to hit the same bonus goal. Also, hitting a bonus is a requirement not a \"bonus\" if you do not hit your 1st tier bonus you will be written up. It's ironic how getting a bonus is considered expected, I thought it was a bonus because you went beyond your usual call and made extra sales. \r\n\r\n- Don't cap solution sales. A teller can only get a maximum of 3 solutions per customer regardless of what ever else the personal banker is able to get out of them. I can see why they did this from a business perspective but it definitely works against you as a teller. \r\n\r\n- Extreme punctuality guidelines. I know its expected at any employer to be on time, what gets to me is the fact that managers will still write you up for being a couple minutes late if it happens. \r\n\r\n- Incentives are horrible. Once again from a business perspective I understand that the company cannot give out $100 incentives but I feel like the company can do a lot better than handing out $5 gift cards or giving out company merchandise. Who wants wells fargo water bottles as an incentive to close sales? On top of that, my manager literally told me that we need to get more solutions in order for our district manager to get her bonus. This kind of thing frustrates me to hear because I can assure you that the DM is getting a much bigger bonus than I ever will see so to hear that as a motivation factor really makes me want to do the opposite and not get solutions. \r\n\r\n- All of these cons are coming from the retail side of Wells Fargo, I cannot obviously speak for any other department in the company."}, {"review_title": "Wells Fargo in general is a good company to work for.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Oct 2012", "job_title": "Personal Banker I in Chesapeake, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "With Wells Fargo, there is such a wide variety of career moves one can make within the company.

It is personal opinion if whether or not it is going to help them, but regardless, you better profile every single person that comes in, even for a thumbprint and try to get them to open accounts.  The ironic thing is, a free checking account from a new client is worth more to the company then, say, a Interest Bearing CD on a daily basis in terms of solutions.  For example, a branch would need 12 checking accounts and 60 solutions, which is basically 2  equally divided amongst 6 bankers.  If you open 5 CD's in one day, but dont open a single checking account, it is frowned upon.  Each branch's atmosphere is different.

Say good bye to saturdays if your branch is low on Bankers because you'll be working every saturday until atleast 215 with no lunch break.  The only good thing about that is, you'll have a day off during the week.  If you get sick and your low on numbers, or another banker is out, you'll be told to \"suck it up\" and come in anyways.  Count on always being sick, expecially flu season, because every other customer that comes in is contanimated.  You're always working, even out of work because you're expected to build leads on your own.

My coworkers were always on the hunt for free food. They espcially liked the food gift packages abandoned in the kitchens around the holidays. They would attend career development meetings and get on email lists just to scope out the offerings at these corporate sponsored events. So there are plenty of free resouces, software, extra paid weeks off, self improvement classes and access to good food if you know the right people at this company.", "cons": "An internal recruiter once told me that they only pay 80% or so of the listed salary for a open position. Why? So they is room for pay increases once you are hired. You must stay in a postion for at least a year before you can transfer. Hiring managers appear to prefer outsiders to insiders. Lots of positions are prefilled before they are posted online, as in they know who they are hiring for a role but the Staff Mgmt system generates a opening when there is none. S.F. is ground zero for lay offs at the moment. They lay off there and then turn around hire in cheaper  and more business friendly states like Ohio and S. Carolina. Apply for open postions in any location, if they like you they will let you commute but your payrate may be for another \"zone\". A coworker once warned us to be careful of what location you work at, telecommuting or working in an isolated office can hurt  your career. As in It's hard to prove yourself if you are not in the main office making connections with decision makers. The best way to move up is to move to Charlotte, make connections, or apply out of state. Ask good questions during meetings if you want to get noticed and build your brand image. Choose your manager well to make sure they will support your career, otherwise you will be in the same postion for 10-20-30 years.

So the training is not interchangeable from branch to branch.\r\n\r\nThere's 4 different managers and oh boy, if they all aren't on the same page it gets really really bad. \r\n\r\nANYTHING the company does that hits the news and its bad, customers will view you as a part of it rather its your branch of not, rather its in your state or not, your a part of it. You get a bad rep. (Currently dealing with this)\r\n\r\nIn the public eye right now Wells Fargo isn't trusted.

If you just want to make a basic salary, no plans on moving or management, this is a for sure for you.  Pay checks are always on time, don't bounce and just being an employee gets you discounts with other companies.  \r\n\r\nThe only real winners in Sioux Falls are IT backgrounds.  They are in high demand here.  Here is how you win if you are IT, start in WF, spend 2 years here... leave for a different company, come back after 2 years you will be paid very well.  This is the only job category that it is possible to move up easily.\r\n\r\nYour first step up will come very quickly.  Example you will move from a Banker 1 to a Banker 2 within your first year.  Which seems like you are on the right path.  But....\r\nIf you want to shoot for the stars, and really move up... make your stay short, 1-3 years in Sioux Falls.  Get your feet wet and move on to another city and you will see more opportunities for advancement.  I'm not talking about moving to Fargo or Omaha, you will have to move to St. Louis, Charlotte, New York, Denver... something with actual variety. If you have any ambition of moving up... you cannot stay here, you have to move on to a bigger market.\r\n\r\nBenefits are cheap and with BC/BS it is accepted anywhere, Amount of PTO you get at Wells Fargo is unmatched  (You get 4 weeks to start then 5 in your 3rd year). \r\n6% 401K match... you wont find many companies that will be this high.\r\nCo-workers are fantastic in any area.\r\n90% of the managers really care about you.  Odds are you will get a good one.\r\nOnce you get to management you made it.  Your pay will be great and your workload can go to zero if you have a good team.  Often see them walk around or leave for two hours at a time because their is nothing for them to do.\r\nSenior management are smart and drive the company forward.  (get to their cons below) Don't just listen to the media about the CC fraud.  Those people were absolute crooks and should be in jail.  WF has cleared them out (hopefully) and has made great efforts to make things right.  Those individuals represent a fraction of a percent of the employees here.  They were the bad egg that needed to be thrown out. \r\n\r\nThis next part is for a smaller group, and i don't mean to offend anyone.  Just trying to give you a one up on everyone.\r\n\r\nIf you are a part of a minority group, and you are a good employee... you have a leg up.  Sioux Falls area is so plain vanilla, and WF has been on a huge diversity kick, if you are not part of a majority you will be sought after.  For initial hire, promotions, leadership groups, you name it.  Again i don't mean to offend anyone by this comment, and I may have, I apologize, just giving you information so you can make your choice to pursue WF as an employer.\r\n\r\nWF is a huge company in almost every city in the US.  You want to move and stay with WF... you have that opportunity.\r\n\r\nMaternity/Paternity leave is now 4 months... yes guys get it too.\r\n\r\nAccommodating to people with disabilities.", "cons": "PTO - Some departments it is very hard to use PTO, most areas in Sioux Falls are call center based so you will have deal with a waiting list for popular days off (holidays M, F, Sat, Sun,)  Good luck with those requests as it is not based on a local level only, you factor in other call centers around the U.S, so you are competing against everyone for the day off.\r\n\r\nAdvancement - very little opportunity.  You are playing the waiting game, doesn't matter how hard you work, how educated you are, or whatever extras you do... you are waiting for someone to retire, move, or take a different job.  We are not talking about 1-2 years, it is more like 5-6.  Sure they will open up new positions every now and then, but they are not advancements... you may see a 1-2K bump in pay but it is essentially the same job, but with more things to do that your manager does not want to.\r\nOnce you reach management you are set, but getting to management is close to impossible.  They will hire from outside the company instead of hiring within for management.  If they do hire from within, you are competing against 20-30 other applicants, and most of your co-workers.  Some managers don't care to learn what their employees do, they are just there to manage and if you get one of them they will let you know that.  Your team lead is always a better option for questions.\r\nGetting hire for a team lead position is just as difficult.  This is most always hired from within but again you are always competing against (depending on the size of your department) 20-50 people for the job including most of your co-workers.\r\n\r\nPay - the later you start the better. You will see new hires making more than you.  Once you are hired you are stuck with the pay, if you are a top employee you will be asked to help train new hires that are making $1-2/ hour more than you.  Bringing this up to management is pointless.  They will tell you there is nothing they can do, wont even make a pitch to HR for you saying you deserve it.  Remember, senior management (corporate) get bonuses based on how much money they make/save the company.  They would rather put $100 in their pocket than $4-5000 in yours.  They are located in another city, and don't have to look you in the eye every day so they feel no guilt. \r\n\r\nWF knows this but doesn't care, you will be paid 20% less to do your job here in Sioux Falls than it cost in other cities.  Not because the cost of living is higher, Sioux Falls cost of living is just as high as most major cities in the U.S.  Look it up you will be surprised,  it is because they don't want to pay you what your cost of living actually is.   They move jobs here because we work for less.. maybe that is our fault.\r\n\r\nYou are expendable, unfortunately.  They will hire a new person to do your job, loyalty does not always get you anywhere.   Call center environments are just like that... next man up.\r\n\r\nMost departments have a points system they use for unexcused absences.  If you are tarty or miss too many days you can be terminated.  This would make sense right??? but they take it to the extreme.  I have seen at least 50 fantastic employees get terminated because their child got sick too many times and they had to miss work because school/daycare will not allow the child to attend while sick.  If your manager is one that follows the book exactly, you will be on a verbal warning in your first year, if you have kids that get sick from time to time.  They will constantly remind you of your attendance status.  This also has driven 100 or more other good employees, that I have seen, to seek a new jobs because there is no flexibility in their policies.  Managers don't seem to have to follow these rules, they can come and go as they please... they don't practice what they preach.  If you are in a call center, they go off the time you log into your phone, so they have a record down to the second of when you started your day.  Parents/Guardians with children, may want to look elsewhere... the extra $1 an hour would not be worth the stress to join WF."}, {"review_title": "Company that is ONLY about the money", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, 401k, paid time off", "cons": "Over worked, high turn over rate,"}, {"review_title": "Really enjoy working here.

In addition to telling them they (probably) aren't getting many, if any, fees reversed (which is understandable to those who don't bother to keep tabs on their spending, and actually think the bank is supposed to do that for them) But to make matters worse, you are then expected to upsell, oops I mean \"refer\" those angry, hostile people over to next level sales for some other product they either really don't want or ultimately won't qualify for. (Example: Person who takes Direct Deposit Advance at 120% interest, and then has to keep taking them over and over because they've extended themselves and it's an endless cycle.  You recommend they take out a line of credit or credit card. Most know when they won't qualify hence taking out a 120% APR payday advance.)  Training was okay, although you are talked down to as if (or just in case this is) your first job.  Once you are on the phones, you are stuck in a dark cubicle all day every day taking these negative calls, with no real time for comeraderie or to even say hello to your fellow employees.  The word monotonous does not even begin to describe the job.  You felt guilty even going to use the restroom if it wasn't break or lunch because your supervisor is alerted when you aren't taking calls, so that plus Q.A. monitoring basically means you are micromanaged electronically and tied to your desk.  (Interestingly, there was a class action settlement recently from another department for this very infraction.)  Like most sales jobs, supervisors are promoted based not on how well they can manage people, but how many sales they made.  You can be a great salesperson but an awful manager and vice-versa.  Those are two separate skill sets.  I got along fine with my manager, but most did not like her (behind her back.)

Really we have come to the point where we have to sell \"internet checking accounts,\" \"travel checking accounts,\" and don't forget the \"bill pay account\" None of these lead to customer loyalty which is ultimately what banking is about. The fact of the matter is that Wealthy clients will stay with a bank based on customer service and rates, not having eight products which include online banking, bill pay and a debit card. I have seen more money flow out of the bank due to low rates than I have seen new accounts open. Management encourages poor behavior by rewarding those who game the system. The only problem with this is that I wonder how much money this bank loses due to the fact that checking accounts get opened and closed on a quarterly basis. If someone loses a check, guess what that's a new account even though every banker knows they transfer account. Having trouble with overdrafts. Let's close out your old account and open up a new one so we can start with a clean slate. Lost a debit card, let's close it out and order a new one, solution. You're in college and and your broke, have you thought about opening up a bill pay account.

Oh and don't forget to jump into January, where you'll absolutely have to annoy you're friends and family by opening up 10 accounts on January 1st, but it's cool you'll close them out at the start of the quarter and they'll never receive fees.

After being there a few months, you can now approach other Financial Institutions for jobs and be seriously considered.", "cons": "Where to begin. First off, unlike any other bank in existence, WF believes you have to stand your ENTIRE shift, and sometimes those were 10/11 hour shifts if you worked open-close (usually 7:45-6:45/7PM). There is something about standing that WF thinks makes it too \"impersonal\" when working with customers. Although several customers used to ask why I wasn't sitting. That always bugged me, I'm okay with standing for my shift, but when it is 10 hours with just one 1-hour lunch break? (Yeah, don't ask for your 15 minute break required by law, you will be laughed at)\r\n\r\nSecond, management expected you to do more than what you were paid to do. Including taking on part of their job. I wasn't there for more than 2 months before I was training a new teller. The Lead Tellers didn't want to train the new people so it was the other tellers who had to pick up the slack. After all my unofficial management and training experience, I applied for the Lead Teller position, only for it to be given to the manager's friend.\r\n\r\nThird, their \"commission\" is ridiculous. It's based on quarters, and I would be lucky if my \"commission bonus\" was over $200. That was meeting the quotas and reaching \"Gold\" for several of the Quarters. This is the reason they pay so low, is because they promise commission. I was embarrassed to tell my other Teller friends, working at the other two Big Banks (Chase & BofA) how much my hourly was because chances were they were making $2-3 more an hour, not including their commission.\r\n\r\nManagement is weakly trained, and have unreal expectations. Most managers I encountered had no inkling of Management Philosophy and how to lead a team. Their decisions were poor and unfounded and drove people away from WF. Wells Fargo mostly promotes from within, but only using the buddy system. The people that got promoted knew the hiring manager and were friends with them. It was never based off of qualifications, because the best employees always left for better paying jobs after being ignored for so long. It ended up being a redundant cycle of nepotism promotions, which can be very discouraging, as you can imagine.\r\n\r\nHuman Resources, both regional and national, will always back up management and find a reason why the employees were the ones at fault. Even after a letter and a formal complaint was signed and sent to Human Resources.

These threats are often issued as a blanket statement to the entire \"team\", frequently at meetings.\r\nSales goals are extremely aggressive.  Be prepared to make every interaction you have with a customer about finding a \"solution\" for them (\"solution\" being the company jargon for banking product).\r\nIf you wish to advance in the retail side of things, be prepared to completely sacrifice your life to this company.  Store managers seem to be expected to put in 60+ hour work weeks.  Other managers can expect 50 or more hours weekly.  Bankers and lead tellers can also expect their work weeks to routinely go well over the 40 hour mark.  Pay does not seem to reflect these demands at this level.  Additionally, the company seems to be expanding business hours at their retail locations on approximately an annual basis.  Anyone who still believes in the myth of \"banker's hours\" really should not even consider this as employment.\r\nEvaluations for an individual's level of customer service are arbitrary at best.  Customers are called after an interaction with an individual bank employee and are asked to rate their interaction with that employee.  Great in theory, but in reality, unless you receive a perfect rating on every aspect of the survey, you have completely and utterly failed.  The rating is also only supposed to be rated on the service given by the particular employee- not the customer's feeling towards the company, another location, another employee, the current light in which banks in general are viewed or any other factor.  The simple fact of the matter is if the survey is given by a customer who has any problem with the company whatsoever, they have found their outlet for their frustrations, and what they think of the service you gave them is totally irrelevant.  As an example, a survey was given for a teller who corrected a problem created by an error made by a different teller at a different branch.  The end result?  The teller correcting the problem received a very low rating due to the customer's frustration the problem ever happened, though when queried by management, the customer said he was very happy with the service provided at the time of the correction.  The result for the teller?  Meetings and counselings to correct the problems with the service she provided."}, {"review_title": "Don't be fooled, you may have a good experience but a some point you will gave a bad experience and it will be miserable", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Apr 2011", "job_title": "Collector, Collections Supervisor, Bank Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Time off, if you can get it when YOU need it.

I was fortunate enough to get a referral from a friend and I was able to get things going pretty quickly. I went in and personally introduce myself to the branch manager and the private banker; 2 really nice guys that seemed thrilled to have a transferring team member. Now this is where things went south. I was called up by the recruiter to discuss when I could start and what my starting salary would be.. For whatever reason she asked me what starting wage I'd prefer. I asked for 16.00 so we could negotiate. She told me '12.50' which from what I understood was the starting wage for a new WF Teller employee. I had been with the company for over 2 years. On top of that she talked back to me like it was some sort of joke that I would be asking for anything more. \"Being an employee for 2 years doesn't suffice for a wage higher than $12.50\" she tells me. She was condescending and talked to me like what I was asking would have people jumping through hoops. I caved and took the 12.50 starting wage.. because after all I cut my commute in more than half and I can establish a relationship with my new branch in hopes to get a promotion. 6 months down the road and I apply for the PB1 position. My sales this quarter are number 1 compared to others at the teller line. I get a recruiting call from the same indifferent, condescending \"recruiter\" pretty much telling me that I can't even be considered for a promotion because I didn't comp for Q3 which was the time I transitioned between branches; A BRAND NEW POLICY THEY JUST STARTED GOING BY WHEN THEY SWITCHED DM'S A MONTH PRIOR. She basically said that the one quarter I didn't comp in my entire WF career was the reason they couldn't promote me. At this point I am seeing too many red flags with this company. So in these two instances I have learned that Wells Fargo saved a few thousand dollars on NOT sending a new hire to training and putting me (an employee that has been with the company for over 2 years) on the same wage, and that the policies that are rapidly changing are making it far more difficult to move up in the company."}, {"review_title": "The managers don't have a clue", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "30 Jan 2015", "job_title": "HPS in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The managers and employees are grossly under trained in the loss mitigation department.

Then you must recommend a product to the customer, and to make sure you did, you have to have a \"mid-session review\" with your branch manager (i.e., they check to make sure you are pushing a product on every single customer and will send you back to do so if you haven't). Then there is the customized summary that must be printed in duplicate, initialed by the customer, with their phone number included. These need to be turned in every night. Oh and most include the date and time of your next appointment, every single time. The point is, there is an expectation that ALL customers need a new product, a follow up appointment, and a full financial review (and a sale) with every customer, no matter if they have time, have just done that the week before, or need a product. The sales goals are so unrealistic that bankers end up having ethics issues, or they can't meet their sales goals and lose their job. If you are good at product pushing, many ethical transgressions are overlooked by management, until you have too many that it can't be covered up anymore and HR gets involved. There are ethical bankers to be sure, and successful ones at that, but they are the ones that work tirelessly to hit their goals, harassing friends and family to open accounts. Those individuals are rewarded with an ever dwindling incentive check, and the expectation that the next quarter, they will do even more. June 30th you might be on top of the world, the best of the best, but a few days into July, with the slowness of traffic due to vacations and the holiday, you are subjected to \"coaching\" regarding your sales performance. There is little to no reason to excel in your position, as you simply become a target for ethics violations reports from disgruntled co-workers, or are held to standards far above what is considered the minimum goal. Branch managers are not immune to this sort of pressure either,---the increased sales goals and sales pressure appear to come from the district and market levels. \r\nOverall, it's just a frustrating company to work for. There is no real sense of \"a good days work done\", because you really have no control over your own success.

The Wells Fargo vision is second to none, and although it seems like it doesn\u2019t always trickle down to everyone working on the sales floor, the ideas being implemented from up above are based on great values and good behavior. \r\n\r\nFor starters, Wells Fargo is an ideal place to begin a new career. As a student coming out of high school or college, there\u2019s almost something for everyone at Wells Fargo. You\u2019re sure to find something that fits your strengths in a company that has over 80 sub-divisions in it. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a good manager\u2019s duty to recognize your strengths and your talent and help you choose the right career path. Whether its private banking, investments or insurance, it\u2019s real easy to find an opportunity and move within the company.\r\n\r\nIn the Twin Cities area, there are many \u201cpoacher banks\u201d that steal away Wells Fargo employees that come out of training or have a bit of experience. It\u2019s simply because Wells Fargo\u2019s training program is truly exceptional. The automated systems, the wide variety and the size of the program itself are pretty amazing.\r\n\r\nBecause a majority of your day is spent at work, having friendly people that care to work with is important. Fortunately, I\u2019ve witnessed many friendships made through the Wells Fargo environment. \r\n\r\nFinally, the health benefits, and retirement plans are also top notch. Wells Fargo does have excellent health, vision and dental programs available for full time and part time employees, something that you don\u2019t see to often with even some of the other larger companies. Dont forget about the 20 days of Paid vacation you start with as a new employee or even 25 days that you can qualify for in the management level. Tuition reimbursement is available for full and part time employees as well! There are a lot more great reasons why you should start with Wells Fargo, but to get more information I'd stop in your local bank and talk to a manager about it.", "cons": "One of the downsides of working with Wells Fargo, like any other company is that if your manager lacks the talent and capability of helping his employees develop, you can become complacent and even bored with your job. A good manager keeps his employees challenged, and unfortunately I've witnessed some managers not being able to do that. \r\nAlthough a lot of benefits are offered for team members in regards to retirement accounts, health benefits and etc, I wish there was a larger discount on home loans, auto loans and some of the other products available through the bank.\r\nDepending on which part of the company you end up working for, on the banking side at least I know that with all the different systems, programs and various software in place, things can definitely get confusing. Having a go to mentor is always helpful.\r\nThe environment can also get a little too sales oriented as well. Team members forget they have to take care of the customer and start concentrating on hitting their numbers and projections.\r\nAlthough most incentives and bonuses are achievable and realistic, I do believe there is some room for improvement when it comes to dollar amounts."}, {"review_title": "Fantastic Perks, Boring Work, A Few Fun People, Safe Place To Be A Lifer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Jun 2008", "job_title": "Applications Engineer in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Perks, 5 week vacations (25 work days, includes some holidays), financial compensation.

I have done cold-call telemarketing before and to me this job feels nothing like it.  However if you treat this job as though you are a cold-call telemarketer you can do very well.  The moving package is okay although not as good as it used to be.  I don't like that our pension plans disappeared last year...not sure how that's going to figure into my eventual retirement plans.  For 2009 there were several very heavily weighted portions of all us managers' reviews that had to do with company performance and not individual or branch performance.  These measures actually made it mathmatically impossible to reach the highest rating, even if one scored perfectly in every single area that they could affect directly.

BONUSES.", "cons": "It is clear to me after hearing horror stories from others about their branch, that your outlook on the job will have a lot to do with your managers, sales/CS skills, your general attitude, and location. The managers at my branch are amazing. They mean business, but treat you like a human being and with respect they laugh and joke have fun but are serious about their job. I don't have a manager creepin' over my shoulder all day. But they do give us a lot of feedback on our performance EVERYDAY. If you can learn to see their feedback as coaching in order to make you more successful, their constant coaching will not bother you. I worked in call centers so this type of feedback and performance improvement approach is not unfamiliar to me. \r\n     They set sales goals pretty high, but are not COMPLETELY unattainable. In sales, you don't always have a good day, they know that, you know that, so don't let high sales goals bother you, just do your best and keep trying. If your managers are \"micromanagers\" I am sorry, but I don't have them. \r\n     They tend to promote people with sales skills and don't really look at their leadership abilities as much. This is because people with high sales make the managers look good and in turn basically reflect your overall performance. Managers that make promotional decisions will naturally choose to promote those who produce and make them look good. High sales is how you get recognized by not only your direct managers, but with upper managers you hardly see. Unfortunately, this may put people into management that lack leadership ability and don\u2019t know how to handle pressure from the Big Shots. They are unable to turn it into feedback that a line employee can embrace, benefit, and develop from. This is not the fault of Wells Fargo as a whole, but a reflection of your managers\u2019 leadership capability. \r\n     What I can say is they do not provide much SALES SPECIFIC training. They talk about how to offer products, but then say that you don't need to know too much about the products, just enough to get them over to a banker. Which is cool, but there are still some necessary things about sales that are required to be successful as a teller that they don't teach. \r\n     Your customers will always say \"I don't have time\"\u2026 well you need to convince them that they do have the time and that their time spent is worth it. Unfortunately, this company does not do very well in teaching you how to do that. I've had to use my previous sales experience in order to be successful at this. Typically, the tellers at my branch ask questions like-- \u201cHas anybody told you about this?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have an account?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to start an account?\u201d \u201cThis will really benefit you cuz it\u2019s awesome\u201d-- while these are great attempts at offering products, they are in no way successful. \r\n     Oh, and you have to stand on your feet ALL DAY and be really careful with your money handling. If you don\u2019t have experience in handling money, be prepared. Just take your time and be thorough. Training  in general is lacking compared to the results they want out of tellers. They\u2019d rather constantly coach then fully prepare the person before they hit the floor.

There does seem to be a minor catch-22 for employees who remain within the same position for more than 5 years.   If he or she takes a new internal position, there seems to be a company policy that limits the cap the maximum salary increase for the new position at 12% the salary of the old position.    For many incremental promotions, this isn't an issue.   For those rare circumstances where an employee jumps both \"job families\" and \"levels\", this can result in a rather large disparity.  Good managers have mechanisms to offer mid-year adjustments to accelerate compensation in cases like this, but the oversight and scrutiny on the business justification is rather burdensome.   Some employees who have been with Wells Fargo for many years may find it easier to leave for 6mo and return, if they like the company and want to dramatically adjust their income toward the mid-point for their job families."}], [{"review_title": "While it was Wachovia  it was the best employer in Jacksonville, Florida", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "18 Feb 2015", "job_title": "Client Service Consultant in Jacksonville, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits 401k matchup to 6 %  of salary, paid vacation and 9 paid Holidays, Wachovia had a pension plan and Wells only has a cash balance plan..", "cons": "Worked for wachovia many many years and Wells bought Wachovia in 2008 and continued to work for Wells until I retired in 2011, took retirement because my entire department was displaced by Wells Fargo.

I believe this company has the right ideals on the surface, but counteract those ideals when it comes to expectations. For example, WF is highly visionary when it comes to providing the \"WOW\" experience but gut you when it comes to how quickly you have to get the customers out the door to get another one in for a sale. You have to become the wolf dressed in the grandmothers clothes. You have to think of ulterior motives while putting on the happy-faced mask otherwise your sales/numbers won't make it. You can't think like someone who just likes to be helpful and is a people-pleaser. WF wants you to be the latter, but it doesn't work that way in the front lines. For those of you who have worked in sales, you know what I mean. Benefits are horrible now. They used to be decent, but were recently changed. Vision is good but medical is terrible and expensive and little options to really change.

My former service manager made it nigh impossible for us to provide satisfactory service to our customers. She would hover over our shoulders in order to witness an offer. She would high jack transactions and whisper in our ears of all the offers she wanted us to make. This frequently made our customers uncomfortable, as if something was wrong with their transaction.

Top company for LGBT communities, minorities, women, etc. They are very focused on diverstiy.", "cons": "There is a disconituity between top leadership and mid-level management. Ex. a new system rolled out that was a difficult transition for many employees. Top level leadership had the vision of the new system being a tool to assist bankers with improving the customer experience, but the only way the company was able to measure use was through completion statistics. Regional managers therefore set ridiculous goals for usage of the system. Coaching was around \"why weren't you 100%), rather than focusing on the completed transactions and how they went, and how they helped the banker and customer. This created a very negative attitude toward the new system on the bankers part, and they frequently \"fake\" the completion without actually following the process, simply to get regional management off their back. This just equals no improvement for the customer experience, with more busy work for the bankers- not the vision that leadership had set forth. \r\n\r\nSales, sales, sales. That is really all Wells Fargo cares about. There was a recent scandal in California because bankers were cheating to make their sales goals. This was a year after I left, but I was not surprised in the least- I had employees who transferred from California (where all of the top regions in the company are located) and I was stunned by their practices- what they thought was normal protocal was actually flagrant violations of the company's code of ethics. The pressure is intense, and the focus is always on quantity, never quality. Likewise, customer service scores are measured on a pass/fail basis- either a score is perfect or considered a failure (despite the customers giving a rating of 1-5), which is very discouraging to employees. \r\n\r\nThere is a major disconnect between each market. This, on one hand, could be a good thing, as the company believes in letting managers \"run their own business.\" For me, I was in a market run by a very strict leader who saw no room for fun and was entirely focused on exceeding all of the company's goals and ranking #1. This is not necessarily true for every market of course, but I know there are a lot of significant differences between markets. My RM required pantyhose to be worn year round- even in the dog days of summer- where other markets were much more lenient. It all depends on where you are. \r\n\r\nLack of opportunity to grow. Each line of business is like it's own company, and they like to promote from within.

There is absolutely no loyalty and being great at your job means nothing.\r\n\r\nDue to some recent policy changes in HR, it is nearly impossible to fire someone, which may sound like job security, but if you care about your work, it means you will work with people who don't care, can't operate the software, and/or have bad attitudes.

The stores still have unrealistic goals set to never hit payout or bonus which are a huge part of the promised earnings to be had. Also the staffing is bare bones. So if someone gets sick, takes a vacation, or is loaned out to another store, everyone pays for it by having to produce more. Management doesn't care if you are short staffed they only care about why you didn't hit a number goal. Even if you are a great worker with a great attitude and customers love you, if the upper managements ego isn't stroked you are going no where. Don't ever work in a slow or smaller local community store because the ranking or goals for individual performance are only set by the performance of the bigger stores. So you will never hit your goals in a small town community bank. My last thing. This is a great job for single people who have little to no responsibility. But for people with families there is no work life balance, it is all work balance with no life. You can work other places with less responsibility for more money.

They are also laying off many sales partners that do not meet a dollar funded amount, which favors those sales partners who work in wealthier areas, ultimately hurting those who work with and in poorer areas.

At Wells Fargo employees and customers are not people ,they are numbers, and prepare to be scrutinized for every detail as everything is broken into numbers, and those that don't reach their numbers prepare to get written off. The only people that do matter are the wealthy individuals who will receive the lowest interests rates and even discounts for having so much wealth, whereas poorer individuals struggling to make payments on their already Wells Fargo loans, get denied, thus increasing the chance that they will fall behind, instead of helping them we turn our backs to them... after we received their money.

It doesn't seem to matter if the customer doesn't benefit from the loan, acct, etc; nor management seem to worry much about the overall revenue impact (for example, bankers are sell equity lines, credit cards, etc to customers that state clearly they don't want to have or use them)- incurring set up costs(appraisals, back office underwriting, etc) that are paid by the bank, with no revenue being generated.  The only focus is on the quarterly numbers of new accounts opened and loans generated.\r\n\r\nWithin the wealth management group, there is still an aggressive focus on sales; the investment managers, brokers, and trust team members are paid primarily from fees and revenue that they generate on an annual basis, so there is a strong incentive to keep all clients in accounts that charge annual management fees as a percentage of assets, even when the accounts aren't actively managed- trades are only executed a handful of times a year, so a client would spend much less if they paid per transaction, but again, this is strongly discouraged.\r\n\r\nTeam members are not encouraged in any way to take ownership of the company- there used to be an expression \"run it like you own it\", that is no longer used.  The entry level to mid level managers are underpaid and overworked, and typically don't have much experience, so there is very little direction or mentoring, it's very much learn as you go, and if your sales numbers drop for a quarter, expect to have your job threatened, even if you've performed above standard for years prior.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, office politics are a huge issue; gossip and backstabbing seem to be everyday events, especially as you move up to and past the VP level.

Basically, by helping you are only meeting one of a few possible criteria, but this doesn't mean you are actually mathematically helping them.

Sale goals aren't realistic I'm got against growth but not all the products  don't work for everyone  for an example   an 82 yr old customer who enjoys coming to the bank to do all his/her banking needs and have no clue about the internet will not use online banking  because when u know the customer well enough it makes no sense to pressure him/her into getting it. Also if you don't meet goals for the week prior be prepared for an extra early meeting as to why you haven't and still have to work a full shift following it. Retail and banking is different, your customers don't need so many accounts.

We are told that we \"don't manage by the numbers, but by behaviors\" but the only behavior I can look forward to each day is a withering critique by an \"Area Manager\" . The avergae age in our stores is 25-why? Because they recruit from Verizon Stores the only skill a banker needs is the ability to BS a client into signing up for things they don't need. Accounts are opened up wrong and in violation of laws and regulations- but thats ok- you hit your numbers and stay employed. Ethics go out the window. Buyer beware..As a store manager be prepared to work 6 days a week, have conference calls each day at 8am and again at 6pm. Be prepared to work in a store that is short staffed due to turnover, and the staff that is in place is clueless"}, {"review_title": "horrible company", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great health, dental, and 401K plan.

He didn't want anyone using a debit card to access the corporate account.   The person that opened the account had ordered the card so he could get two product sales rather than one.   It was not a great  start for the relationship.\r\n\r\nManagement is always trying to fix things that are not broken.  Stupid promotional gimmicks  that employees were expected to participate in.   Annually they provide stuffed horses to bankers who are expected to hand them  out as favors.   I had to take a stuffed animal to a CEO of a major corporation as a thank you for his business.   He looked at me  like \"what the hell is this\".  I was expected to report the on the success of this project which was another waste of time.\r\n\r\nManagement  is very inconsistent.    There is always something \"extra\" to do.  Just let employees do their jobs without the distractions.   FYI tellers are expected to sell  7 products each day.   Try cashing a $10 check without getting a sales pitch.  It won't happen.\r\n\r\nThey discriminate against higher paid experienced employees.   In my  department they fired 3 out of 4 experienced senior relationship bankers and replaced them with 30 year old kids at lower saleries.  The  person that replaced me hand not paid a personal visit to my largest client 6 months after he  took over my portfolio.  The client was offended.  Stepping over dollars to pick up  pennys.   There is a huge turnover.   After 1 year I had seniority  over half of the bankers in my department.\r\n\r\nFinally, all ideas come  from the top down.   Suggestions for improvement  from non-management employees are ignored.   Management is actually offended if you raise an issue.  I pointed out that they were overcharging for Attorney Trust accounts and just about got fired."}, {"review_title": "Back Office Employee", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Dec 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a big company so there are always perks.
