It is definitely there and you have to produce solutions by identifying customer's potential needs and referring him to a banker.

You are trained to identify those needs; you do get help from peers, managers and bankers, often they talk to the customer on my behalf and it is still my solution; you are getting paid extra for new solutions; I also found that quite often customers can indeed benefit from them so it is not just to sell whatever for the sake of sale. Finally, do not sell your soul for solutions: persuading your relatives to open accounts may help now but will do nothing good for you next week or month.

I applied for dozens of internal positions hoping to get promoted after graduating, only to be shot down and receive the standard rejection letter over and over. Don't expect upward mobility. \r\n\r\nOn top of all that, pay was below the industry average. They tried \"making up\" for it with quarterly incentives based on production targets (selling unnecessary bank accounts) and customer service ratings (where if the customer gives anything less than a 5 on a survey scaled 1-5, the employee gets an F and a private meeting with the managers).

No matter how foul a person can be, if they're good at kissing butt, your life will be miserable (again, don't bother going to HR about racist or sexist comments because they will not be taken seriously- you'll only get viewed as a complainer or a \"problematic\" employee.\r\n3) I am so sick and tired of all the propaganda about diversity and growth and supporting internal talent! Such a load of poo!!! This bank ALWAYS hires externally (except for when a VP hires his friend's kid as a favour in which case even deserving undergrads with no connections do not have a chance). \r\n4) There is NO diversity in sales- its all white males. And for those diverse analysts and associates, they get squeezed out cause it\u2019s a white boys club- its so toxic and pathetic.

In particular, there is a woman in senior leadership that runs projects and governance initiatives- she lovessss sitting at the boys table (even though she doesn\u2019t actually bring any value) and will step and tear down any other females that intimidates her. She will PUBLICLY HUMILATE other women just cause deep down she knows she\u2019s threatened. But will flirt and act all cute with the men in the room. \r\n6) The \u201cRISK\u201d group is a bunch of clowns. Such a joke. Nobody knows what they\u2019re doing. I can\u2019t wait for Charlie to get rip them apart. It\u2019s a bunch of morons hiring their friends from back home who can barely speak a word of English. If you walk past them, all you\u2019ll hear is them speaking in their own language and you have no idea if they\u2019re making fun of you or talking about work. And I don\u2019t know if they actually ever even do anything they\u2019re always standing around the kitchen talking and laughing. This place is a joke. \r\n7) If you\u2019re not part of the Corporate Investment banking team, you\u2019re a joke and made fun of by everyone on the team from the interns, to associates, to RMs and even the MDs make fun of everyone behind their back. Its so toxic. \r\n8) nobody gets a raise or promotion \u2013 unless you threaten to quit. Actually, you may not even get a promotion that way. I have no idea how anyone progresses at this place. \r\n9) they are so CHEAPPPPPPPPPPPP!!! No Christmas party, no lunches, no happy hour, ITS LITERALLY WORK HARD and zero play. Works out if you\u2019re completely emotionless though and don\u2019t care for any recognition. \r\n10) also, their education reimbursement is dumb. Nobody gives it out because it comes out of that team\u2019s AU, and nobody wants to approve that because that means it\u2019s a cut from everyone else\u2019s bonus and you get questioned as to why your AU has so many expensive. The bank doesn\u2019t actually have funds set aside for education or growth so while they talk about helping you grow, they also make you feel like poo when you ask them to pay up. \r\n11) They just fired a bunch of people and think moral stayed the same.
