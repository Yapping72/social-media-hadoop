Decent PTO and holidays. Management generally let's you work flex time - I am not a morning person and generally didn't get to work before 9am. My manager never gave me a hard time about it as long as I got 40 hours in. Bonus was about 10% of my base as long as quality was good. Also I felt that quality control was generally pretty fair in their reviews, although others disagree with me on that. Overall I was appreciative to have this job.", "cons": "Not able to get your DE unless you worked in a particular physical office in 2 states only; lots of regulation impact on employees - such as, not allowed to use excel (seriously, and if you were caught using excel worksheets you were in trouble), random mid-year in-person interviews by internal auditors; training was rough - not enough access to help when needed and the corporate trainor didn't even know how to use the lending software - sent us back totally unprepared ; they use a program called \"core\" for underwriting and it is glitchy (for example, when the last condition is cleared the loan will automatically CTC itself. So let's say you cleared all uw conditions, but the title and appraisal were not in file yet. Those come in later and get cleared by the collateral review team. Without any warning, your loan issues it's own clear to close status. This causes you to miss anything new added to the loan before the loan gets audited by QC. Also, once a loan is in CTC status it can never be moved back. So if the loan suddenly isn't ctc anymore (let's say documents expired), it will stay in CTC status, making it hard to manage your pipeline/be aware of the true status of a loan.  Also- the system \"recommends\" a document to be attached to a condition and people overseas will attach conditions at 2am. (Processors don't really process here, they just resubmit loans when they see that the system recommended a document to a condition). No control at all over what processors do. Underwriter essentially becomes the processor much of the time. Finally, exceptions to credit policy were painstaking to request. Long turn time to get a reply and the system would lock you from making any changes, including canceling the request!

Do not be befooled by all the positive reviews above because Wells fargo has recently had a change in technical leadership and it is for the worst. The cons I have listed below have started in almost all teams in my BU and suddenly you can see lot of resignations in the organisation in India.\n\n1.) The US managers (who are mostly Indians) treat you like slaves. There is no end time for you to log off. It might extend till 3-4 in the morning.\n\n2.) The US managers are not open to discussions. One reason is they are purely non technical guys who worked as traders in the bank.\n\n3.) Too much micromanagement from US leads and especially manager.\n\n4.) Agile is just for the sake of it and is hardly followed. No one cares about story points, acceptance criteria etc.\n\n5.) No retrospective meetings.  No sprint planning meetings.\n\n6.) Deadlines are decided by manager and NOT by developers who will be working on it. They ALWAYS have crunch timelines and you will be questioned for task completion  from the next day of starting the task.\n\n7.) Hardly any focus on quality of work because there is always a strict timeline and most of the US developers are contractors. Their projects are of 1-1.5 year duration so people focus on delivering quickly compromising quality because of fear of escalations.\n\n8.)

Luckily for me I was able to pass them, if you fail any of these tests you will be let go from your contract. Once passing all the tests you will be interviewed for the role. The job is pretty much guaranteed at this point since they spent the money getting you licensed for the role. As most of you know already, these particular licenses enable you to provide financial advice regarding investments such as Mutual Funds. However, in this specific role you\u2019re unable to give any advice. There are 3 products you get to discuss with customers which would be a Wells Trade Account, Intuitive investor, or offering a phone based or full service FA. The customer has to decide which of these options is best for them. As the licensed associate you\u2019re not able to tell them what would be best, oftentimes this creates an awkward experience between you and the customer because they\u2019re looking at you to be the expert and know what would be best suited for them. The role is basic and becomes mundane fast. \r\n\r\nExpect to be taking back to back calls for your entire shift. \r\nExpect to repeat disclosures on every call. \r\nExpect your calls to be reviewed constantly and brought to your attention if you failed to state verbatim one of the 5+ disclosures. \r\nExpect to work Saturdays if you\u2019re new. \r\nExpect to be in the role for a very long time, I was in the role for 2 years. I was constantly looking to get into an analytical role. Despite being in the role 2 years I was unable to interview for any other position I applied for internally. As for my colleagues they experienced the same problems regarding internal promotions. \r\nExpect your manager to miss all your 1 on 1 meetings. \r\nExpect to be a number and a droid. \r\nExpect upset customers, as most customers resent WFA for the scandals and disorganized client services group. \r\nExpect to regret the job you have chosen. \r\n\r\nOn the final note I wanted to share the moment I was working Saturday in March 2020, when the COVID pandemic was on the rise and a stay at home order was issued by the NC governor. During work on Saturday a gentlemen in a hazmat suit showed up at my desk, informing me they would be spraying because someone in a nearby cubicle had been quarantined for being in close contact with someone who had COVID. My colleague and I, who were the only 2 scheduled at the Charlotte site on that particular Saturday were flabbergasted to say the least. My lazy employer failed to mention to us they were spraying the building that day for COVID. My manager asked me for a picture of the gentleman in the hazmat suit, I took the photo on my cellphone sent it to my boss. He told us to leave immediately and that we would be compensated for a full day of work. Later my boss calls my personal cell on my time to tell me the photos I have taken were illegally obtained, since I took the photos on private property. He asked me to delete the photos and call any of my family members I sent them to, so they could also delete them from their phones. Unbelievable, right? \r\n\r\nAnyway don\u2019t work for this company, anyone who currently works there in the ICC contact centers will be in my prayers.
