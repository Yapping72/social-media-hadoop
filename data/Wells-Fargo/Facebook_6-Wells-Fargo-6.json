The amazing thing is they have not grown as an organization in those past two decades. The same dominance-based structure is firmly in place - one that withholds information from the employees in order to allow the managers to feel they are in control. Perhaps they believe they are adding value? It is a pretty sad state of affairs when territorialism and protecting your image are the main goals of the so-called leadership (in actuality, 'rudderless ship' is the best analogy). Saul van Beurden is very compelling and seems open minded and helpful - but the reality is you will never work for anyone like him. Your managers will be barely literate and emotionally stunted individuals who never say 'Thank You' or acknowledge your work ('No, folks - a paycheck really is not enough!').\r\n\r\nPurportedly they are implementing Agile but it is really Agile in name only; the teams are completely disempowered and unable to plan given the shifting requirements and paucity of information. Again, it feels like this is a control issue where the many levels of weak management don't want to face their approaching obsolescence.\r\n\r\nSad state of affairs - so many people wasting their lives working in meaningless job.
