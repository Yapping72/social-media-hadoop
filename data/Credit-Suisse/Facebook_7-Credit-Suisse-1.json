high turnover in teams in the department and other part of organization - Difficult development for a individual contributor (technical specialization path). Practically promotion is very limited if you're not considering managerial position as a part of your career path. - Currently organization is under heavy organizational change, so there will be more pressure on efficiency / deliverables based on the same people who will need to deliver. - It's a corporation - overhead for getting some dependencies you need to met, to get your own things done is significant. There was some undergoing work to reduce this, and make some processes easier, but you still need some time to get know all internal systems and a lot of other processes in other part of organization to be able to get your things done.

Don't bother coming here for a new start at a new company unless you want to start at square one.\n- No real commitment to doing anything correctly that can't be solved by outsourcing or purchasing (what is hoped to be) turnkey tech\n- I would say only 1 manager I had of the 4 over the course of my 3 year tenure was palatable as a human being. The remainder were misanthropes with very little desire to see you succeed in any way unless it benefited themselves.\n- No real mobility. If you are on a project you will be on it until you go job searching on their internal boards to get re-hired in a different area. A process with almost no difference between being hired externally from what I could tell. Almost feels like a completely separate businesses at times. \n- Raises are non-existent and and promotions are largely tenure based regardless of them speaking of merit based. At best you could consider this a blend of merit and tenure, but you'd have to survive the tenure first to get to the merit considerations.\n- There is little real structure and process in place on any projects and any external resources treat you exactly as you would expect in a matrix org that has been cost cutting for years in an effort to improve their profitability. Seeing as the infrastructure is littered with a glut of redundant tech often unimplemented or used, they clearly weren't cutting anything but human resources.\n- Not agile or dev ops compatible in reality though they certainly imagine they are headed their. Much of the upper management simply isn't present enough to recognize their own process let alone understand why they want to be Agile, what it means, and how they need to act for it to work.

Absolutely no storage or file space at workstations. No telephones on desks. Employees have to communicate via Skype for everything, even IT assistance! No one to call at HR, if you have a problem! No department secretary to help with onboarding! New employees must learn to navigate extremely cumbersome and unfriendly internal systems to process all their own onboarding documents! Also, be prepared to receive upwards of 400 emails (you heard me) every day! That's not an exaggeration! That is an average of the amount of emails you will receive daily, due to all the system generated emails of nearly every department in the bank! These emails will absolutely bury you, leaving you unable to focus on your work. Management simply pretends it isn't a problem, so don't even think of complaining:)\n\nManagement schedules department conference calls (sometimes multiple times a day!) tying up employees for hours, lecturing them on not achieving the department's goals, and trying to figure out how to make the employees work faster...Maybe not scheduling a two hour conference call, and tying up 35 people would be a good start?\n\nI worked in the Hedge Fund counterparty risk department, where they had the Archegos Fund blow-up in 2021. I was not there at the time, but it was very evident to me how something like that could have happened there. The entire department is run by managers who are driving blindly, concerned only with process and not actual counterparty risk. They are too concerned with catching the tiny, inconsequential errors that don't matter that they miss the big picture, the ticking time bombs like Archegos! It won't be the last one!\n\nThe team leader of my group was not very collegial or approachable. She did not like questions, and would frown on taking notes. I felt like I was walking on egg shells every day! I tried desperately to avoid asking her any questions because she would always have a snarky reply. The other team members were better, but many times were unresponsive. One of the senior managers in the department recruited me for the role, but once I started, he never spoke to me. I would try to arrange a meeting on his calendar, but at the last minute he would just cancel.\n\nIf you want to work in a dynamic, vibrant workplace with a lot of interaction with colleagues, don't work there! It is a frightful, dire, depressing place where the toxic corporate culture permeates down through the ranks. They might offer you more money, but don't fall for it...you will regret it!
