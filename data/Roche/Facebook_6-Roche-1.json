For example, one of the current ambitions is \"twice the access to medicines for half the cost to society\".\r\n- Roadmaps are courageous: several projects are radical, with timelines of 8+ years. I was positively surprised a few times by the willingness of leadership to take sharp decisions with short-term impact on revenue because they were \"the right thing\" going forward.\r\n- Challenging: most leverage the boundaries of state of the art research on chemistry, hardware and software.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the average employee base is extremely competent, quality-driven, and willing to fight for \"what's right\".\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is a lot of mobility within the company. Many people move around every 2-3 years, and people who strongly over-perform are often promoted quickly, or at least pushed up in salary very quickly.\r\n\r\nThis is hands-down the best company I ever worked for.

As a result it's not possible to get retested 9nce immunity is proven. I said this to management/HR and that my GP would not test me.

Roche has a tendency to promote people who deliver results and view management as a way to give a career path for top performers, instead of carefully considering management roles for people who have skills for the role. This is likely common in most industries, but I found middle managers at Roche to be obsessed with their own personal career ambitions as opposed to being considerate of those of their team. Some were boldly two-faced, showing their best side to their peers and superiors and worst to the team below, and often the only forum to account for this is the 2-year GEOS survey. But often middle managers fire employees to game their own management ranking, which has the added effect of ensuring subordination of those who remain on the team. That said Roche is extremely progressive in their HR policies, I would not be surprised to see them calibrate this over time, and Roche also offers phenomenal leadership development programs and continuing education to help build soft skills. The problem is the self-centered middle managers who are only thinking about their next career step, and a lack of opportunities for candid manager feedback outside of GEOS. Pay is also considerably lower than the market rate in the industry, but career opportunities and benefits are top-notch."}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Senior Business Systems Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent culture, \r\nbenefits\r\nGlobal company\r\nHelpful people", "cons": "Difficult to grow due to bureaucracy and slow paced nature"}, {"review_title": "Roche is the place to be", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Clinical Sciences Program Specialist in Tucson, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great opportunity to work and find more upward movement", "cons": "No con Roche is an amazing company"}, {"review_title": "good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great place to work, good benifits", "cons": "less salary, less rewards, less opportunity to grow"}], [{"review_title": "Very Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Business Controlling Manager in Istanbul", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Sustainable business and work ethic.", "cons": "Work life balance, competitive salary."}, {"review_title": "Enjoy working here", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Key Account Manager in Christchurch, Canterbury", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Challenging, great to keep up with information and technology", "cons": "Difficult with new computer software often"}, {"review_title": "Great company overall", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "24 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Senior Manager in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Long term corporate goals, great vision, company culture, and benefit", "cons": "murky decision making process, complex matrix organizational structure"}, {"review_title": "GSM role", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Global Studies Manager in Welwyn Garden City, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible working (mix between office and home)", "cons": "Not competitive pay when compared with other Pharma companies."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "15 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "invests in personal and leadership development", "cons": "heavy on process and understaffed in some sections"}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Manufacturer Process Operator in Oro Valley, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "benefits if you make it to full time status", "cons": "the pay off is not competitive enough for contractors coming in"}, {"review_title": "Great Place To Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Maintenance Technician in Indianapolis, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work atmosphere to work in", "cons": "Change is slow\r\nTo much overtime"}, {"review_title": "a good company to work for", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Senior Engineer in Santa Clara, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good benefit, excellent work life balance", "cons": "bureaucracy, low efficiency, lots of politics"}, {"review_title": "Well intentioned employees but senior management has trouble prioritizing", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Product Manager in Mississauga, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Co-workers are all trying their best to do what is right for patients.
