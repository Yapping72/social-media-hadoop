Managers are not concerned with the development of their people, payscales are unfair and depend entirely on what leverage you have as well as whether you\u2019re an expat. \n\nTo justify pay differences of 40-60% between locals and expats at the same level, management has been heard saying things like \u201cSingaporeans should be paid less because they don\u2019t need to cover rent\u201d. \n\nDo not let the management trick you into thinking that there will be a bonus scheme. They have said that for several years. I\u2019d be pleasantly surprised if they started offering one next year. \n\nThere are also countless employees who were never offered pay adjustments despite taking on greater responsibility. Management will wait till you are about to resign to offer a pay adjustment. Expect performance discussions to have an adversarial focus rather than a developmental focus. \n\nRecently, they have also started revising their notice period to 3 months even for junior positions to stem the wave of resignations. \n\nSome senior managers are engaging in empire-building, where they attempt to assume responsibilities from another vertical and undermine them secretly. This leads to terrible office politics which the top management(C-suite and MDs) seem oblivious to. \n\nOne last note: If you\u2019re an engineer and considering joining foodpanda APAC in 2019, the bar has been greatly lowered for new joiners as they are looking to meet the aggressive hiring targets they\u2019ve announced recently.

Does not matter you are on MC or AL, you have to fulfill your monthly target. For example, your monthly target is 700 audit to complete with 100% of the accuracy means if your audits are re-audited by the experts and if there is any variation, you will not be able to achieve 100% of your audit accuracy. completing 700 audits in a month within the time frame with 100% accuracy is not a joke. Moreover, if you are in MC (Medical leave) or on Al (Annual Leave), you are still required to reach your target. Failure to do so, your KPI/monthly performance bonus will be zero. \nThis is when you feel enslaved. There is no priority of your health condition or your mental wellness. \n\n4.

If you are lucky, you may be assigned to a team who values work life balance. Sometimes the chapter meetings are interesting and useful. Some colleagues are really knowledgeable and helpful", "cons": "Some engineering managers here are like self-help books, but in reverse. Even though there's daily standup, they may require you to join private meetings every few days and then ask you about every little detail of your work. Insecure managers feel insecure about not managing enough, thus interrupting you all the time. There's a strong obsession with KPI among managers here. For example, we have a KPI for test coverage, and before every quarterly planning we are asked to pump it up by writing trivial tests, creating a false sense of safety while trashing our code base. I remember one day my manager literally told the team not to create bug tickets if we find any, but a general ticket instead because it would affect our bug KPI otherwise. I almost laughed! One thing the managers here really enjoy is cooking reports. They\u2019re so eloquent and so good at manipulating words. They\u2019re the kind of people that would change a light bulb, and then would write that they \u201csuccessfully upgrade the illumination system with zero cost overruns and zero safety incidents\" in their quarterly reports. If you expect your manager to be your ally, you\u2019re wrong. They may occasionally help you to appear to be on your side. But when you make a mistake, or when non-tech people interrogate you with ridiculous demands, you\u2019re alone.\r\n\r\nAs an engineer, you may learn a few things here, but the diminishing returns come fast. Code reviews (CR) are not done properly. There's no coding convention, some \"senior\" engineers don't even know what to look for or how to give feedback in a CR, managers may even nag the reviewer to give it a pass for a quick release. This is extremely destructive to junior engineers as they may develop bad habits. Sometimes the manager decides that he needs to \"help\" the team move faster, so he writes some unmaintainable and/or buggy codes. Who will be in charge when there are issues? Of course, it's the engineers! I never had a meaningful CR conversation during my tenure, and my programing skill would have plateaued if I had not practiced with my own projects on weekends.\r\n\r\nThe company fosters a culture of fast delivery. Delivery is king. You want a proper solution to the new feature? No, use the fastest and most straight forward solution so that we can delivery it next week! You want to make changes to the database because the initial design cannot satisfy new requirements? No, make some workaround a.k.a. hack, so that we can ship this in 2 days! Again, this is extremely destructive to junior engineers as they might think this is the norm or industry standard. Focusing on delivery makes new projects look good to management, but the maintenance and extension after that is a nightmare. There were periods when I spent 80% of my time fixing bugs and handle production issues. But at least I learned something right? No, I did not. If I break a glass into splinters, and then ask you to clean up the mess, and I do that every day, do you learn something new from it? All those issues could have been prevented, but people don\u2019t want a resilient and stable product, they want to delivery things fast to get promoted, which brings us to the next topic.\r\n\r\nPromotion is a joke, period. There is a framework to measure your performance which appears to be sophisticated, but in fact just confusing and generic. In fact the chance of getting promoted is proportional to how much you can fill in the blank spaces in your performance review (you know why you need to deliver fast now, do you?), how good you are at playing with words (see the first paragraph), and how close you are to your manager and his peers. I witnessed an engineer who got promoted after 1 year because he was involved in a lot of projects (so he has lots of things to write in his performance report). His coding skill is still the same as it had been 1 year before. He still doesn\u2019t know the difference between a pod and a service (in the context of Kubernetes). He still produces clutters of unmaintainable and unreadable codes. Every piece of code he touches, there\u2019s a bug lying dormant. And somehow he got promoted! Don\u2019t get me wrong though, I want to have a promotion as much as anyone, but it has to be really because of my achievement. Being passionate with the product, focus on growth and improvement should be the top priority, and promotion will come as a by-product. That\u2019s what I feel about software engineer. Here I hardly felt any passion from the people I work with. Most of them are a bunch of passionless robots who just want to deliver a mediocre product and utilize their social skills to climb the corporate ladder."}, {"review_title": "Good place to start your career", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Executive in Kuala Lumpur", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working environment is fun and overall very diverse!

Like other reviews mentioned, the organisational structure is a mess & there is zero internal career development. The average tenure in the HK office is ~7 months.\r\n\r\n2. The organisation structure is weird because there is no check and balance. \r\n\r\nThe leader in Hong Kong has an Employee mindset who sheds away all management responsibilities to the \"Heads\" and he only focuses on attending external events to meet people who could potentially help with his own \"start-up\" and talking to senior management in Singapore and Berlin. \r\n\r\nThe middle management in Hong Kong, like many reviews described, is awfully inexperienced and messy. Everyone is driven by their own agenda, i.e. pleasing their bosses with the hope of getting a promotion, and there is no uniform / consolidated direction / goals for the company. The company is obsessed with quarterly OKRs but the numbers are set arbitrarily with no real business understanding.\r\n\r\nThe employee experience wouldn't have been so disastrous if the individual team leaders were capable / effective. The sad fact is that they really aren't. There isn't even ONE single leader who is anywhere near the level required for leading a company at this size (in terms of market cap / gross sales / market share dominance).\r\n\r\nIn normal companies, the HR team could have been a saviour in this situation, but unfortunately it's not the case. \r\n\r\n3. The worst problem is the lack of diversity in the management. In the HK office, all of the Directors are male, with only one of them being Asian (the CEO). Prior to the new CEO joining in Dec 2020, all of the senior management are expats who do not speak / read any Chinese. Their background significantly limits their business comprehension. A lot of times, the employees are pushed to chase unachievable goals with no real rewards. Therefore, capable employees would simply leave as there is no pull factors for staying at all. The only employees who stay beyond 1 year either have zero chance of getting a comparable comp package and/or title elsewhere (i.e. they have been parachuted to a position beyond their actual capabilities and qualifications) OR have zero career ambition.\r\n\r\n4. Advice for anyone considering joining the company, especially women: please do not waste your time here if you are looking for a place where you can find motivated colleagues, visionary and responsible leaders, work-life balance, positive culture, and career path. This company is the opposite of all these things.\r\n\r\n5. Note for those with any sense of structural fairness:  there is no structural justice in the company, with multiple internal complaints being swept under the carpet and employees being treated very unfairly.\r\n\r\n6. Last but not least, like other reviewers mentioned, the management in Singapore and the global team in Berlin share similar traits described in the examples of the HK office above. Having seen the real figures in the past 3 quarters, I really doubt if the management can pull it off to bring the business (including food delivery & other verticals) to profitability and sustainability in the next 3-5 years.\r\n\r\n7. Note: the couriers are not hired as \"employees\" at foodpanda. I wish Glassdoor would separate courier reviews from employee reviews, as well as to provide more clarity on the global-regional-local structure."}, {"review_title": "Looks fun until it's not", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible working hours\nNice merch\nCompany benefits", "cons": "Poor internal management\nVery little room for growth, learning, and development"}, {"review_title": "Shops", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Senior Key Account Manager in Kuala Lumpur", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible and big team support", "cons": "System slow affects overall performance"}, {"review_title": "A learning experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Business Executive in Kuala Lumpur", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Exposure to business and food delivery industry", "cons": "A lot of workload,but you will learn a lot"}, {"review_title": "Fast-paced environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Human Resources Assistant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Carrying the brand\n- Exposure and expansion\n- Provision of your laptops, phones, etc", "cons": "- deadlines -- hard to keep up but it's on me"}, {"review_title": "A good job for freshers", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Content Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.
