It's been promising but the progress has been slow. - Reasonably fast paced, not always in a good way though. - Many smart people (some can be complete d**ks though) who will challenge you to push yourself. - The founders have somehow managed to attract some really prolific leaders from the industry. There are 6 CXOs, I kid you not. In addition to the 3 cofounders, there's a Chief Technology Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Revenue Officer, Chief Business Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, Chief Growth Officer. not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. - Employees have access to equity through the Space Cadet and Space Explorer programs which is supposed to reward top performers. Performance, however, is a strong function of the relationships you have with those who the cofounders trust.", "cons": "There's a B2C business where Circles acts as an MVNO in Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, Indonesia and a B2B business where Circles provides cloud-based software to big telcos around the world to help them launch their digital sub-brands for underserved segments. For valid reasons, the company's focus is on getting the B2B business right & investing in and scaling it while the B2C business keeps the company afloat (for now). My comments are strictly based on my experience in the B2C business and not B2B. - Incredibly high attrition : You'll always see new job openings. Not because the MVNO business is growing but because people keep coming and going. There are many who quit within 3 months. The environment is very uncertain and unstable. Also, there's no proper handover or knowledge transfer. The result: Failed experiments or campaigns get repeated again only to fail again. - Bleak Product roadmap - As a Telco, your core product offerings are Data and Voice and how you're able to structure and package them to suit customer needs. As an MVNO, Circles neither has direct control over the core Telco tech nor is it able to influence partner telcos to bring new offerings or enter new segments. - Moving fast without executing well:There is a lot of intent to experiment and learn but the experiments are done without a clear plan or expectation about outcomes in such a hasty manner that they would just fail not due to an invalid hypothesis but due to poor execution. The result: Most of the time, it feels like everybody is doing so much work and burning out but things are going nowhere. - Lack of mentorship: Much of the above problem is because the people who do the work are interns or young professionals in their first or second job and lack proper judgment. but the root cause is lack is mentorship from seniors and leaders to coach them about what's right and what's not. - Bullies are allowed to thrive and are rewarded despite their behavior: Several people are generally nice and helpful. However, there are a few people who are just outright bullies. Their behaviour cannot be challenged as they are deemed 'passionate' due to slogging 80 hour weeks or they are the 'Old Guard' trusted a lot more by Senior Leadership. - Salary: much lower than market pay. also please forget about increments if you're not the best performer in your team. - Use of South Asian languages at work is commonplace and doesn't make the environment feel inclusive. To me, it seemed like 2 types of people could thrive in the organization - the type that worked hard to optimize for investor presentations and maximizing valuation, and the other type that worked harder to please the first type and be in their good books. Although one of the values is to give power back to customers, it's mostly just stated in meetings and slide decks, and never practiced in reality."}, {"review_title": "The Circles Life", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Presales Solutions Architect in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People-Centric, Open, Integrity, Humble, Innovative, Constructive Disruption, Creative, Efficient, Effective, Surgical, Precise, Always-On, Collaboration \r\n\r\nAt Circles, I've had one of the most smoothest, well planned onboarding journeys and was ready to go on Day 1 with zero effort.

big telcos, what Grab & Uber are to the ride hailing industry.\u00a0 They boast about their Circles-X platform and how they can solve the 20-year old problems the industry has had.\u00a0 However, as we all know, all of Circles' tech is based on Oracle (+90% of it).\u00a0 Even to the point that Circles doesn't even have a registered IP because it did not develop anything.\r\nThen there's the CSOP

fund.\u00a0 Word around is that CSOPs are worth nothing because they are not tied to equity, but also that the Founders have cashed out in the latest funding round.\u00a0 This is very frustrating.\r\nThen there's HR & Talent, which continuously keeps on walking out the door because they become frustrated or because they are tired of the politics and having to deal with the incompetency of managers and the lack of willingness of founders to listen to alternative points of view.

But, when the complete environment is shady, it's my duty as an engineer to warn others.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some factual points -\r\n\r\n1) Management - Manager's who have joined recently seem to be better than the existing lot, let's wait until they become part of this system, or leave. Old ones just benefited and became managers because of sticking with the company for a long time and don't have the people management skills, or right technical skills, or both management and technical skills\r\n2) Politics - From top to bottom it is there. It's not an engineering company but a political setup\r\n3) Pressure - You won't know the reason but there is a constant pressure\r\n4) Poisonous - The more you stay in this company, more bad it will do to you personally and professionally\r\n5) Learning - They give few \"chosen\" employees some online courses coupons, others are neglected as they are just labours. You need to be favoured by your manager for this, some genuinely hard working guys are also given this benefit, but the ratio is [1:5::good:mediocre]\r\n6) CSOPs - BIGGEST SCAM, in the last one year policy w.r.t. awarding of CSOP's was changed almost every month. It was done to deny you CSOP's in every way possible\r\n7) Exits - Many people were handed pink slips. People were fired in the worst possible way, no professionalism even when parting with your own employees. Looking at the mayhem, and the unstable environment, many good people quit themselves out of self respect, as they didn't find this company worthy enough to put their career on the line\r\n8) Marketing heavy - It's a big marketing setup where starting from founders to CTO they know how to sell subpar things at good prices and raise funding. Check the advertisements of Circles.Life in Australia and cat videos in Singapore, if these resonate to you, then please go ahead. Also, I hope you are smart enough to have figured out how there are many 5 star ratings [no brainer - added by HR team]. Look at recent exits in the HR team and you would know the situation\r\n9) Bonus and Hike - 0.5 months of bonus to most, 1 month bonus to chosen ones. No hike was given to most citing different stories, no consistency even among stories\r\n10) Space cadet and explorer - ANOTHER SCAM. If you feel hard work can help you become one, you will be disappointed. Most of the people who have got these fancy rewards won't even find a decent job in a good company outside. It's just a mechanism to retain people who have created dependency in company\r\n11) Growth - hahaha, no growth in any terms. No clear career progression roadmap defined. Every month starting last 1 year a new timeline was given about releasing career progression and role definition guide\r\n12) Hierarchy - People report to anyone and anyone can become manager/lead[literally anyone], true for more than 75%  of the lot. Look at the profile of the people with whom you are supposed to work, or to report, before you accept the offer. Also, refer to point no 1 when making the decision about joining this company\r\n13) HR - Bunch of spineless people. Worst I have experienced so far in my career, they are the ones who just want to lay policies to fire people, and don't care about how to make people grow. But, I pity them, due to the condition outside they are just doing everything asked to save their own jobs\r\n14) Employee benefits - No insurance for family, it only covers employee, no memberships, no education support, monthly phone bills can be reimbursed [here comes the surprise - you need to submit bills every month for the same, thing as simple as this in a TELCO company, where founders/CTO in one breath compares Circles to FAANG is not automated]\r\n\r\n\r\nCircles.Life company motto is to run fast and the company name has circles in it. Company name itself should give you a cue, as a circle means no direction. \r\n\r\nFill in the blank puzzle for \"Physics\" fans ?\r\nWhen you run around a circle with the speed of light you end up ...?... yourself. \r\n\r\nIf you have figured out the blank, you have already proven that you are smart. I don't need to convince you more about what to do or not to do. \r\n\r\nIf you want to work in a madhouse, like to work with people who would talk about random things which wont make any sense, want to learn big technical jargons, want to learn about how not to build a product (engineering as well as product wise), then you are lucky to have found this company.

You can find yourself easily working 18-hour shifts on weekdays. Meetings are arranged on weekends and sometimes on public holidays. If you do see any other reviews that claims that there is plenty of work-life balance here, they are probably at the top managerial level where they do all the talking and none of the heavy lifting.\r\n\r\nCLUELESS LEADERSHIP: The CEO is known to prefer yes-men over those who are opinionated but genuinely have good ideas, but the founders and senior management have little clue on how to bring the business forward. The lack of business acumen and relationship management is appalling, as the constant cherry-picking and indecisiveness have caused the company to lose out on potential growth opportunities and new revenue streams. Instead of rectifying this, the leaders have been sugarcoating the lack of growth with big words and fluffy \"motivational speeches\".\r\n\r\nCAREER REGRESSION: Earlier in 2020, the company laid off a huge number of employees due to over-hiring from the previous two quarters, but chose to blame it on the employees for being poor performers.

They do not understand that things need to be properly planned and executed. If they need something for the weekend, they will only raise last-minute on Friday evening and call you \u201cblocker\u201d if you don\u2019t work on Friday night or weekends.\r\n\r\n2) Many bad managers are around (although new managers seem to be good). Bad managers will not protect the team and they will not care about the wellness of the employees. Instead of finding out why there are so many last-minute requests (from number 1), managers will just ask the employees to work on weekends. If you do not work on weekends, they will mark you as \u201cunder-performer\u201d and just let you go. They basically treat employees as slaves and expect to work 24/7.\r\n\r\n3) During town hall in front of everyone, department head likes to say that they are building the best place to work and grow and weekends work are not expected. Yet after the town hall behind the scene, they will still ask employees to work on weekends.\r\n\r\n4) Poor work-life balance\r\n\r\n5) Performance review is very biased based on \u201cpersonality favoritism\u201d and not on actual performance. Even if your performance is decent, if you make 1 mistake, you may be asked to go. However, those people who are performing nothing will stay in the company for long.\r\n\r\n6) They do not know how to scale or plan ahead. When engineers work on issues, they only care about fixing the issues in the short-term without thinking about long-term scalability, stability, sustainability or security. Many people in tech team call themselves as tech person but they are not even familiar with those concepts. So there are many recurring issues because things were not properly done in the first place. It may not be engineers fault because they are all over-worked because of bad managers above (from number 2).\r\n\r\n7) Founders make mistakes and wrong decisions at the expense of employees, like closing down Australia and Bangalore office, laying off many people across all regions and giving less than 1-month bonus with 0 increment.\r\n\r\n8) No job security. You may be let go anytime. We cannot trust the founders. After Australia and Bangalore office closed, founders mentioned in the town hall that there would be no more laying off. Soon after that town hall, laying off in Singapore started.\r\n\r\n9) Positive reviews here are doubtful because employees are asked to write good reviews and they are asked to put themselves as \u201cShareholder\u201d on LinkedIn. \r\n\r\n10) Out of my 10 years of working experience, Circles.Life experience is the worst ever.

Individual bad-egg managers and typical tech / startup scaling pains really drag down the experience. These are real problems, and they cause real pain for some of us. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, there are still great opportunities and people around, and the company is headed in the right direction - on innovation, profit, and culture.\r\n\r\nIt really is up to you to decide if that's the tradeoff you want to make, balanced against your preferences and needs. It's a bad deal if your expectations, or what you need in your life at this time are different. But this isn't a bad company. Not by a long shot.\r\n\r\n> PROS <\r\n\r\n1. Growth trajectory. \r\nThis company's going places, quickly, with great products and serious resources (both financial as well as talent-wise, on the whole); it's quite likely to succeed in a big way. \r\n\r\nEven over beers with those who left feeling frustrated and mismanaged, on both tech and non-tech teams - they agree that on the whole the company is doing good business, and that this is a good brand to have on your CV.\r\n\r\n2. Opportunity.\r\nCL is growing crazy fast, so it's really like what they say about fast-growing companies and exposure. You can expect to work on international projects affecting millions of users or high level strategy across the organisation globally quite quickly in some cases.\r\n\r\nPlus, this is a really good/critical time to join the company just before it goes full steam on global expansion - so you do get to do important & high profile things much earlier than you would elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAgain, great for your CV and personal growth.\r\n\r\n3. Talent.\r\nBad eggs are a given, and maybe it's true we can do a better job of weeding them out - but by and large, plenty of smart people around on average. Add this to point 2 and it means you really do get the chance to learn lots from doing big things with smart people", "cons": "> CONS < \r\n\r\n1. Work-life balance.\r\nThink the right policies are in place...we have a work from home policy now, and broadly managers are flexible. Ultimately though it boils down to your individual manager, and business needs. Not every manager respects your off-time (nights, weekends) or is understanding to your needs - so, in other words, just like anywhere else.\r\n\r\nWhere it gets really frustrating is when you feel like you're staying back for a poor reason. Which leads to:\r\n\r\n2. Inefficiency.\r\nThe telco tech here is really advanced, which is why it's strange that things are just done...badly sometimes. Like having a lot of different Google Sheets to manage simple things. Horribly documented legacy code. Just bad, dirty data that creates problems for everybody. \r\n\r\nLots of people across every team are concerned more with doing things quickly in the moment, than doing things right in a way that saves time and irritation down the road.\r\n\r\nIt's a total mess sometimes and a serious pain point. If I left, this would be why. Again, a bit of a 'necessary evil'...know for a fact that Grab, honestbee, and more are suffering the exact same problem.\r\n\r\n3. Culture.\r\nValues aren't really lived because we don't properly hire for culture like other places do, we're not confrontational enough to call out bad culture when it happens, and culture initiatives are half-hearted in execution or not targeted in the right way. (example: we have a foosball table. but you'll never see senior leaders using it...)\r\n\r\nCulture is hard to do right and happens from the ground. Some stuff is in progress but right now this is just lacking. What this problem looks like is exactly what others have mentioned: micromanagement, politics, taichi, just a lack of enthusiasm, not speaking out when something's being done wrong, even by senior leaders. (Good counterexample to this is what Facebook has on \"see something, fix something\")\r\n\r\n> OTHERS < \r\n\r\nSeeing lots of comments saying positive reviews are planted. I don't know if this was ever true, but it's quite definitely not true now. I think we'd have done a better job of adding more positive reviews if that was the case; a 3+ rating isn't great.\r\n\r\nOverall, serious problems we need to deal with. There is still a long way to go, but there have been signs for a while that management is pivoting seriously to fix this, especially before we launch in multiple countries.\r\n\r\nStill, it just means you need to decide to work here with your eyes open and a clear mind on what you want and are willing to give up.\r\n\r\nTo put things in perspective, you'll hear the same problems and pluses if you ask anyone working at a tech company at this early stage of development. \r\n\r\nIt's the same tradeoff, and if those who compare Circles right now to cushy jobs in other more 'developed' tech firms (like Grab lol, fun favourite benchmark) isn't being fair. You need to compare Circles now to Grab then, not Grab as it is today: the tradeoff and the value proposition is now very different."}, {"review_title": "How to not enjoy your career", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Apr 2020", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Fake camaraderie events, \r\n- Fake town halls, reports\r\n- Fake media releases", "cons": "- You learn to be fake and dishonest, looking almost passionate in your work when your self belief tells you that its actually a poor quality product we are releasing\r\n- The talk is all about inspirational leaders, sacrificial leadership when truth is one of bureaucracy\r\n- You learn you are never enough and you are not worth it, which leads to poor self belief and confidence\r\n- You learn to write fake reviews, provide false promises and releases\r\n- You go to work never happy and never safe which results in an unproductive career span\r\n- There is a library of how to make a workplace great and yet it is one of the worse places to spend time at\r\n- Work by instructions not by trust and inspiration\r\n- Majority are in for the ride not for the journey"}], [{"review_title": "Solid community, good future potential", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-great employee program Space Explorers\r\n-stock options are generous\r\n-free flow snacks and weekly company lunches\r\n-team outings\r\n-insurance and medical benefits", "cons": "-no dental benefits\r\n-not enough leave days\r\n-work from home not flexible\r\n-founders and leaders like to micromanage, not sure if they're aware\r\n-more empowerment needed"}, {"review_title": "Excellent working environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Jul 2018", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work life balance.

The evidence of this was the demolition of the ideathon practice where they encouraged employees to contribute new ideas for new relevant products or verticals.\r\n\r\nKey unresolved issues within the top management.\r\nA) The '3-cofounder' model is clearly a tactic to absolve themselves from mistakes and responsibility. They refuse to nominate 1 CEO. Each co-founder supposedly has a clear portfolio to manage, but in reality, they overlap, thus small issues can take months to resolve due to disagreement among themselves. If you're looking for a company with strong leadership, give this one a pass.\r\nB) They are clearly inexperienced handling a company of this size and stage. Even the CTO seems to be better equipped in handling the direction of the company. Hold on, why is there a CTO if there are no C-suites?\r\n\r\nDishonesty is the core of this company.\r\ni) For all the talk about bonuses and stock options, they never kept their promises. Terms in the contract are intentionally made vague (it's technically legal, so there's no case to bring to court). If you've been offered a role, please question the HR hard because you can be sure they can't give specifics.\r\nii) Their transparency is a farce as important communications to employees keep dwindling. They also don't address legitimate issues that have been raised in meetings and townhalls. The values and mission they keep selling are never seen in the 3 co-founders, so don't expect anyone else to exhibit them!\r\niii) You'll be surprised to find out that there's no fixed date for payroll as well.

Amazing company LinkedIn profile that makes Circles look glorious on the outside. \r\nTelco bill reimbursement, group medical insurance.", "cons": "Too many to list down. but here are a few. Things started going downhill since last year. Glassdoor rating was as high as 3.7 just a year ago, but now a pathetic 2.4 and this is NOT for no reason. \r\n\r\n- Multiple \u201crestructurings\u201d happened and people got laid off since last October. Used to joke that Thanos appeared in Circles because every few weeks there were layoffs, but it has since evolved into a fear culture that these jokes aren\u2019t even funny anymore. We were tricked into believing every single lay-off was \u201cthe last one\u201d in the company\u2019s exact words. And then it happened, and happened, and happened again and again.\r\n\r\n- High turnover rate. Most good people are leaving the company because of the turn of events that have happened. Many are looking for an exit. Ask around, even recruiters from other companies know about it, we were told during interviews with other companies.\r\n\r\n- Don\u2019t trust anything the recruiters tell you if it is not written in your offer letter. Don\u2019t be naive. Make sure everything is in the OFFER LETTER that you sign and not only in the email, or worse still if it\u2019s just verbally told to you. When questioned why salary adjustment was promised by recruiters but not granted, the company\u2019s response was \u201cwe did not commit to that if you check your offer letter\u201d.  Wow, amazing. You won the legal game. \r\nMany people even for those who have worked for >1 year did not enjoy any salary adjustments last year, and for those who got it, it was way lower than market rate. Do you want your pay to be stuck at the same range even after working for a few years? Think twice because when you move on to other jobs, companies will base their offer on your current pay, which means you are kinda stuck. \r\n\r\n- Management here abuses the word \u201cownership\u201d. Taking ownership means you are expected to firefight, churn and deliver within tight timelines and most of the time losing your work-life balance. The CEO said firefighting is in our company spirits. What? \r\n\r\n- Process changes all the time without elaborate planning and systematic execution. You are told to follow this process today, two-three weeks later they would change their mind and tell you to follow another process, and the cycle keeps repeating. You will find yourself being caught up with processes instead of focusing on learning and developing your skills in the company. \r\n\r\n- Insanely KPI-driven. If setting exceptional goals to appease your boss and working overtime to meet KPIs is how you enjoy working, welcome to Circus. Oops I meant circles. \r\n\r\nTo people who are considering to take up job offers from Circles, if you do not want to constantly worry about job security, fearing that you will be fired anytime after seeing your colleagues being let go one after another, being stuck in an infinite loop of working like a robot to deliver within tight timelines but learning nothing, no pay increment, DON\u2019T JOIN. You have been warned. \r\n\r\nFresh grads especially, please look elsewhere. You deserve better. Don\u2019t be tricked by the glorious social presence of the company. Always try to speak to engineers (engineers on the ground, not managers, not recruiters) in the company first before joining one, and for circles specifically, you will understand why there are so many negative reviews on Glassdoor."}, {"review_title": "Wouldn't recommend this as a place to work", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "30 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is no doubt a very ambitious company. They truly focus on- and deliver what customers need. Management is also very performance-focused, but maybe too much (more on that later), there are some very smart and hardworking people in the company.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my experience working here had more cons than it did pros.", "cons": "Lacking transparency - They claim to have transparency in the form of sharing business results/performance goals/roadmaps, but many important business decisions are still made behind closed doors. You hear of/see new \"business partners/consultants etc\" joining the current team with no proper introductions made, and Management only addresses these when people start asking questions/express unhappiness. Reactive, not proactive. \r\n\r\nFeedback - Don't know if they still do it now but the co-Founders held \"open door sessions\" and encouraged employees to come in and give honest feedback. Pure lip service. They listen to reply, not to understand; most of the time are very defensive, making excuses, and not committing to change things at all. This behaviour was also present in the HR leadership then.\r\n\r\nPoor management culture - You'll see many other reviews here talking about their miserable management culture. (Applies to majority of Managers, not all) Extremely focused on results, yet they don't celebrate how we get there. Minimal appreciation for team members; once you reach your goal/target, another is put in front of you for immediate action. This is not wrong at all, but without proper and SINCERE appreciation shown, it's bad for employee motivation. Micromanagement is experienced by MANY teams, which trickles from the co-founders themselves. They also seem to think monetary rewards = employee motivation, which brings me to my next point..\r\n\r\nInadequate HR leaders - The leader(s) in the HR team (or as they call it internally : \"People & Culture\") need to seriously rethink their understanding of employee motivation and building a positive workplace culture. High level of unhappiness and turnover, overall workplace culture is not ideal, some senior employees bully the junior folks, yet HR doesn't do anything when these are reported. Also, I can say for a fact that most of the positive reviews here are indeed \"planted\", and were arranged by HR themselves. There are people hired into the company because of connections with Founders, without any formal selection process, and HR just goes ahead with no (or minimal) objections. I do wanna point out that this team has grown considerably large and pulled in a few new talents in lead positions. Hopefully this is for the better...\r\n\r\nAs mentioned by a few others here, this place has a disproportionate focus on growth/profit, over employees. Understandable in a high-growth startup, but that doesn't mean you ignore employee morale and feedback. Turnover is not an issue to management, they have the mindset that people are very easily replaceable. \r\n\r\nI mentioned before that this is an ambitious company, but it borders a lot of times on being arrogant/obnoxious. Management consistently boasts about how the company is \"more than a telco\", and puts themselves in the ranks of Grab, Gojek (in terms of their success in Indonesia) but honestly they haven't really developed that much as anything more than just a telco. And with this same arrogance, they assume people are dying to join the company, but at the same time not offering competitive packages at all. Office location is also simply not attractive, but again, Management sees this as a non-issue in attracting talent. They really need a serious reality check. (If you've seen their latest Marketing stunt on the papers in Apr 2019, dissing their competitors in such an unprofessional way, you'll know exactly what I mean when I say they're obnoxious)\r\n\r\nOverall, from a consumer POV, Circles.Life is a top contender. But it's not a good place to work.....unless you don't mind being worked like a slave, under Managers who just see you as a money-making mule, ready to replace you at any time."}, {"review_title": "5 stars company?
