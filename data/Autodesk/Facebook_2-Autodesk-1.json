Bias training is great and highly necessary, but if the people who have a seat at the table to make merit and promotion decisions don't put that training into action, who's going to hold them accountable? A lot of these decisions are made without a person of color having a seat at that table and it's very obvious when you look across the organization and don't see any diversity at the top.

When the company survey shows that employee satisfaction on his team is way below average quarter over quarter for multiple years, instead of figuring out a way to address and fix the issue himself, he outsources to lower level employees on his team to create, lead, and implement solutions that, surprise surprise, never result in anything.

I've had the statement \"well, three CEOs ago...\" said to me an embarrassing number of times by people wanting to block an idea or tell me why it won't work.\r\n\r\nEveryone wants to build something cool with no regard to its usefulness or need. This again undercuts trust. There are numerous internal products and services that are well-engineered and don't do anything you want them to. Since adoption is understandably low for these things groups, resort to executive-level dictates that XYZ must be used, further detaching them to build something people want as it now required anyways.\r\n\r\nThe company is 5-10 years behind the curve in terms of the Cloud. It's pretty normal to see a 10 page White Paper published internally explaining or pushing for technology or pattern that has been industry standard for years already. Workloads were lift-and-shifted to AWS, and some account reps likely got to buy personal islands with how much we spent doing it.\r\n\r\nAutodesk's growth strategy is via acquisitions (this is not bad in and of itself). Somehow they don't have a playbook on how to integrate them still (there have been over 70 as of this writing). This leads orgs to be fragmented as the tech stacks, platforms, tools, and processes of those individual companies continue to exist for years after the buy. The plethora of systems means confusion, poor standardization, and lots of poorly maintained solutions for teams.\r\n\r\nI had a coach (provided by Autodesk) tell me that many of his Autodesk clients hold out until there is a reorg if they are unhappy. Groups are reorganized frequently enough that it usually only takes a few months. There are a ton of people coasting here. Putting in minimal effort, knowing there is no pressure to deliver. Coming from a startup, it's like progress hitting a wall.\r\n\r\nThe Security and Compliance groups have created poor cultures throughout the company. The reasons are too long to list here. TL;DR they are policing units that take no efforts in improving security products to their specific needs. Everything is a generic check box that often conflicts or has a considerable gray area when viewed through a specific product lens. They have no authority for punishment and chose not to build tooling that features teams want or need.

Even as the company has been forced into increasingly competitive markets, their cash and channel have enabled them to thrive as an acquisition machine.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of chaotic, frenetic activity that occasionally results in bona fide internal innovation within the product engineering teams. If you are young and just starting your career in software engineering or related disciplines such as product management, product marketing, etc., then Autodesk is a wonderful training ground. And, you'll be handsomely paid while learning.\r\n\r\nAutodesk often ranks near the top of, \"Best Place to Work\" type of surveys. This is mainly because it suffers from what Marissa found at Yahoo: a culture of exploiting \"work life balance\" to the extreme. If you don't mind a work environment where people regularly work 5 hour days and \"work from home\" whenever they feel like it, then this is the place for you. You can also always find a seat in the supposedly overcrowded 1-Market (SF) location, which is some of the most beautiful corporate real estate you'll ever experience.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you're pursuing a future as a manager/leader, then Autodesk will give you an intense training in the toughest variant of politics:  the politics of passive-aggressive consensus. While most quality leaders tend to avoid or flee this sort of environment, clearly some folks thrive within it. If you can rationalize this within your own value system, then climbing the management ladder in Autodesk will teach you how to equivocate like a pro.", "cons": "Autodesk's overall culture can best be described as passive-aggressive, conflict-averse, and consensus-driven. Read through the reviews you'll find here or elsewhere and you'll see this theme over and over again. Talk to someone at a senior manager level or higher, and they'll confirm it (unless they're someone who loves that sort of thing; they're usually blind to it). Everywhere has politics, of course. But Autodesk's culture significantly amplifies the internal politics to many times greater than they should be for a company of this size. Example: making a decision which might take 3-5 meetings over the period of 2-3 weeks in even a much larger, more complex company can easily take (no kidding) 15-20 meeting over a period of 6+ months. And even then, the decision or agreement is at least 50% likely to be reneged upon by some passive-aggressive manager who had no intention of cooperating, resulting in a reset of the entire decision process.\r\n\r\nThe politics are most intense within the corporate GnA functions, most notoriously corporate finance and IT. Deep in the recesses of the back of the back office, the politics amongst the heavily bloated middle management and their executives truly defines realpolitik. Coercion, threats, dishonesty, doublespeak, intimidation and deception wrapped in euphemisms and culture programs are the norm. \r\n\r\nThe bottom line is there are a ton of massively overpaid directors who enjoy working 20-25 hour work weeks, living in Marin, and never having to miss one of their kids' midday sports. They've managed to carve out their little feudal fiefdoms, and if you find yourself in any sort of situation which requires their cooperation--or worse their agreement to change anything--then prepare to defend yourself from an onslaught of smarmy politics. While I could provide examples, I'm pretty sure they would come off as exaggerations or hyperbole. All I can say is, Autodesk is a place where the unimaginable happens every day:  especially within the realm of politics.  \r\n\r\nLastly, Autodesk is a place people intentionally try to go to to retire. It is a lifestyle company. Many people don't go there to work hard, they go there for generous benefits, flexible work schedules and generally not to have to think too much. The company has an abnormally high tenure. There are lots of 15-20, even 25+ year lifers who enjoy \"untouchable\" status which they happily exploit. If you're a manager, you'll end up with at least a few of these folks on your team. All I can say is, good luck. Many of these folks literally have zero experience anywhere else but Autodesk, and they will not even recognize skills, experience or ideas you may have brought in from elsewhere as valid, let alone sometimes better. \r\n\r\nThis matters because Autodesk has an incredibly effective \"tissue rejection\" culture. You can be there for years, be very successful, and still end up crossing paths with an untouchable lifer and find yourself on the fast track out."}, {"review_title": "Ok, but micromanaged", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Dec 2015", "job_title": "Territory Sales Executive in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great offices, the SF offices are amazing work spaces.

A lot of the folks here have been here forever (10+ years) and are rooted in dated processes, unwilling to take feedback from new employees, until the new employees either quit or stay long enough to get absorbed in all those dated processes. As a younger employee, this can be intimidating - an older employee, who I introduced myself to in the kitchen one day, offhandedly told me that I probably wouldn't make it to the 4-year mark, as \"millenials are noncommittal\". \r\n\r\nAs a designer, the work depends (understandably) on what team you're on- but being a part of a big company, you will be siloed, and a lot of the work won't be sexy visually. There's currently been a movement towards creating global UI guidelines but it's taken a very, very long time to develop and the team that is working on it hasn't permeated all of the design teams yet, it feels that any one team within the company doesn't have much reach across orgs. \r\n\r\nGenerally not a huge design culture here - we host a lot of design events for the public, but internally, design thinking is still relatively new to non-designers and pushing that has been a challenge. The designers feel very disconnected, and there's often duplicate efforts happening and not a lot of communication. There have been efforts to bring us together; we have designer all-hands, but it feels that the original gusto has worn off. The company is very numbers and sales driven, and at times so ambitiously so that it costs our reputation with our customers; often I've felt the way we sell and bundle our products undermines our customer experience. \r\n\r\nSome teams do not value or put as much budget into research, or sometimes that research will be introduced too late in the pipeline for any significant design changes to be made before getting rushed into development. \r\n\r\nThe people here are very transactional and often look for their own interests. When I was interviewing here, I emailed a designer on another team to ask about her interview process and her take on the culture- only to get back a reply that I should \"consider what I could offer her in return\" for her giving this information and that I should \"think about what I'm asking for before emailing her\" and that she was \"tired of getting emails asking for favors without any returns\". That should have been a red flag as this was very indicative of the silo culture here- asking for any help from any team that isn't yours will warrant a cold response, if any at all- and often to get any help you need to pull favors.

However, it\u2019s really sad to see that the greatness of the company is very far off in the Barcelona office. It\u2019s like two different worlds/companies. \r\n\r\nManagement (hub based): All managers in the hub are very unexperienced. This means that nobody has a clue what is going on. Most of them are hired externally, because only the favorites get promoted. They have no clue how to manage people. The fact they were average or good in their previous sales position, does not mean they are capable of managing people. When they become managers (mid-management/team managers), they don't have much imput nor have the ability to make their own decision. These are made one level up (senior management). Team managers have to ask for permission to the senior managent for basically everything. \r\n\r\nTeam lead program: Every year you have the chance to apply for a team lead program (trains you to become a manager), but they already decided who\u2019s going to get a spot before people can even apply. Then they don\u2019t even bother to communicate to people that they didn\u2019t get the spot. Also, some people don\u2019t even have to apply and get a spot (there\u2019s like 6 spots and 500 employees) anyways. \r\n\r\nCall center KPI\u2019s: \u2018\u2019We are not a callcenter\u2019\u2019 is what they love to tell themselves. However, since mid 2018, we have all the call center metrics and talk time is more important than your actual achievement or how productive you are. Calling a reseller for 1 hour and talk about the weather? Great, 1H TT done. Bringing in loads of business but no 1h TT? Not good enough, you\u2019ll receive an email with name shaming the people who didn\u2019t do 1H. \r\n\r\nMicro-management: the inside sales department consists of severe micro-management. Working from home (even for a good reason), no option. Emails about talk time every day, name shaming. No flexibility. They look over your shoulder all day, for some of them, its quite literally (as in: check what you\u2019re doing on your screen, listening into your calls without informing you). It\u2019s like kindergarden and they don\u2019t trust any of us. \r\n\r\nPolitics: Favouratism is the best way to describe hub-based management. If you\u2019re liked, you\u2019ll get far, if not, forget about your career at Autodesk. Want to have a career here? Make sure to play your political cards very right. \r\n\r\nSpeaking up: Something they love to \u2018\u2019encourage\u2019\u2019. But when you do, you\u2019re out. So basically you cannot say anything otherwise you will pay a very big price. They'll find a way for you to say yes and amen or you'll get fired.  \r\n\r\nPerception: Perception is also very very important here combined with favouratism. They don\u2019t care about how you really are, they\u2019ll form an opinion about you and will base everything on this. \u2018\u2019Perceived\u2019\u2019 as arrogant? No salary increase. \r\n\r\nFaking achievements: There are many favorites who\u2019s continuously faked their results. Then they get awarded for this by hub management. Even get awards. Real talent doesn\u2019t get rewarded. Neither in salary nor awards. During my time here I've seen many big talents leave because  of this, which is a big shame. \r\n\r\nCareer growth: During onboarding and interviews they say you can advance your career within ADSK. Not true. Only if you\u2019re liked and favoured. There have been several occasions senior hub management has blocked people from moving to different positions for no reason. If you\u2019re looking to grow your career, ADSK is not the place to be.  Many good people have left despite various calls to action, as they were stuck. It\u2019s only the favourites who get lucky. There is no career plan like in every other big IT company. \r\n\r\nRetention: Last year many people got fired, some without even knowing they got fired and mostly without valid reason. They will receive a nice severance package as the company has no valid ground to fire people for no reason on the spot.  If they don\u2019t get fired, they leave. Mostly the good people that are just lacking the favouratism.  These are mostly top performers who\u2019ve been waiting for 3 years to get somewhere and don\u2019t get anywhere, so they have no choice but leave and earn double somewhere else. \r\n\r\nBonus/target/quota: Quotas are not rolled out until the middle of the year. This means that TSR\u2019s only get paid 50% of the variable salary before the quota has been rolled out. HR tends to forget to tell new hires so they come in thinking they're earning more than they acutally are. For the other roles: target changed every month (and therefore they earn way less money than the target they signed for), no stability, capped at 200% etc. \r\n\r\nSalary: Used to be quite high and nice for Barcelona (TSR position), still quite low for SaaS companies. But recently they have gone down drastically. SDR's and BDR's are severely underpaid (similar to outsourcing companies). Big differences between TSR's. This is not based and aligned on being junior/medior/senior, but by how much they want to offer. This causes loads of problems between colleagues, as one colleague could earn 10K more for the same job, without having more exprience etc. You're not allowed to talk about salaries, you'll get in big trouble (because it's not fair).\r\n\r\nSalary increase: Doesn\u2019t really happen. Only once per year IF you are one of the lucky ones (read: favourites). They will use everything against you (how you\u2019re ''perceived'' rather than your achievements). If you want to change roles you\u2019d better quit and get re-hired otherwise you get a lower salary as they use an excuse they can only give you 2% more due to your old salary, even if you\u2019re changing to a different department where the salary is much higher. HR will also rather not hire people internally with a lower salary because they don\u2019t want to increase much.  There is no annual increase/inflation increase. People that do get a promotion get at least 10K less than externals getting the job (even if they don\u2019t have more experience). \r\n\r\nHR: Totally not trustworthy. They talk about confidential things of employees to colleagues or managers who shouldn\u2019t be involved, causing the employee problems with both colleagues as well as management. Even when confidentiallity has been signed by both HR and employee. Nobody feels they can trust them as there have been various incidents where this happened. They are also best friends with senior management, so best not to include HR into youre confidential problems, especially when it considers a manager. Also, they don\u2019t inform current employees about vacancies and head of recruitment doesn\u2019t want to push internals to get a job or even help them look for a suitable change, as they rather hire externals. \r\n\r\nDiversity: great that ADSK is so focused on this. However, in the hub in BCN, it seems there is more possitive discrimination than that it's benefiting the hub. Promote the best person, not because it's a woman."}, {"review_title": "Good Luck", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free Lunch, Nice offices, not much else to say here.", "cons": "Beauracratic and political.

Employee disbursements look like a bell curve. C Level is pretty standard for any corporation, Once you start going down the ladder into middle management it swells like a balloon. Leave middle management and go on down the chain and it tapers back off. Any given person may have to answer to a number of people, and most of them contradict each other. All hands meetings are mostly spent focusing on one subject that only appeals to a small segment of the audience. Any news delivered can't be 100% trusted because by the time the next one comes around the process will have changed 10 times. Middle management \"interprets\" what they take out of those meetings and regurgitates it in a completely unrecognizable form. Always being told that the division is making money on a scale never seen before yet expenditures at levels below middle management are so tightly restricted that you can't effectively do what you need to. \r\n\r\nBenefits and perks that are advertised heavily on the \"look at why we're so great to work for!\" employment site are either limited to specific office locations or left up to direct manager discretion. If you get stuck with a manager who is afraid to spend any budget on his or her direct reports then you can forget any extras.\r\n\r\nWork/Life balance is a mixed bag. It's easy to land on either side of this. Some people really manage that life part very well, while others can easily fall into the work part by saying yes one too many times. While employees aren't told that they live to work, the idea is implied.

Also, they have made a culture of hiring from the outside so it's difficult to make a lateral movement anyway or create your own opportunity.

The result is a large pool of talented individual contributors that are mostly not able or allowed to do their best work.\r\n\r\nIn the last 3 years, during the economic crisis, both layoffs and internal austerity measures where extensive, while - during the same period - additional layers of management structure were added.

Similarly, if there is an opportunity for an internal job opening where you can meet about 80% of the requirements, but you are two grade levels below the req., you cannot apply for that role.
