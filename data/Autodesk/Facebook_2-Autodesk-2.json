It would be far better to shrink/grow with contractors rather than impact FTE's consistently.  And HR - non existent!

Autodesk has a tight hiring freeze now, and probably won't even be hiring to balance attrition until 2010.\r\n\r\nAs with many large companies: there are significant internecine skirmishes that diminish energy, productivity, and alignment; the cumbersome hierarchical structure has created strata where communication gets \"stuck\" at different levels, and middle and upper management is starting to lose crucial information; management of the different groups varies significantly -- as does the overall respect with which people in different divisions are treated. If you are working in a weaker or less respectful division, the current lockdown on hiring makes it impossible to change your circumstance, and the poison drips all the way down to every level. In general, senior staff (reporting to Carl Bass) not nearly as competent as he is.\r\n\r\nFor a technical person, there are some negatives at Autodesk. Management often seems more interested in checking off the required tasks from their well-structured to do lists than in genuinely thinking out the best or smartest way to achieve something. There is not a career path for senior technical staff who are uninterested in management. There is a significant amount of work allocated to employees in China and India, while European offices are being scaled back or closed. \r\n\r\nLayoffs are global (on par with software companies of this size). The current practice (again, somewhat common in large companies) of mandating exactly when employees must take vacation (in order to clear AR from the books for accounting purposes) is antithetical to the very idea of what vacations are for. This combined with no change in expectations or deadlines to adjust for staffing cutbacks means that the current staff will be working much harder for the next year or two. Since life/work balance was not good to start with, some long hours are ahead.\r\n\r\nHighly creative people may not fare well at Autodesk. Individual thinking or acting in a way that is different than standard is something that happens in spite of, not because of corporate encouragement. Legacy software -- particularly AutoCAD -- and legacy thinking create a serious drag on novel approaches, so product innovation is achieved principally through acquisition, rather than through \"from within\" efforts. Autodesk can then slowly but systemically crush the processes and culture of the acquired companies that generated the innovations they wanted to buy in the first place. Often the smartest and most passionate people from the new companies have the worst fit with the existing hierarchy -- or worse yet, are seen as threats to already-established personnel. If you are used to working in a flatter, faster, and more creative environment, being assimilated into the structure of a huge, multi-national corporation -- even a well-run one, as Autodesk is -- can be just as unpleasant as you might guess."}, {"review_title": "can be a good company if you have good managers", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible work time\r\nwork from home", "cons": "heavy workload\r\nrecognition - somehow strict to give senior title, many employees with years of experience don't have senior title\r\nglobal work space creates political environment and employees get affected by the war among regional offices\r\nannual vacation days - only 2 weeks for any level"}], [{"review_title": "An Awesome company, but an ageing workforce brings momentum challenges", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "29 Apr 2012", "job_title": "R&D", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-One of a kind company that you can be very proud to be a part of \r\n-Personally, I liked the CEO and the SVP - very passionate people\r\n-Excellent benefits (the ESPP plan is pretty awesome that most employees made a fortune on)\r\n-The vacation policy and sabbatical are awesome, especially considering that the company observes almost 15 holidays with a December week of rest.\r\n(Some who complain about pay and benefits have no clue on what the outside world looks like)\r\n-You will experience what working in a global & diverse environment is - great learning\r\n-Up until about 2008, it was a fairly flat org with very competent senior management and great focus on making a smaller set of products as wining products (drifted since).
