The most confusing thing is that this department reports up to human resources. This doesn't give the rest of us much hope that anything will be done if similar concerns are raised.

He\u2019s out-of-touch with the leadership of his organization, the sales force and customers.  It\u2019s concerning and has dramatically impacted morale across the organization as reflected within the internal employee feedback which is collected bi-annually.  Despite that collected feedback, nothing is ever addressed nor any actions taken to improve upon the feedback provided.  \r\n\r\nSales organization is treated as dispensable and replaceable.  The churn has been dramatic and nothing has been said nor have there been any gestures towards retention of employees while other industry leading tech companies have announced very public and specific plans to invest in employee retention. \r\n\r\nFinancial measurements of the company change constantly and are typically mis-aligned to conducting business with our enterprise customers. The unrealistic growth targets leave dramatic gaps requiring last minute shifts which put customer facing sellers in compromised positions, jeopardizing trust with their customers.  \r\n\r\nOver-burdened with out-of-touch and disconnected processes as well as elementary (and largely worthless) sales trainings that provide no relevance to senior level sales professionals.   Requiring senior level and highly accomplished sales professionals to sit on weekly 1-2 hour Zoom calls with a sales trainer that has never actually been in sales, demonstrates the disconnect. This demonstrates the CRO\u2019s lack of understanding of the skills that exist and how to guide the sales enablement accordingly.\r\n\r\nPerception is senior level sales professionals are not valued and are replaceable with younger, cheaper, and far from qualified new hires.  As an example, a sales team has experienced significant turnover with new, and in many cases, first-time sales professionals.  That is the new trend.  Senior sales professionals considering a position in the enterprise sales organization, take caution and ask the right questions in your interview process. \r\n\r\nRecently  \u2018appointed\u2019 vice presidents are immature in their leadership.  Understandably, they are not interested in challenging the leadership above them nor being challenged themselves.  \r\n\r\nDespite outrageous growth expectations (50+% annually) bestowed upon the sales organizations, there has been zero investment in new personnel in key positions to support the growth expectations.  In many cases, support staff is just shuffled around and, in certain cases, applied elsewhere into non-essential roles.  \r\n\r\nMerit increases are below inflation and cost-of-living levels.  They\u2019re largely insulting.  Sales leaders will tell you you\u2019re a high performer and couple that with a 2-3% compensation increase and minimal levels of RSUs.  The growth targets assigned each year significantly negate any increase in compensation and in my case, decreases compensation year after year.  This lead to my departure, as well as others, to adjacent tech companies who are public with their retention plans as well as highly incentivizing their sales professionals.  Autodesk is doing neither.  \r\n\r\nDecision making is over engineered and even sales leaders cannot make simple decisions relative to their business without layers of approvals and \u2018sign-off\u2019 above and around them. \r\n\r\nHR professionals are out-of-touch and have become more psycho-analytical vs. relatable and impactful.  They are only aligned at the most senior levels of the organization, not with the most essential part of any organization, the people.

There\u2019s some really great mentors and people you can learn from.", "cons": "There\u2019s been a period of significant slowdown. At least in part due to the pandemic but it seems the culture has shifted even though it\u2019s approaching nearly a year since the last shutdown. I think a lot of projects lost momentum and people started to question their purpose and belonging which led to a shift in the way research is being undertaken, fewer but larger projects rather than many smaller ones (although oddly it seems like we are still doing many disconnected small projects just under the umbrella of a larger one). This process has taken so long to bring in, half of research has been unable to do anything for about 6 months.\n\nThere\u2019s been a high turnover of staff recently. The market is very strong even now despite the downturn in the tech stock market. Autodesk is struggling a bit to compete on salaries but that isn\u2019t always the things that drive us, importantly the work that we do has been paused for a long time people left so they could actually do something. A lot of the recent departures were waiting to see what the new changes to research were and clearly they didn\u2019t like it. From the teams I work with there\u2019s been a 20-50% departure rate recently. This does hurt moral somewhat. \n\nIn the past the way we approached work was very simple. Find a customer problem or develop our own and then develop a solution to it. The new way is very slow, layered with process and far from simple. This could wear people down if it\u2019s not done right. \n\nThe company has a flexible approach to work but this is perhaps a little too flexible. I think they are suffering a bit with \u201cquiet quitting\u201d. Work from home whilst working well for many is potentially being spoilt by a few.

Product divisions don't understand the infrastructure that runs the company, and are the worst communicators I've ever seen in terms of sharing their product plans with the upstream and downstream groups who will bear the workload of their decisions.  The customer experience is complex, and end customers frequently become frustrated but the experience of simply accessing and managing their software investments.  The company has a habit of doing 3X yearly employee surveys but does not always honestly assess what employees are telling them, and it feels like Autodesk will put more effort into 'spinning' the survey results than addressing the raised issues.  H.R. support is weak after a recently departed H.R. V.P. gutted the department and tried to turn it into a ticket-driven, self service support function and I doubt those folks have time to breathe.  Still, every company has challenges and Autodesk's heart is in the right place.  We're on a journey to be better, and that's made tougher by the span and rate of change, as well as the rapid growth of recent years - but things are trending up."}, {"review_title": "Senior Software Engineer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "work life balance and overall satisfied compensation.", "cons": "redundant construction and few level up opportunity."}, {"review_title": "Progressive, but still suffers from legacy organizational baggage.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Program Manager, Governance in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Espouses progressive employee-centered wellness as a core company culture standard\r\n-Average/decent pay\r\n-Flexible time off (keep in mind this is so they don\u2019t have to pay out vacation days, make sure you push for time off!)\r\n-In the sea of tech companies with terrible company cultures and questionable ethics, Autodesk is at least on the other end of the spectrum.

Despite this, management in the Birmingham office seem very keen to push us towards a return to the office early next year. Autodesk has introduced a global company-wide \"workplace flexibility\" programme which allows most employees to change their working pattern to hybrid-remote, under hybrid-remote there is no minimum requirement to be in the office other than specific instances which your managment chain deem to be useful for team collaboration. Organisations have adopted this in varying ways. In the Birmingham office this has been made clear to mean \"2-3 days a week in the office\". This is an issue as in a recent employee survey it came out that over half of employees in my organisation wish to be in the office no more than 1 day a week. Despite this, managment are taking a hard stance on this, rejecting flexible working applications from people who have re-located in the last 18 months and increasingly trying to push the idea of returning to the office on the rest of us. A lot of employees here are currently waiting in hope that managment will eventually cave in and allow more flexibility, otherwise people will be left with no choice but to leave the company for a role that is more remote friendly. If this happens the company will surely struggle to hire experienced engineers to fill the vacancies, there has already been an ongoing problem with hiring experienced engineers for roles here and this will only get worse if we're forced to go into the office so often. \nThe office itself is also in an undesireable location, if the office was in the city centre rather than an industrial park in Small Heath people might feel differently about returning. I would very much advise any prospective employee to check out the surrounding location to the office if they don't get an opportunity to see it during the hiring process.\nPay could be better,
