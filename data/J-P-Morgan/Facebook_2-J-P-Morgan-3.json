It's a roll of the dice. Some people have had a negative experience with their managers or the team that they're on. Personally, I like my team, the department I work in, and I enjoy my managers. \r\n- Flexible schedule. 5% 401K match. Good benefits. Good work life balance. Affordable insurance plans. Tuition reimbursement. Business casual dress code. Flexible with their tattoo policy.\r\n- I feel like Chase has handled the COVID19 pandemic with ease, in my opinion. They've allowed us to work from home, kept us in the loop regarding any important updates, were understanding if we had computer issues, provided us with the necessary home equipment, provided us with extra sick time, and were overall really flexible.", "cons": "- I started out as a phone agent in collections, and I was able to be promoted to a Real Time Analyst within a year. Perhaps I just got lucky. But over time, I've realized there is hardly any opportunity for promotions or career advancement. My suggestion would be to start out as a call center agent or any entry-level position, to at least get your foot in the door. Especially if you've just graduated high school or maybe need a decent recognizable brand on your resume. Since Chase is a large company, try and move up the corporate ladder if you're able to. \r\n- The biggest issue I have while working here, is the low pay. Despite having excellent annual reviews every year, management claims that I'm on the \"high end\" of the pay scale within my pay grade, and that I'm ineligible for a pay raise. But with Chase not offering any career advancement opportunities, I'm pigeonholed until I can find another job that pays more. So that's something to be mindful of.\r\n- Like most call center environments, there can be gossip and drama. Try your best not to engage in any of that."}], [{"review_title": "Good Work Life Balance", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "1 Oct 2021", "job_title": "AVP-IT in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "culture is good ,work in tech is good , peer group is competetive,senior management is talented", "cons": "salary hikes and promotions are hard to achieve"}, {"review_title": "lakjalkgalk", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supportive mentors, Work and Life Balance", "cons": "This column is not applicable"}, {"review_title": "Excellent place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "28 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Vice President in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing culture, helpful management, work life balance, learning opportunities", "cons": "None.
