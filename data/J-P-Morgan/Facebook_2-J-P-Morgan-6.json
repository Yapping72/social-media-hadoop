Way too much time is spent on admin requirements\r\n- Power and influence is highly concentrated in the hands of Directors and lower-level employees rarely have a say on things\r\n- There is no culture of mentorship in the business. Managers and Senior Managers only want to exploit junior members during projects and discard them afterwards when they don't need them. Therefore, there is little support for mentorship and little altruism/empathy\r\n- Directors rarely talk to juniors and they often don't answer emails if you are not senior enough\r\n- Hiring policies are highly immoral as they try to get overqualified people to sign contracts for positions that are lower in rank than anywhere else in the market, therefore offering them lower wages than what they are worth\r\n- HR sides with the business 10/10 cases and there is no impartiality, therefore HR can't be relied on at all\r\n- A significant amount of travel is often required, therefore negatively work-life balance\r\n- IT is very poor, makes most projects a nightmare\r\n- Diversity at senior levels is a joke.
