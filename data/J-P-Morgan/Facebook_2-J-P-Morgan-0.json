My accomplishments are numerous and far surpass that of most of the colleagues and managers I've worked under. I've single handedly created solutions that were implemented globally that created millions of dollars in value from automated efficiencies and barely received a thank you. And creating these solutions weren't even apart of my job description, they were just extra curricular for me to build and help other people solve problems faster. Some people with minor results have achieved great success at getting promoted almost annually just cause they are well liked and chat it up nice with managers around the water cooler. But the value these people bring is minimal if not devaluing to those around them that actual do produce.

Pay is fairly good when entering the company and for similar roles. The Grad schemes have a very good pay structure. Depending on the team the work isn't that demanding most of the time Managers are more lenient than they should be with poor-quality or slowly delivered work than they should be. This is either a pro or con depending on your situation The interview process isn't a 4 stage ordeal like some other higher prestige tech companies and doesn't revolve solving leetcode questions nor making long presentations depending on the role. This could be a con because some inferior employees sometimes slip through the cracks There are a lot of helpful internal tools. Free Coffee? I don't drink Coffee so I don't care about this one but if you do like Coffee it's a plus. Though I hear it isn't good so people go to Pret/Starbucks anyway. Depending on the LOB there are plenty of Social Events for networking. You will work with talented people usually.", "cons": "3 Days a Week in the Office is just stupid when every other Bank has at most 2 days in the office. Though managers are increasingly taking a more liberal view of this policy The 3 days in the office have caused a lot of very talented people to leave and talented developers are not joining. Manager Russian Roulette. Some Managers are really good and some are terrible. A lot of time your team leaders are too busy (too many meetings) to do tasks such as 1-2-1s, and other support. A Mid-Year review basically boiled down to me saying I thought I was doing a good job and that was it. You'll be in a lot of meetings due to most teams being distributed. This can pose difficulties when the same team is spread over time zones. I've been in teams with members in Houston and Mumbai who never overlap in working hours. You will get a lot of emails. A lot of which will have no impact on your job. If you stay in a team long enough it will be moved around organizationally. A lot of managers do not know the HR policy well at all. This results in some minor levels of exploitation as I was not made aware that covering support work for a week constituted a payment. This went on with my team for years and took 6 months from finding out about this system to be back paid for these activities. Working on Weekends is sometimes expected depending on the team for certain activities. Salary Ranges are deliberately obscured and discussion between employees is taboo. So I imagine a lot of people are underpaid. You're working in a bank so there are a lot of processes to get access to tools to do your job Onboarding documentation is done on a team-to-team basis so you're at the mercy of that team's documentation Periods of benching in certain teams/roles. End-of-Year pay rises and Bonuses have been curbed due to COVID even though the bank has made record profits. From my understanding, you will only get minor rises in pay unless you come with an offer from another company. Furthermore, if you move teams during the team your bonus budget will be shared between both teams. This results in a lot of people getting a cut bonus and has caused at least one person to leave shortly after this. A lot of Cognizant consultants are used and they are at times very bad (though some are really good) I don't understand why it's cheaper to get to 2 consultants when one full-time developer would be better long-term. Internal Job Grade promotions take a very long time to materialize. I would advise that it is easier to leave and get a promotion than move internally. I would estimate it takes about 5 years to move between each Officer Title Assoc -> VP -> ED -> MD. Though I would add that these job titles are tangibly worthless, outside of not getting overtime once you hit VP, and if you want more responsibility/money the best course of action would be to move around. You're not going to be working on \"fun\" greenfields tech or activities. Developers'roles will mostly be around writing boilerplate Java. Or if you're in the business/project management side combing through Jira or Excel, to plan for said boilerplate Java tasks. One Senior ex-colleague said once he was made redundant that he was happy he didn't need to go into \"The Most Boring Office in the World\" anymore. Take of that what you will I've been here for over 5 years I think the lifelessness has a certain charm to it. I don't know if this is just the people I work with or me. Still, I find a lot of people to lack emotional or situational intelligence with meetings being canceled last minute or just not attending a meeting that was created for them in mind. Certain decision-making can be obscured and lengthened in certain LOBs because of the amount of middle management in it i.e. Too Many Cooks in the Kitchen If you need stuff done you're better off doing it yourself. A lot of time people will not perform tasks or actions for you unless you have a superior job title to them or bring someone with a superior job title into the conversation. Even people you're meant to be in the same team with. Like many businesses, there is a ton of butt-kissing which at times verges on the embarrassing. Too many talented people, who have better things to do, do not get rewarded properly because of this and leave There is a lot of Regulatory training for financial stuff even if you're in tech. This is almost always half-arsed by every employee. Been in positions where a line manager is responsible for multiple disparate teams within the same organization which don't really collaborate with each other. Which causes the line manager to become extremely stretched and causes issues to slip through the cracks. In some teams, it has been unclear what the exact role of the team is and due to this a team does much disparate Management uses terms such as Agile, DevOps, and SRE but doesn't actually do such tasks. So many Project Managers I've encountered call themselves Agile but don't do Agile properly or at all"}, {"review_title": "J.P.

No cubicles. Instead, they have what they call \"high performance work stations\". Those are small desks with a computer and two screens at each. Every one of those got a camera. Chances are you're always on camera - meetings happen quite often. So it's leaving you with almost zero privacy. No picking nose while running queries. The organization is very bureaucratic. You will need approval for everything. Even if you have access to any platform, you will not be able to perform certain operations there. These will require individual requests to be approved by tech people located all over the place. May take weeks to get proper access privileges. Their return to office policy is inflexible and pretty weird. You can't work from home the same days week to week. Instead you must alternate one or both of these days.
