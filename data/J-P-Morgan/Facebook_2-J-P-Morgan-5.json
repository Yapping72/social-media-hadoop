You learn while having fun and trust me; you don\u2019t implement anything that you learn in your training on the floor. On the floor, it is all about you and how fast you pick up things (not much support will be given in that aspect as you are expected to learn everything on your own)\r\n\r\nGRADUATION: You graduation which is a fun little activity to showcase the new bakras; sorry !!! Employees to join the team.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT COACHING: This is mostly theoretical and for a job which is mostly practical; the tools, system and method used is archaic and outdated. Nevertheless, the trainers are hardworking and smart, however they are stuck with a bad management who neither wants to take any feedback or give any.\r\nJOB: Here comes the meat of the story. You ready, it is going to be a bit lengthy so please be patient. \r\nTOOLS AND SYSTEM: Outdated, pathetic and slow. You cannot do anything about it, despite being a global bank and ranking in the top 20 organisations of the world \u2013 it is pathetic to see they are stuck with slow systems, outdated OS, applications which lag and no dedicated IT support. And these issues are known but no one will do anything about it. If you are working from home \u2013 you will be asked to change your internet provider. If WFO, and if you have these experiences \u2013 then you are just damn UNLUCKY. \r\n\r\nTEAM LEADS: One of the best things about this place \u2013 the TLs. Because most of them have experienced the issues or continue experiencing them; they support and try to get the best support and feedback possible. However, some of them are downright arrogant, bias and overbearing.\r\nTHE JOB: The metric and targets are unachievable. You should be 100% at most of parameters and you are expected to achieve 100% of them. The calls are continuous (with 100s waiting on the line), customers are cranky, and process is complicated and continuously changing, metrics are unachievable, management is always breathing down your neck and threatening to fire you (yes, it happens \u2013 the senior leaders will take you to a meeting room and will threaten you in the sweetest possible manner). \r\nYou are expected to take more calls (around 40 to 50 per day) to achieve desirable results, expected to do overtime, expected not to take any breaks (apart from the scheduled two 15 minutes breaks and lunch). You are expected to provide excellent customer service to customers who are constantly cussing. \r\n\r\nTHE JOB TEACHES YOU A LOT ABOUT FRAUD AND THE TREND. However the management is atrocious. And you might have a question WHY? The answer is simple \u2013 YOU ARE REPLACEABLE. There is constant hiring and the management looks for fresh blood every season. It\u2019s a vicious cycle and unfortunately that is state of Indian job market. Our government is incompetent and employers are outright selfish. What are left in between are people like us who works hard and look for growth. Unfortunately, Chase India is no different from any other MNC, you have the politics, the attrition and new targets."}, {"review_title": "Review Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Associate in Powai, Maharashtra", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Agile methodology, get chance to work on development , do releases and production support", "cons": "Extended work hour sometimes to meet deadline"}, {"review_title": "A good brand to work with", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Financial Analyst in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work life balance in the firm", "cons": "A bit operational in working terms"}, {"review_title": "Great Salary, awful management, souless corporate", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Jun 2021", "job_title": "KYC Officer in Bournemouth, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Salary, Great Benefits, Great Campus", "cons": "Poor Management, Woke, Soul destroying corporate sludge"}, {"review_title": "Great workplace", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Senior Business Analyst in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "BEst place to work , good team spirit", "cons": "Timing has to be overlapped with US."}, {"review_title": "Very good Company to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Senior Associate in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good Company to work", "cons": "There will be some pressure at times."}, {"review_title": "NA", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "14 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Integration Manager in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best company to work with", "cons": "Nothing as such that i have identified during my tenure"}], [{"review_title": "Relaxed work environment but not much to learn", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 May 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.

"N/A", "pros": "LEAVES, LEARNING, NOT MUCH OUT HERE", "cons": "So, you plan to work at Chase India as Fraud Specialist. Without wasting any time let me go ahead and give you some quirks of working here so that you are not surprised during or at the end of your tenure.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, it is a call centre guys, PERIOD. During training, they will make it sound like you are a very important department and your work is exquisite which you will fall for. However, it is a call centre like any other with odd shifts, politics, and favoritism (screaming customers, unachievable targets and micromanagement by managers and bots are part of everyday life). \r\n\r\nI will give you a breakdown of exactly what happens at this place and please be aware that this is for Bangalore location as Fraud Specialist 1 only.\r\nTRAINING: Wonderful training, it is analogous to the honeymoon period in every office. You learn while having fun and trust me; you don\u2019t implement anything that you learn in your training on the floor. On the floor, it is all about you and how fast you pick up things (not much support will be given in that aspect as you are expected to learn everything on your own)\r\n\r\nGRADUATION: You graduation which is a fun little activity to showcase the new bakras; sorry !!! Employees to join the team.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT COACHING: This is mostly theoretical and for a job which is mostly practical; the tools, system and method used is archaic and outdated. Nevertheless, the trainers are hardworking and smart, however they are stuck with a bad management who neither wants to take any feedback or give any.\r\n\r\nJOB: Here comes the meat of the story. You ready, it is going to be a bit lengthy so please be patient. \r\n\r\nTOOLS AND SYSTEM: Outdated, pathetic and slow. You cannot do anything about it, despite being a global bank and ranking in the top 20 organisations of the world \u2013 it is pathetic to see they are stuck with slow systems, outdated OS, applications which lag and no dedicated IT support. And these issues are known but no one will do anything about it. If you are working from home \u2013 you will be asked to change your internet provider. If WFO, and if you have these experiences \u2013 then you are just damn UNLUCKY. \r\n\r\nTEAM LEADS: One of the best things about this place \u2013 the TLs. Because most of them have experienced the issues or continue experiencing them; they support and try to get the best support and feedback possible. However, some of them are downright arrogant, bias and overbearing.\r\n\r\nTHE JOB: The metric and targets are unachievable. You should be 100% at most of parameters and you are expected to achieve 100% of them. The calls are continuous (with 100s waiting on the line), customers are cranky, and process is complicated and continuously changing, metrics are unachievable, management is always breathing down your neck and threatening to fire you (yes, it happens \u2013 the senior leaders will take you to a meeting room and will threaten you in the sweetest possible manner). \r\nYou are expected to take more calls (around 40 to 50 per day) to achieve desirable results, expected to do overtime, expected not to take any breaks (apart from the scheduled two 15 minutes breaks and lunch). You are expected to provide excellent customer service to customers who are constantly cussing. \r\n\r\nTHE JOB TEACHES YOU A LOT ABOUT FRAUD AND THE TREND. However the management is atrocious. And you might have a question WHY? The answer is simple \u2013 YOU ARE REPLACEABLE. There is constant hiring and the management looks for fresh blood every season. It\u2019s a vicious cycle and unfortunately that is state of Indian job market. Our government is incompetent and employers are outright selfish. What are left in between are people like us who works hard and look for growth. Unfortunately, Chase India is no different from any other MNC, you have the politics, the attrition and new targets."}, {"review_title": "this is great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in Hong Kong", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great place, nice guy , pretty woman", "cons": "poor workload, demanding , toe fast"}, {"review_title": "Typical Corporate Environment.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Learn the importance of career planning.", "cons": "Systemic issues persist throughout the organization."}, {"review_title": "Okay place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 May 2021", "job_title": "Associate in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Technically smart people around you, generally very helpful", "cons": "if you are not in the good books of your manager you will be screwed repeatedly year and year again"}, {"review_title": "GOOD", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer (SDE) I in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good culture and timely bonus", "cons": "No cons . . ."}, {"review_title": "Big bank small salary", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 May 2021", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance is good for tech", "cons": "Salary is low comparing to other banks and IT companies"}], [{"review_title": "Mature Workspace with excellent ethics", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.
