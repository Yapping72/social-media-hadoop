They are old people with poor understanding of technology and all decisions are taken based on what other US companies are publicly doing\r\n\r\n2. People from HQ steal many project ideas as they need to approve them. They will say \"please do not work on this item idea because we are already working on it at HQ\". Then, they will ran back to HQ and create a project based on your idea or team idea. HQ stole to big projects from my team in just two years.\r\n\r\n3. Similarly HQ will also steal the patents generated by you or your team and i have known some instances in which patents submitted from usa to south korea for approval come back with different author names.\r\n\r\n4. Finally, since all funding comes from HQ your managers at Samsung research america (usa) will be powerless after all the abuses you suffer. \r\n\r\nIn summary, Samsung is a follower company, following the work of leading companies such as apple and this is so embedded in their culture that they even follow and steal ideas from each other within the company.\r\n\r\nStay away please if you are an independent and innovative researcher.

You get issues at 5PM you should finish it even if it takes you 12AM midnight; you stay; you complete; you go. (In some teams of course and unluckily it was mine). You are nothing but a bug fixer in the eyes of HQ guys. But I think you can learn more and get into any flow deeper if you are in Korea or in the Bangalore team than in the Noida office.
