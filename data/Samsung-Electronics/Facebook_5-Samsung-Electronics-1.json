There was very high workload and work-life balance was not good. \r\n\r\nI requested for training and it was rejected even though the training was for a new type of ID work that was not discussed at the interview or documented in the job description. Lots of surprises, not very pleasant. \r\n\r\nAs an ID, there was very little action taken based on best practices and data driven decision making. Decisions were made based on whatever the manager representing 'client' Samsung wanted. There was lots of micro aggression, no documented best practices and a top down approach focused on 'the client' manager instead of evidence based approach that shows what works and what doesn't work.
