Reality doesn't matter, it's how good the reports look to the next level of management up that counts for everything. And because such a vast quantity of data is reported so ridiculously frequently, it simply isn't humanly possible for any of what you report to ever be checked or verified. Combine this with the fact that you start every project knowing the strategy will change, or the goalposts move long before anything ever gets delivered, and the fact that your department head will ultimately be someone with no understanding of what it is that you actually do, and you can pretty much get away with doing nothing. Just keep the reports coming, and work late occasionally to \"show commitment\".

Ultimately, Korean management has no trust or respect for Westerners. There isn't a single important decision made in this company that isn't ultimately signed off (and often reversed at the last minute) by a Korean. Even senior Westerners have to defer to Korean \"superiors\" who almost always are less experienced and knowledgeable than they are, but are in charge because they are Korean. The racism openly displayed in this company simply wouldn't be tolerated if Western and Korean roles were reversed, but as with most things, it's excused as \"culture\".\r\n\r\n- When you leave and go to a company with a 21st century management style of empowerment and trust, you actually find yourself struggling a little bit with simple decisions and freedoms because not once at Samsung will you ever have had any real autonomy.

It pains me to say this, but little will change in the next few months or years, and then one fine week Samsung will wake up and panic like child that can\u2019t find his favorite blanket and within a matter of weeks/months, Samsung will try to reorganize and evolve its culture. This strategy has worked thus far, but if it will continue to work in the future, is yet to be seen. Either way, it has meant a hemorrhaging of fantastic talent and Samsung has not lived up to its full potential. While I know that this review has been mostly negative, I will also say this; if Samsung shapes up it could easily dominate the industry. Most Samsung employees are proud that in a single year Samsung was able to turn its business around and go from feature phones to becoming the leading smart-phone manufacture. Which is pretty dumb in my opinion. If Samsung had planned and listened properly to both internal and external chatter they could possibly leading the pact instead of following Apple\u2019s lead. This is not to say that turning the business around isn\u2019t a great achievement, its just that Samsung probably put the same amount of man power to produce this effect in one year, that Apple took three years to craft. Thus, while Samsung may be efficient (debatable) it is not very effective.", "cons": "THIS is for Samsung HQ in KOREA\r\n\r\nSo let me preface this as this is/was the structure of the company circa 2010 to mid 2011. While the company is unified under one umbrella name, it does not function as a cohesive organism. Each department is independent; this leads to a great number of rational actors and the problems that plague negotiation between departments.  To cut to the point, each HR is independent, so while one may say/state very appealing terms of contract, your actual HR may decide not to deliver /fulfill them. This is most problematic as it seems there exists no formal communication between any department - not simply from HR to HR. I mean this in the broader sense. What this means for the new employee is that he/she is often lost and cannot find the answer to his question. I digress... \r\n\r\nLet me first focus on HR. The problem that prevails in Samsung is that no one has a specialization. One would think that in company the size of Samsung, the HR would be headed by people that understand the department, its polices and the simple fact that HR is suppose to help make the employee's life better. But the HR as with every other division with in Samsung comes from a scattered group of people - former engineers, linguists, fresh liberal arts graduates etc... the problem with this is that these people, though they may be inherently smart (or so says their degree from the top universities of Korea), are simply not prepared for their roles. They do not know how to manage, let alone have the knowledge to support an employee. Problems are exacerbated by a number of factors; some departments reorganize themselves up to 2 times a year. I cannot say with the greatest certainty how that affects the HR, but it certainly can have a demoralizing effect on the employees.\r\n\r\nWhile I am sure I can write a book about my experience thus far, allow me to narrow the scope of focus. \r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n\tWhile initial setup can be taxing and time consuming, I have never known it be as stressful or daunting as in Samsung. Most companies would have their employees working by day two, where as Samsung\u2026 you can wait upwards of two weeks. It boggles the mind to know that Samsung is a technology company yet it cannot provide its own employees with fully set-up, working computer, in the target language. The computer comes bear, and all software/drivers need to be installed \u2013 of course, the first installation is completely in Korea, making it impossible for the Korean illustrate to function. Furthermore, it is task in itself to find someone that knows how to set up the computer in English; as in the finding the correct software etc. \r\n\r\nWork:\r\n\tAs stated before each department is independent; this translates to several departments that have overlapping responsibilities/work without any clear consensus on who should be leading/ownership or the strategy moving forward. Without making this any longer, the basic jest of it is that it entirely depends on the group one works in. But as a general rule, do not expect to be thrown in and be doing meaning full work right away. \t\r\n\tSamsung is much like the proverbial \u2013 smart, last minute college student. Eg. When Samsung could draft plans early on, the company organization/culture does not seem support such a strategic endeavor, instead things are left done at the last minute with tremendous amounts of overtime. At this point \u2013 I would say most of Samsung still functions as top-down company. Whatever the upper management decrees must be done, there is very little questioning and foresight. \r\n\r\nOther things to note:\r\n-\tYou must work 9 hours a day; otherwise you won\u2019t get paid \u2013 be it productive or not\r\n-\tYour work all depends on your group (I stress this point, if you have a good group then you are lucky)\r\n-\tOvertime work is almost mandatory; be it because of culture (Korean face time), organization (last minute dealings), or otherwise.\r\n-\tLanguage: unless you are VERY lucky, almost all communications are in Korean \u2013 emails, meetings, reports etc. \r\n-\tSecrecy: Samsung is stupidly paranoid and groups never fully understand what other groups are doing. Often projects are repeated due to a lack of shared information. Even code that is shared, will not be fully explained.\r\n-      Promotions are not based on actual competence, but on seniority (for the most part). Which is extremely disheartening for the ambitious. \r\n\r\nSamsung can be best described as from a quote that I overheard\u2026\r\n\u2018Samsung is not a global company, Samsung is a Korean company with global operations.\u2019"}, {"review_title": "Global player, to stay on top and rise even further", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Oct 2013", "job_title": "Junior Product Manager in Frankfurt am Main", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Infrastructure, challenges, freedom, management task, advanced training, perks", "cons": "work/life balance, long hours, sometimes plans are spontaneously overthrown, resulting in \"dynamic\" inconsistency, sometimes your career path is not made very clear"}], [{"review_title": "Marketing Senior Manager", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great environment, corporate responsibilities and very committed people.

No trust in employees. \r\n - For example, there are security gates in every building and 6~7 security guards who swipe you when you pass the gate. Literally you are passing the security gate of an airport when you pass every building. And they use that stick to swipe you.\r\n - It is painstakingly difficult to take your computer out of the office, thus literally no one does it.\r\n\r\n2. Poor IT infrastructure\r\n - Even though it is an IT company, you don't have access to almost all IT tools that allows efficient work. For example, most of the employees don't use Outlook. Recently, not even Microsoft Word.\r\n - Samsung has a tool called MySingle, created by Samsung SDS. And if you want to experience one of the worst IT tools in the world join the team.\r\n\r\n3. Inefficient\r\n - On top of the lack of IT tools, you will see people here sit in their desks writing reports for their bosses 80% of their time. These reports are for either their boss or their boss to report to their boss. This report is revised every time it goes up the chain of command. I have spent over a day writing a 2 page presentation file for a executive here. And it was with 5 people!\r\n - Let me give you another fun example of inefficiency. In order to submit a form or send an email to a senior person (note, not even an executive), you need to call that person's subordenient and get her/him to understand everything about what you want to do. If you don't you willl not get your form approved or get the thing you want to get done which you wished through the email sent. FYI this might take a week to get done.\r\n\r\n4. Endless reporting\r\n - Reporting will consumes 80% of your time.\r\n - And good reporting skill is highly valuable in Samsung Electronics. Of course reporting on the thing that you worked on and put effort into is not bad. But, in Samsung Electronics the actual work you do is not really important, it's all about reporting. And the reporting is very frequent. For instance, for some projects you will have to report to your executive, your team's executive, the CEO, etc. And for every report it will consume at least 1 day.

Some senior managers have no respect for private or family emergencies and have no qualms in calling or messaging past 10:00 pm for a mundane task or question, even on the weekends. Also, some of the strict compliance policies have become roadblocks to carrying out simple tasks that seriously hinders efficiency.
