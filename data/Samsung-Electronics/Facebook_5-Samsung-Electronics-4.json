The management and company culture are notorious bad. They exploit employee to contribute patent to company. It counts into your half-year assessment which is the reference for your bonus.

Their the manager controls substantial portion of your yearly income, and that will serve a great leverage for the manager to exploit the employee.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that their company IT is notoriously poor. For example, my current American company outsources the IT architecture to professional IT service vendor (such as Citrix). When you got some trouble on your PC, all you need to do is to make a phone call to the help desk, and you quickly get a professional IT service to fix your computer. Nonetheless, in Samsung, fixing your own PC is a part of your skill in your work. You have to fix your own PC or you will be treated incompetence. The group which I worked for in Samsung does have a Korean IT guy. However, he acted like your boss. You have to beg him to fix your PC or your may have to wait for a long time, and you may not finish your job because of that. Your manager won't listen to your \"excuse\" saying that you could not finish your work on time because your PC has some issue. blah blah blah ..."}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "3.0",

Remember that managers in Korea HAVE TO be respected by employees. Managers are god. They can do whatever they want, and even humiliating you in public. This is what those people have. If you have Korean background, then good luck with that. If you don't have it, you will have less opportunities to get promoted. Yes, this is who they are. \r\n\r\nThey prefer bi-lingual, because they can control employees badly. These Koreans don't have critical authority for hiring decision but they still do. Those Koreans love to get involved in anything and everything. During any meetings, if you don't get interrupted by them for 5 mins, then you are super lucky. They don't give you opportunities to speak at any meeting at all. I assume that they don't trust you in general. The best part of those Koreans is they are REALLY good at criticizing. They can find what your weakness is and what you did wrong. This is super easy for them. They have Phd for that. \r\n\r\nKorean culture has good and bad, and these people introduce all bad korean culture. Actually, HQ has much better culture based on what friends say. That's why Samsung Electronics reputation is higher on glassdoor than it should be. \r\n\r\nI still recommend it because work is rationally more than okay, and you can learn a lot.

Encouraging employees to quit smoking was great idea; forcing them to take blood tests for nicotine and checking CCTV / building entry logs to identify smokers and penalize them in performance reviews, not so great and might be illegal in first world countries."}], [{"review_title": ".", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Nov 2020", "job_title": "FW Developer in Seoul", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "M.S. at computer architecture\r\nwork at samsung now", "cons": "newbie\r\nI just want watching notice.\r\nI don't want a new job"}, {"review_title": "Stable, good benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "1 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Staff Engineer in Hanoi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Global colleagues, env, good benefits, stable", "cons": "Something slow, equally between employees"}, {"review_title": "not bad", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Lawyer in Bangkok", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "pretty nice cant complain all good", "cons": "all good no complaints, very happy"}, {"review_title": "samsung Mechanical Enginner", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Mechanical Engineer in Seoul", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High self-esteem and working conditions", "cons": "Discrimination between regular and non-regular workers"}, {"review_title": "One of great workplace in Korea", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "19 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Principal Software Engineer in Suw\u014fn, Kyonggi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free meals, Good working environments, Good Gym", "cons": "Low salary compare as works, uncleared compensation"}, {"review_title": "SRI-D Review", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Noida", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free food and free transport", "cons": "Stringent company policies\r\nFixed work hours"}, {"review_title": "Great Company with a positive outlook", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Senior Engineer in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "excellent and knowledgeable people to work with", "cons": "Work life balance need some work"}, {"review_title": "Recommended", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Sales Engineer in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fair.
