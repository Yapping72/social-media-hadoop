I have worked for global MNE's for 20 years as a professional subject matter expert but was completely unprepared and unsuited for the working environment at Huawei. \r\n\r\nThe internal language is Chinese and the standard of business English, both written and spoken, is very poor making it difficult for non Chinese speaking employees to understand what is required from them or to engage meaningfully with Chinese colleagues on technical issues. The lack of Chinese language skills meant I was unable to carry out my role effectively despite having the requisite technical knowledge and experience. \r\n\r\nHuawei boasts that 70% of its UK employees are locally hired, which may be the case, but predominantly this is from the local Chinese community for all roles except those which require specific professional skills or expertise.  \r\n\r\nIn my opinion it does not provide a suitable work environment for non Chinese employees unless they are prepared to accept a very heirarchical business culture and way of working where everyone is expected to follow globally defined processes to the letter and accept that compliance with these processes will be assessed, measured, audited, scored and ultimately rewarded or punished. There is no trust between HQ and internationally based employees. \r\n\r\nThere is a total lack of autonomy for locally hired staff no matter how senior or expert they are. Subject matter experts are regarded as internal consultants rather than business decision makers. All business decisions are made between Chinese local management and HQ in China and all discussions and meetings are conducted in Chinese with little or no opportunity for the non Chinese staff  to participate. \r\n\r\nI am used to a significant amount of autonomy when carrying out my specialist role coupled with the ability to contribute opinions, ideas and experience to influence ways of working in my functional organisation both locally and globally. I was told that this was one of the main reasons I was being hired but ultimately this did not come to fruition. It was clear that I was to have no opportunity to contribute or influence global processes beyond an initial \"knowledge dump\" of the ways of working of my previous employer who was a competitor of Huawei. I was there to be harvested of the knowledge I had in my head and once this had occurred I was \"put  out in the field\" to work.

There are more important things than money, as you will discover here.  Shenzhen is a hodgepodge of a fishing town cum industrial pit with a veneer of tech sector. A small fishing town that got converted hastily to a large city without considering the environmental or societal impact. English is rarely spoken in most of the city. \r\n\r\nThe only areas that provide a western level of life if you are not Chinese are near the coast in Shekhou, but the transportation infrastructure is so insanely poor (terrible traffic, tons of new drivers that are so unsophisticated and new to the concept that all they know how to do is gridlock, poorly designed subway lines) that getting to and from the Huawei campus cannot be done in under 90 minutes each way. You cannot buy a car as license plates are only given by the Chinese government via a lottery due to the massive demand for new cars by Chinese people. In other words, kiss time with your family goodbye during the weekdays, as Huawei does not have work from home arrangements or flex time. You are expected to clock in at 8:30 and clock out at 6:00pm and your manager will receive notification, and you will receive notices of your pay being docked when you are not on time. \r\n\r\nLiving in the international areas, someone with a family gets to \"enjoy\" seeing the massive legalized prostitution industry for expat executives with second wives at work every night at bars, massage parlors and so on. International schools are in that vicinity. If you are not Ok with people spitting on the street around you all the time because their airways are clogged by smog, or tossing cigarette buts and trash on the ground at random, this is not for you.\r\n\r\nShenzhen is very hot and humid (think Houston Tx), but way more polluted than Houston, so a 10 minute walk outside during the day will leave you covered in a thin layer of stinky grime and yearning for a shower, as wind does not really blow inland since the seafront is completely blocked by tall buildings. \r\n\r\nHuawei culture can feel highly hostile to foreigners. Zero work life balance that treats every foreigner no matter their level as a factory worker. You can negotiate exceptions, but when you are part of a team the pressure to comply is tremendous. Huawei is a Chinese company pretending to be global, and as with many things in China, puts on a thin facade to face the world (e.g. Messi and Scarlett Johansen on their ads). Massive amount of militaristic language and propaganda are constantly being pushed at employees to \"motivate\" them, making the environment feel extremely threatening, especially for non Chinese. For a full history of their discourse, read Huawei, Leadership, Culture, and Connectivity or search inside the google books version.\r\n\r\nIn the business culture of the company bribery and corruption are seen as acceptable forms of business like many third world countries, which in large part explains Huawei's success in places like Saudi Arabia and Africa, and why they are all but banned from doing business in the US.  \r\n\r\nOnce you start, you find out that your professional title means nothing, and the company reserves the right to change it to whatever they need whenever it is convenient to them (you can be a VP at an event one day, and a PM the next), severely undermining your personal credibility and reputation long term.  \r\n\r\nForget having control over your vacation days, as holidays are organized and moved around by the Chinese government. Huawei \"encourages\" employees to work the last Saturday of each month in exchange for holiday time. This also means that if an official holiday takes place and no one goes to work, they will all have to make it up on the Saturday afterwards. Theoretically these are voluntary work days, but everyone treats them as any other work day and they will expect you to be there for it.\r\n\r\nIf you came from a leading company with valuable IP, expect to be under constant pressure to divulge as much of it as possible and to be constantly fighting not to. The notion of an NDA or IP rights is nonexistent and not enforced by Chinese law in any way. If you ever want to come back to the west and work for a western employer, spending significant amount of time embedded in Huawei can likely become a liability, as over time this stuff tends to \"stick\".\r\n\r\nThere is no concept of employee/employer trust relationship, which makes one wonder how on earth a customer could trust Huawei. Non Chinese cannot receive Huawei stock.

You are treated like a bonded labour. You are required to punch in at 9.30 am. If you do not leaves are deducted in MINUTES( means fractions). This is totally insane.\n3) If you do not complete your hours for a week(via punch in punch out) your leaves are not deducted, its your salary which gets deducted. Now that's really stupid. If you have to have such a policy then deduct from leaves why salary?\n4) you are permited 8 times in a month to be late to office beyond 9.30am. If you are late you get an email called exceptions. If you do not close these exceptions again your salary is deducted and not leaves!!!\n5) Management here is a puppet of chinese. Management is not free to take independant decisions like in American or Eu based MNCs. Here its controlled by HQ( headquarters aka the chinese) . They have made sure each division is headed by a chinese. Therefore, sometimes you can see bad things happening but you can't do anything because you are not chinese!!!\n6) You have to work like crazy here. We at India Huawei office seem to have imbibed the chinese culture of no regards for employee. You are called at middle of night to office. You are made to work as much as 5 people will do in place of you. If there is no need of you in project you are released from the project immediately. That leads to change of skill. And due to frequent change of skills you become useless in Years. Then you go for interviews outside and fail and you have no other option but yo stick to this company for Years. \n7) company has no consideration for ex employees. To get your PF Huawei asks you to go to their office with forms filled. Then wait for finance for hours sometime days till they put their seal on it. Then you take forms back and go yourself to the PF office to submit. What the heck is this? You are thr fastest growing telecome company in thw world , you cant even submit PF forms for your ex employees ???\n8) Huawei eats your money if you are an ex employee. If you resign before bonus payout month your bonus is gone gone!! And bonus is a lot. Not just bonus, I had to email and chase finance for getting back my insurance premium money which ends when you leave the company. Aftet chasing for days they finally realized oh yes money needs to be credited!!\n\nIn short, work here if you value money much above your values, your personal life. Be ready to feel like a bonded labour and sometimes a slave!!!\n\nMy views : do not join this company. Its culture is good enough for china not for India.

It entraps operators and defeats competitors with attractive rates, and is then willing to suck the last drop of blood out of its employees to compensate for their cheaper rates. Those employed directly have plenty to complain about, but those of us who have been hired through sub-contractors are dealt with by Huawei Saudi Arabia in ways renowned slavers of the yore would be proud of. \r\nI had been hired 5 years back on a sub-par salary. I had joined it then partly because I was desperate, and the job-market was volatile in Saudi Arabia (it has been volatile for quite a few years now). And partly in the hope that in due time, with increments I will get there. I had recevied assuarances of increment, in due time, from the lower level management too of . \r\nHowever, with the passage of time I realised that I had made a blunder. Despite having received excellent evaluation marks/grades from my superiors over the last 5 years, I have yet to see an increment; not a single penny.  \r\nThe system is so messed up, that new comers who joined our team this year, without any prior experience, are getting more than us who joined 5 years ago. \r\nWhat left me hopeless is that two other colleagues of mine, who joined an year before me, have not had any increment in 6 years. One of them resigned this year for this very reason and went back to his home-country.  I too, am now actively looking for another job. \r\nSo before joining Huawei Saudi Arabia, make sure that you have negotiated a compensation amount that you should be comfortable with for a long long time.
