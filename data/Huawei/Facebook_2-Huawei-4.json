When I first told people I was going to work for a Chinese tech company, many in my circle advised me against it. At first, I felt it was not fair and maybe a little racist. But after 3.5 years there, now I know better: its not about what they look like or what language they speak or what food they eat. Its about what they do. This company is devoted to cheating, lying and deceiving people in the quest to acquire technology. Just 2 years ago or so, there was a lawsuit against Huawei by a former employee in Canada who said in a news article that Huawei was a vast intelligence operation. Based on what\r\nI saw and experiened, I feel this is true. Huawei has almost 30 \"research\" centers all over the world where their \"research\" just\r\ninvolves sourcing technology by any means possible. In the project I was in, they shipped a certain component that was export\r\ncontrolled and not meant for exporting to China by declaring an exemption themselves! They did it 3 times! I was twice asked to do something questionable and probably illegal but I declined. The company has rules on paper against such activities but well its just paper. I have never seen a culture so corrupt and full of deceit. What makes it worse is that, they abuse the hospitality of their host countries and slowly turn some of their non-Chinese employees to do things their way because employees are rewarded for their \"contributions\". I was not involved in 5G and I don't know anything about the CEO's daughter but I don't trust this company and would be the least surprised if accusations against her come out to be true, based on what I saw and experienced. Another interesting fact: I have been monitoring Glassdoor reviews for this company from years ago and I know for a fact that there were many negative reviews here and new reviews were not incoming - the reviews were stagnant for quite some time but then all of a sudden, I see some positive 1 liner reviews. These are all fake, trust me. What some of the older reviews say: \"Huawei is only interested in your former employer's IP\" etc are all so true. This company exists to cheat and its employees behave as if its their daily job - find a new way of acquiring technology and when they do, they rub their hands in glee thinking how smart they are. This is not a company where an engineer can make a career. The CEO Reng Zhengfei is the biggest cheerleader I know. He gives the most amazing, good-to-hear speeches but all are fake. Once he said in a BBC news article that Huawei doesnt need to spy since it has 90,000 engineers but he omitted the fact that these are not 90,0000 engineers but 90,000 incompetent imbeciles who rely on research centres abroad to feed them with technology acquired via questionable means. There is not a single new Chinese tech that is totally indigenous. I also met at least 2 employees in Huawei China that were ex-military so I am also inclined to believe what the US is saying. The non-local employees and managers from HQ try to act friendly with local staff but well role play is role play. There are many telltale signs giving them away when they try to convince you to \"collaborate\" with your former or other companies. At the end of day, we must keep in mind that this is not a British or German or Japanese or American company that has some decency. In all, I decided that my years there were not a total waste since I got to know what a scum company looks and operates like. I will take it as a good lesson learned. In summary, Huawei's research centers are not for research. They are just there to poach employees from rival companies."}, {"review_title": "Access to new technology", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Nov 2020", "job_title": "IT Project Manager in Lima, Lima Region", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "New learnings and access to new technology", "cons": "Balance between work and personal life is not so clear"}], [{"review_title": "No", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "24 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Shanghai, Shanghai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "No more opinion right now.", "cons": "To many overtime, no free time."}, {"review_title": "It's a good company for soft engineer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Salary and working environment", "cons": "lots of overtime working hours"}, {"review_title": "ok, but stressful environment alwys OT", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Kuala Lumpur", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "can learn many new technologies things", "cons": "high workload and stress environment"}, {"review_title": "Great place to grow as developer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "20 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You will be ahead the market in adopting new technologies.

Huawei is going through a stage of becoming leaders in its technical fields but has some catch-up to do. The higher-ups have realized the importance of technical expertise (especially from US) and put a lot of efforts in attracting and supporting technical leaders. For technically strong people from other established but more over-crowded companies, Huawei can be a good choice for a break-out role.\r\n\r\n- The company's financial is very strong and the overall morale is high.\r\n\r\nDon't underestimate the importance of a company's financial. It feels really differently when working for a company that grows in revenue vs. one that shrinks. Trust me as I've worked for more than a decade at one of the major IT company w/ 10+ consecutive quarters of revenue loss before joining Huawei. The difference is very distinct.\r\n\r\n- The company has a very effective way of execution.\r\n\r\nThis could be a double-edged sword as wrong decisions can be done quickly too :), but overall I found it very satisfying to work where the culture is to get things done. I am especially impressed by the work ethics of the colleagues in China and marvel at the execution style (where nothing is left out of the loop). In contrast, during my years at a major industry research lab, I see all these brilliant people brainstorming new ideas but takes forever to put an idea into a prototype or to production.", "cons": "- Huawei fundamentally still operates/manages like a Chinese company where centralized decisions were made and sometimes abrupt changes of policies. That could be hard for people who are used to the American company culture.\r\n\r\nI would say if you are not flexible enough you may not survive the first year of Huawei.\r\n\r\n- Working experiences may vary a great deal across groups\r\n\r\nThere is no uniform high standard of work satisfaction across different groups. It really depends. Some group may have high turn over, others may be thriving. It really depends on the leader of the group, how well he/she is able to align the group's work w/ company's business interests and can proactively weather the storm. So before joining Huawei, make sure to assess your leader and group well, there could be a high fluctuation of experiences. \r\n\r\n- Negative branding/PR issue\r\n\r\nBefore I joined Huawei, I was scared by the negative PR of Huawei. So if you decide to join Huawei, there may not be the kind of Halo effect of joining some prestigious companies (but if you ever get stuck in a \"prestigious\" company, you know how worthless \"prestige\" can be unless you get out of the company). Now having worked at Huawei for over two years, overall I really like the company and couldn't care less about the negative PR.\r\n\r\n- How long would Huawei's boom last?\r\n\r\nHuawei is clearly going through a window of rapid growth w/ expansions into new domains such as smart devices, IoT, 5G, etc. The last couple of years have been very good (thanks to the booming smartphone business). But how long would that last (given the volatility of cellphone business and the outlook of China's economy)? Nobody can tell. I'd say join Huawei now before the boom goes away and make sure you grow on the job so that you have more career assets to move on when things go bad. \r\n\r\n- Lack of diversity\r\n\r\nI'd say 80% of technical people are Chinese-speaking. So it could be hard for non-Chinese speaking employee to fit in. But in general colleagues are very nice and go out of the way to help our non-Chinese speaking colleagues."}, {"review_title": "An excellent job in a very diverse company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Network Energy Delivery Engineer in Port of Spain", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working in the enterprise delivery department is one of the best engineering roles to me in Huawei.

Being a CMMI level 5 company,\r\nthe experience with Huawei has many benefits. Eventhough it is infamous for its work culture,\r\nit will be good for your later career, because you will learn to cope with long work hours, unbalanced life and your productivity will also definitely increase, since the work is hectic usually.\r\nSo to summarize the pros and cons\r\n\r\nPros\r\n1. The initial learning curve is great for freshers compared to the usual Indian companies.\r\n2. You don't have sit in pool or bench waiting to get a project. There will be more than enough work \r\n   for you to do and learn.\r\n3. The job security is kind of top in the industry, unless you have a talent to mess things up.\r\n4. Since there is no work from home option, you don't have to carry the workload to your home. \r\n   But the downside is that you should find time to go home. In some departments, it is very difficult.\r\n5. If you get posted in the core telecom departments, the experience you gain, worth much in the industry.\r\n6. You will learn new technologies at a good speed by yourself without any training. That is the way things work there. This will help a lot in future.", "cons": "Cons\r\n1. Unbalanced work life. Inefficient project planning, unattainable deadlines, which in turn squeeze \r\n   the employees to log long hours continuously for months even. My personal best was 33 hours at a stretch, just  taking 1 hour break for my basic needs. Many of my colleagues were logging 18 hours continuously in a day and this continued for many months even.\r\n2. Even though Bangalore division is hailed as an R&D division, most of the work will be maintaining projects developed in HQ, China. This depends on department, if you are in good departments you will  get good work. But if you work in some customization and release departments, the work is very bad and the experience does not worth much.\r\n3. In many departments, they recruit people on contract basis. They require more man power rather than skilled candidates. Sometimes even though you are in a developer position, you might not have to touch code for months even. This is bad for your career and don't choose to join on a contract position, if you have a better option.\r\n4. Many unnecessary processes and documentation are there for most projects. Many managers and TLs are following them so blindly that many are even not realizing the true purpose of it. Many stupid things are there just because they are like that in HQ and no one in the upper hierarchy dares to make even a suggestion to HQ.\r\n5. Your social online presence will be affected very much. Phones are not allowed in many departments and internet access is restricted to a worst degree, all in the name of security issues. You won't feel loyal to such an employer who has this much distrust on their employees. \r\n6. No flexible work timings. You have log in at a particular time and if you leave at proper time, you will be either frowned upon or you will be given additional work. Working from 930 to night 10 is considered normal and you will be getting concession for next day log in only if you stay late beyond 10pm."}, {"review_title": "A great Chinese owned international company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "23 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Huawei has a great leader, Mr. Ren, although he is not young now.

Mandatory training and awareness program, such as, Cyber Security, protection of data, working in customer environments etc. were given to all employees.  As a Project Manager, I was responsible for ensuring the team is aware and following-up to these rules.\r\n3.\tCareer build-up path for all employees, a unique competency program (categorized by professional areas) handled by a dedicated team to ensure all employees follow the plan. The expertise level was divided \u2013 each level represented the level of expertise (Solution Architecture, Business Analysis, Project Management, etc.).  In order to qualify for the next level, examination, on-line test, and experience in subject matter areas were counted in addition to the final interview by the expert committee who then recommended whether a person remains at the same level or moves to the next level.\r\n4.\tTeam-building sessions where not only you have fun but also working relationships were enhanced.

Sometimes, the total amount of bonus was twice or thrice your monthly salary.  \r\n9.\tOutstanding Employees of the month \u2013 each functional department manager across the organization selected an employee of the month person and that person name/picture was published company-wide via the newsletter. \r\n10.\tOccasionally the company announced special monetary awards for the money won via legal cases due to the internal or external cases.\r\n11.\tWorking with international teams gave us the opportunity to learn new cultures and adapt to new ways for working together.  As a Project Manager, it was critical for me that as a team we worked cohesively.\r\n12.\tThe integrated delivery service for the project was the most challenging part as you have to communicate with several internal parties plus the customer to ensure the project delivery is a success.\r\n13.\tAll of the above points made Huawei Technologies Pakistan an exciting place to work where not only I enjoyed the work but at the same time I also had fun.", "cons": "1.\tLack of a good insurance as compared to other leading companies in Pakistan \u2013 the company provided only the employee insurance and it didn\u2019t include the employee\u2019s family. Huawei is one of the leading telecom solutions providers in Pakistan and despite of having several meetings with the management, there was no agreement.\r\n2.\tLanguage barrier \u2013 in Pakistan the business language is English \u2013 it was difficult to talk directly to the Chinese staff at HQ (mostly speak Chinese) in China and always required some kind of intervention from the Chinese staff in Pakistan.  \r\n3.\tMandatory E-Timecard was also a nuisance -- since the company is projectized, there was no need for a time card, and rather the completion of the project commitment should have been looked into.\r\n4.\tPre-sales over commitment with the customer always caused the project delivery a costly endeavor.  We always found conflicting statements at the time of requirement gathering where customer interpretation was different than the Pre-sales staff commitment. \r\n5.\tAlthough we had a centralized portfolio management, the project always found a mismanagement of resources causing delay and a lot of negotiations were negatively impacting the project.\r\n6.\tManagement over-commitment with the customer also caused delay and the project cost overrun.  Specifically, the strategic projects always impacted the on-going projects because of the heavy resource manipulation.\r\n7.\tThe email publicized the name of the individual and the crime (taking bribe from customer, illegal use of company property etc.) the person committed to all worldwide employees. The name of the person should not be mentioned in the email. \r\n8.\tRelocation also caused anguish among employees \u2013 turnover was high when relocation is considered by the company.\r\n9.\tThe diverse location (different countries) of the staff felt that the location where the staff management is located has the upper hand as compared to their location.  \r\n10.\tPer Diem to the staff that belonged to different countries felt the policy should be the same rather than depending on the economic conditions of the country.

If you are on H1B, it can jeopardize your career. For GC and US Citizens, only reason you can work for this company is if they pay you well above the market compensation levels, but even then it is not worth it because of reasons stated below. Many companies are paying similar and not abusing their employees. \r\n2.\tPoor Management. No peer technical discussion. Managers will ask you to create a project plan assuming multiple resources available. Then they will not provide the resource, and use the project plan that you created to track you back, under totally unrealistic deadlines. Managers will provide wrong directions and hold you responsible for their incorrect decision making.\r\n3.\tLack of work ethics/decorum: Managers will pretend that they are doing you a favor by paying you more than people employed in China. They openly say in meetings that \u201cyou are paid 5x compared to Chinese employees so you should work 5x more\u201d. No effort estimate will be done for the work. You will go to meetings and they will review the items not done and humiliate you for what is not done. Again, I have been told, \u201cI don\u2019t care how it will be done or how many hours is needed, it needs to be done in 2 days\u201d. They will formally track your progress against an unrealistic schedule, probably because they would need this documentation for legal purposes when people are fired\r\n4.\tLack of power in US: Most decisions are made in China HQ. So your manager will blame you if your group missed a bug. Everyone higher up blames people down the hierarchy to save their jobs . Your manager will expose your weakness and hide your strength, so that if some thing wrong happens, they can blame and fire you while retaining their own job. This is true whether you are a manager or an employee. \r\n5.\tPoor infrastructure: IT infrastructure is poor. Compute resource is limited. Too much restriction in accessing documents etc causes loss in productivity. \r\n6.\tZero Training: Forget about training sessions. You will not learn anything because there are no training videos, poor documentation and even zero discussion. \r\n7.\tCompetition over co-operation: Managers here promote a culture of competition over co-operation. China folks don\u2019t trust US folks and vice versa. Everyone in US wants to be manager, no one wants to work\r\n8.\tCommunication problem + time zone issues: You will have to work with China folks starting from 7pm.

For things that are critical they tell employees to get it done and they don't care at all how it gets done(i.e. they are not involved technically).  For things that are not critical they expect employees to be super active and get amazing stuff done without having to spend any of their own effort.\r\n\r\n-Everyone is very political and nobody works together with a common goal.  Everything is centrally controlled from China and you can't see the organization chart in China, only the US.  It is very unclear what the management structure is.  Most people will have multiple managers, some in the US and some in China.\r\n\r\n-A lot of brainwashing by the HR team during their orientation.  They play lots of videos and try to hypnotize you into thinking you are saving the world.  They make you accept a book that was published by some executives and I'm suprised they don't force you to read it out loud.\r\n\r\n-They are paranoid about information security and have lots of restrictions which make it impossible to get anything done at work.  The management tells us to violate some of the company policies in order be able to get at least some stuff done and the IT people turn a blind eye to this.  People are constantly getting in trouble for violating some company policy.\r\n\r\n-Almost all of the important information for doing engineering work is located in China so it's almost impossible to get anything done in the US.  All of the decision making is made there.\r\n\r\n-There is no socializing at our company and it's very racially segregated.\r\n\r\n-Managers are very non-technical and the skill level of most employees is low.\r\n\r\n\r\n-During the process of setting personals goals for the year for which we will be evaluated there was no interaction with management besides extremely vague statements about what they wanted me to accomplish.  When I tried to get clarification I was blown off.\r\n\r\n-The company strategy is to just hire very experienced senior engineers in the US with more than 15yrs experience and milk them for knowledge.  HR and management don't try to hide this at all.  They are not interested in having a permanent presence in the US and developing the younger generation here.  Huawei employs about 180,000 people.  They are constanty shifting around what people do in China so the people there are not experts at anything.\r\n\r\n-The English skills of many of the people in the US and most people in China are very poor.  The communication style is also very indirect.  The good thing is the people in the US make a honest effort to communicate well(sometimes it's still not good enough though).  However, the bad thing is many people in China will not respond to numerous emails you send them.  There is no spirit of working towards a common goal with them.\r\n\r\n-Nobody on my project seems to care about doing a good job.  No matter how active I tried to be to promote good ideas and directions nobody responds to you at all.  It shows the attitude of the people there."}], [{"review_title": "Huaweian", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good place for learning, Nice HR management, good in salary hike some years:) better hierarchy to contact personnel when it was needed. very good for freshers to learn about telecom a lot.", "cons": "work life balance is not there\ud83d\ude0a, you should be dedicate your life for work that is how people work here"}, {"review_title": "Review of HTIPL Bangalore", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jun 2008", "job_title": "Technical Project Leader in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Exposure to great technology.\r\n- Performance based pay and promotion\r\n- Lots of opportunity to show your skills.", "cons": "- Employees are not made to feel valued and important\r\n- Absurdly stupid and useless attendance and timing rules\r\n- Lack of time to pursue personal techinal assignments\r\n- Enocurage people who slog\r\n- Lack of balance in work life vs personal life."}, {"review_title": "Huawei technology is a renown company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Oct 2008", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A high tech company with promising future.
