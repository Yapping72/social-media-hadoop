You are given way too much work for one person to handle and then chastised when you make one mistake. And this is not just my opinion, the proof is in the pudding. In San Francisco, the Adobe Digital team has hired over a dozen people in the last 2 years with all but one quitting prior to reaching their year mark (and Adobe pays out nice money for reaching a year). Yet they still tell interviewees what a wonderful place to work it is.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the managers of these disgruntled employees keep getting promoted and praised because the consulting group is still very profitable based on the premium they get for carrying the Adobe name. They are profitable and that seems to be all the VPs care about. The incredible part is that upper management is aware of these issues because of countless HR complaints, surveys and the out-of-control turnover, but they'd rather turn over the entire work force than fire the people responsible for the mess.\r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and away from Adobe Digital and possibly even Omniture altogether.

They literally openly threaten firing during conferences and meetings if you do not praticipate to their liking. I have spoken to a number of people who have missed family events years in a row or missed milestones like their child walking for the first time because they are expected to attend grueling meetings regardless. It is very clear that these people must give total control of their homelife to their spouse or partner, otherwise their home would be in shambles.\r\n\r\nExpect poor to no training or mentorship.  When you struggle, you will be blamed. You'll be pointed to the web with countless trainings that will teach you zero valuable skills.

Deck of Lies: I was asked to produce reports in a way to hid the scam which when refused, the director himself ensured to harass me.\r\n5. Appraisals: I single-handedly performed all finance operations smoothly. Yet, my appraisal was peanuts as I am an upfront person in reporting wrong practises.\r\n6. Skills: My manager could not even bear that I am more educated than him and better skills. He would get jealous when someone would send in appreciation.\r\n7. Over billing and kick backs: It can be easily seen over billing invoices being approved by managers and directors. Further no action is taken when these issues are reported.\r\n8. No use of Skip level meeting: Multiple times Sr Director is being reported of these malpractices going inside the company. But ultimately everything was informed and discussed with the managers/ directors with complainant name and this seemed that a particular group is together working towards corruption inside company."}], [{"review_title": "Career-building exprerience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Dec 2018", "job_title": "Account Executive in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Access to smart, strategic leaders\r\n-Ability to get promoted and recognized within\r\n-Investment in sales training, i.e. John Barrows and Vista Value Selling\r\n-Ability to make good money if you exceed quota", "cons": "-Constant changes within sales org, i.e. territories, SDR/AE alignment, lead qualification parameters, etc.\r\n-Leadership preaches about being radically transparent but actually doesn't divulge much info about internal company decisions"}, {"review_title": "Used to be a great company", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Still great work, one of the best places in NCR to work\r\nGood facilities\r\nReasonable work life balance\r\nGood compensation", "cons": "Not much growth especially for mid-level people\r\nCompany is not growing as much as it used to \r\nBureaucracy at senior levels\r\nSome teams have not so good work, some teams have no visibility, growth depends on luck and hard work"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work in", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Feb 2010", "job_title": " in Beijing, Beijing", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible work time, Work at home allowed.\r\nnew technology, some are very fancy.\r\nManagers are very supportive.  \r\nMany great trainings provided.", "cons": "may take multiple tasks at the same time.
