Managers are fabricating results to cover all these, lying to both BU's(Business Unit) and upper level managers. It takes a while (a year or so) for the BU's to discover the lies, and decommission the models. Many of the models are running with neither internal or external users, wasting company budgets. But \"fortunately\", there are so many BU's and external clients to lie to.(Unlike products on Amazon.com, there is no rating or client reviews.) Upper level managers, on the other hand, welcome lies and keep passing them to even upper level managers, possibly including the CEO. The next step is to pass the lies to the Wall Street and investors, tell them the company is building \"industrial leading models\", and paraphrase every million wasted as \"investment in developing cutting edge AI\". The models have difficulties handling million rows of training data generated quarterly, while people getting similar level of salary in the industry are building, maintaining and designing models handling data of tens of millions of rows daily! \r\n\r\nThere is more than one way to make money, instead of building good products, an ML team can ACT (yes, ACT for actor) as an excellent stock booster. Good ML models are hard to build, it may take months to build and revise the model. While it only takes 4 weeks (after the initial meeting) for a manager to claim \"the model already achieve a QUARTERLY impact of $XX(double digit) million with 'BU approval'\", and the VP, Sr Dir, Dir are all happy and comfortable with this. (BTW, this exact manager once told BU that \"0.33 is not a bad p-value as the model is correct 66% of the time.\" The person lacks either statistical knowledge, or professional integrity, or both. The upper managers recognize this as \"defending the models of the DS/ML team\".)\r\nFor startups, after they fake it they still endeavor to make it; however for this team, they fake it then cash out, RSU and ESPP."}, {"review_title": "Best Place to Work- High quality Work, Strong People Culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Encouraged to take moonshots with high quality projects - Excellent cohort of people to work with - People centric wellness benefits - Strong support from leadership", "cons": "- None.
