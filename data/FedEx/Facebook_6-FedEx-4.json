Unfortunately, the cons outweigh the pros.  If you are thinking that it is a blessing to have a job in this tight economy maybe you will look at the pros.  A sales career is not an ideal position for any college graduate looking to advance with this corporation. Let's look at the pros of a sales career at FedEx.\r\n\r\n1) Flexiability - but this is true of sales professions at many corporations across America.\r\n\r\n2) Stability- If you work for FedEx in a sales role (like UPS), it is highly unlikely that you will be laid-off.  Sales people are revenue driving force in the organization. FedEx and UPS (I have worked for both) recognize this; therefore, it is unlikely you will lose your job due to the economy.\r\n\r\n3) Overall, FedEx has a good insurance package. The dental is not competitive. You can purchase a better dental insurance package from an outside company that offers a better plan and the same cost or a little less.\r\n\r\n4) FedEx is one of the few companies offers their employees a pension. The organization is reinstating the 401K match. It was suspended during the recession.\r\n\r\n5) FedEx does not like to lay-off employees. Unfortunately, the economy has caused some lay-offs. However, FedEx does so when the organization has no other option.  Compared to many companies, layoffs have been very low during the recession.  In this respect, FedEx does care about their employees.", "cons": "Working as a field Account Executive at FedEx is a low-paying thank less job.   The salary would be fair if you were working a 40-45 hour a week job.  If you are going to be an effective sales person by hitting your numbers and closing new business, you will work long hours.  This might not be a problem if you are compensated for your efforts. \r\n\r\nAlso, the job does not really require that an individual work as long if management allowed their employees to manage their time effectively to get the tasks completed to get new packages \u201con the belt.\u201d  There is a lot of administrative work. The FedEx internal systems are low and outdated. If the sales employees were hourly, I am certain that the organization would work on streamlining many of their internal processes to save their employees time and to make the job easier. \r\n\r\nFedEx does not believe that their sales people are intelligent individuals who can make business decisions.  This can be seen by how they manage their people.  Your focus is not just sales.  You are the customer service person for every account in your territory even for account that you do not receive commission for\u2026 FedEx has the practice of giving the Sales Executive cell phone to everyone\u2026 Any person who finds your card will be calling you.  It was ridiculous.  The list of problems with this position goes on and on. \r\n\r\nIf you want to have a life outside of FedEx, do not apply here. If you want to spend time with your family, do not apply here. If you want to spend your evenings watching television while working on FedEx pricing contracts or responding to e-mails almost every night of the week, then this is the JOB for you. \r\n\r\nI do not mind hard work. I was an effective sales person\u2026 BUT PAY ME FOR MY EDUCATION, PROFESSIONALISM, TIME AND EFFORT! This is truly the JOB from HELL!  For those you read this post, I was not a poor performer. I always had good reviews and brought on large accounts.  I attempted to give this company my best during the time I was employed there and make the best of a BAD situation until a new door opened.  It is not worst it!  \r\n\r\nIn addition, to all of these problems, the promotion process is nearly impossible within sales department.  As an account executive, you can only be promoted to a sales executive (which is the same position with a new title). Your pay increases significantly, but the requirements change almost yearly and the company makes it almost impossible to get promoted. There are a very limited number of corporate and worldwide account manager positions. People who have those positions rarely resign or quit. When one becomes available everyone is trying\u2026 promotion regardless of work ethic is nearly impossible.  UPS promotes their people fairly; FedEx does not. I have worked for both\u2026 At UPS, I was respected and treated like the educated individual that I am. At FedEx, I was a robot without a brain."}, {"review_title": "Package Handler", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Handler and Courier in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "For part time employees you have hours that you are assigned and are not required to work more than those hours.

It's not a comfortable living, but you can pay your bills on the base pay, which is nice.\r\n\r\nIf you want a career in sales and are willing to move, this is a good starting point.

No overtime, no staying late... just carry the stress home with you and let it bubble overnight.", "cons": "Career opportunities outside of sales are nearly nonexistent, despite what management will say in your interview. People can move out of sales if they're creative in finding ways to network, which management in the sales office will not be very helpful with.\r\nThe path to move up is through field sales. If you're unable to move, or don't want to stay in sales, the best of luck to you.\r\n\r\nWhile the hourly pay is livable, you're unlikely to receive the bonus checks you hear about in the offer letter. 80% of the Dallas office does not bonus for the quarter. It's not a question of work ethic. FedEx is struggling as a company, and it's a very difficult market to be competitive in. Whether or not your territory has potential is luck of the draw.\r\n\r\nSince FedEx is doing so poorly right now globally, upper management has put all of its efforts into straining the sales team to do more, constantly. The difficulty of this is exacerbated by the antiquated internal systems that take minutes to hours to struggle through for things like pricing proposals.\r\n\r\nThe number of sales calls you're expected to make continues to grow to ever more unrealistic levels. While it's possible to make all the calls, emails, and sales opportunities that are expected of you each day, it's unsustainable. I've cycled through my list of customers, some more than once over, in the last month because I'm constantly trying to reach the daily call metric.\r\n\r\nIf dialing the phone were your only responsibility, it might make sense, but you're also expected to draft pricing proposals and present them to close business. If you spend an hour researching and drafting pricing, and then you spend another hour presenting it, this counts as one sales call in your daily metrics.\r\nAccording to management, at this point, you've had an extremely unproductive day with your one measly call. Whether or not your time is spent growing revenue is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nWith such an emphasis on arbitrary daily metrics, there isn't much opportunity to actually do the job you're hired to do, which would be closing business.\r\nAll this said, I haven't mentioned how much time it can take to help resolve customer issues. You're constantly told by management to let customer service handle complaints and issues- your job is to sell. Fair enough, but customer service seems to be trained to send customers to their account executive when they aren't sure how to handle something. \r\n\r\nThis means that any time you spend not working toward your daily metrics counts as not working. If you're fixing something for a customer, working to create revenue for a company by making proposals, or doing something as important as assisting a teammate with a problem, you are wasting your time in the eyes of management.\r\n\r\nThere's not enough time in a work day, and there's not enough resources to do the job. All of the complaints I've listed have been discussed with varying levels of management, and are consistently discarded as a personal problem with time management.\r\n\r\nTLDR: you're expected to constantly do more, your efforts are hardly appreciated, and when you try to make suggestions for improvement, you're ignored. You feel undervalued as a FedEx employee during these times. The company is struggling, and is trying to get every bit of mileage out of you it can.\r\n\r\nI would only recommend this job to someone who lives and breathes selling.

Several years ago Fedex Trade Networks did this but now they do not anymore due to their goal of ORGANIC growth. I.E. encourage hard work in employees, pay them low wages, grow the company and pad corporate executives pockets with bonuses and stock options.

No decorations.  The work experience is a drudgery grind.\r\n\r\nAnd this would be fine, if employees were allowed to engage in periodic distraction.  A glance at something on the web now and then is enough to keep the brain awake.  Consider also that you're given hard metrics on productivity, so it really shouldn't be a problem if you stay within them.\r\n\r\nBut no distractions of any kind are officially permissible except for listening to music through headphones.  Doing absolutely anything else with your time while in the office provokes politics.  You could produce the highest numbers in the office and then get in trouble for being unproductive for 10 minutes - not exaggeration, this literally happened.\r\n\r\nThe regional manager is also horribly obsessive-compulsive - once demanding that my co-worker put his monitor in the same position on his desk as everyone else on the cubicle block, even though doing so aggravated his carpal tunnel.  \r\n\r\nThe politics are ridiculous.  Favoritism runs deep and rampant.  Upper management will create rules just to bully and micromanage certain employees they don't like, while nothing is enforced on others.  Most of the favorites were people who were barely productive, and spent most of their time trying to get productive employees in trouble for sport.  And the excessively detailed rules created the perfect environment for bullying to take place.\r\n\r\nThere was one clique in particular who produced the lowest numbers in the office, worked several hours of overtime every day even during periods where anybody else would get written up for clocking out 1 minute past 8 hours, and they would pick on people relentlessly.  They would rotate targets for harassment, and take turns walking past their target's desk periodically to see what they were doing.  If it was anything other than focusing exclusively on work, they would immediately complain, and that person would get written up.  This was an ongoing state of affairs for all 7 years I worked in that office.\r\n\r\nAlso, any communication regarding pay or the value of your work from corporate was always extremely insulting.  Best example:  there is a fundraising drive every year for United Way.  Every year they show a promotional video.  One year, they had one of the company's top executives introduce the video by saying \"We're all feeling the effects of the economic recession\", while wearing his immaculate suit and politician's smile.  They then proceeded to show a little documentary bit about how *one of our own co-workers* didn't make enough money to take care of her kid, and how United Way helped her to make ends meet.

Not much standardization for the sales force i.e., a type of sink or swim environment with tools flying at us that are not properly tested before we get them.  These take up time we dont have but are required to use, only to have the next new thing be dumped on us a few weeks later.  It is like a contest to see who can make a name for themselves by coming up with a new technique and after that we have to work out the bugs.  By that time, another tool or training will be required.      We supposedly are given warm leads, but approx 40% of the spreadsheet are companies out of business, havent shipped in over 10 years, etc.  To close the sale we have to use a process, which means if a customer wants to ship with us the same day we call, we cannot close it unless we have a minimum of 3 calls.  AND we have to move the sale through a \"certainty' rating, which means  we have to log the close as 25% sure, then 50% sure, then 75%, 90% then close it.   Many dont do it this way and just make sure they have the minimum 3 calls.  No one seems to believe that an inside sasales professional can know if the customer is wanting to ship in one or 2 calls.  Also, we now have a phone system that allows management to listen to our calls so there is the Big Brother aspect.  \r\n\r\nManagers play favorites and there is no recourse to this as the manager network is tight.  I.e., it would do no good to report one as blatantly applying the rules according to their personal preferences vs. what is fair and equitable.  \r\n\r\nThe sales job requires a minutia of extraneous tasks in additional to actual selling.  The systems we have are not user friendly and it requires using 4-5 places to find all the information necessary to track our calls, pull up information about the customer and track the customer's shipping for closes.  There is a lag time to seeing how a customer is shipping, we have to wait 1-2 days to get pricing approved for them, etc.  And after we bring on an account and grow it, we then have to give it to the field sales reps who usually have not done a single thing to work the account.  Any objections will be answered with:  \"It's the right thing for the customer.\"   Everyone in sales knows this is an untruth.   The other thing about field sales is FedEx seems to have a preference for hiring outside for field and had no problem hiring 70 layed off DHL reps which took promotional opportunities away from internal employees.    Speaking of promotional opportunities, \r\npromotional opportunities are largely dependent on the relationship with your manager.

What happens in the Company makes their plan, the EVPs divided it up (leaving a little in their back pockets)... then the RVPs hang on to a little extra... then the division guys do it, too so eventually the stations end up with FTE goals that are impossible to hit.

It is a division of customer service - but is not customer service.  So you don't even get the nice friendly calls to inquire about services or rates.  You only get the upset customers from calls that have been escalated.  (And the calls are back-to-back ... And you better be on \"available\" or you have to write an explanation as to why you are not taking calls.) You understand that is part of the job - it is what it is.  However, most of the co-workers are very unprofessional with a fierce, petty, ghetto attitude. Many of them have grown up together and go to the same church and/or live close to each other.  So it is very cliquey. If the non-stop irate calls and the co-workers are not stressful enough, you get no support from the managers.  In fact, they might say they have an open door policy - but that does not mean they are actually willing to listen to any of your concerns or helpful suggestions ... Lest you have a complaint.  They will only preach to you the corporate policies to make you get \"on-board\" with the program.  Once I had a problem with a manager that kept bullying me.  I mean a manager that treated me like a kindergartner and told me to do things because \"she said so\".  When I approached the Sr. Mgr. with my concerns, the response was \"Let's use this as a coaching opportunity for you\".  In other words, the complaint will get nowhere.  So I better shut up and take it.  I realize now the mentality of a large corporation and how management is only there to back each other up.  It's such a shame as I was a hard-working employee that tried to do my best to keep up with the high call volume and consistently be empathetic and helpful to the customers that were in an awful predicament without the delivery of their package.  Other departments at FedEx might be great.  But this particular department has only gone downhill.  It is a nasty cut-throat abusive environment. They expect Trace Reps to be the customer's advocate.  But the management is not there to be the Trace Agent's advocate.  The job is terrible and is always in a \"crisis\" mode with your taking a beating for FedEx on almost every call.  Yes, that is understood that is what you signed up for.  But the job could be so much more tolerable with sympathetic and supportive managers and less Corporate politics and the ever growing rules that add more burden than assistance to the job/employee itself.
