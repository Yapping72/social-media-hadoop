You're there to help all the designers, but then certain designers don't want your help and only look for certain Assistants to help them which means that you never get to learn how to do certain tasks (you help Graphic Designers and Structural Designers in this role), then suddenly when that assistant isn't available to them, they get annoyed with you when you were never shown how to complete a particular task. There is very little opportunity for growth as well. You'd be lucky if they hired you full- time within 2 years. I've seen two lay-offs happen while there. The layoffs are a result of it being a large company and not due to the managers. The company constantly monitors employee output, so they lay people off yearly to give it a scrub.

However, the pay would be decent if you had a standard 40-45 hour work week. The expectation is to work 10 hours a day. They can\u2019t say this, but if you work less than you will be devalued in your yearly review and told you aren\u2019t helping the team. If there are 10 people working on troubleshooting, and you are about to walk out the door you are either faced with 1) stay and work 16 hours and be back in 8 hours, or 2) be devalued because you didn\u2019t stay to help. Management isn\u2019t even concerned about having tired management. Whatever pay is offered, take off 30% of your hourly earnings because an 8 hour day is not possible.\n\nWork-Life Balance: Not recommended if you have a family, friends or any sort of social life. They are workaholics here. It\u2019s expected that you are on call at all times. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve worked 16 hours, you are expected to answer calls and come in 8 hours later. Working more than 16 hours is nothing to be proud about and the way people in management brag about working 22 hours is saying \u201cbe there or you are not helping the team.\u201d I started with a group of 5 other engineers and those 5 left before me after 2.5 years. \n\nCareer Development: There are many benefits in the pros. Just know that interns get the same trainings offered to you. They'll get things such as team building trips to the theme park and get paid for it. The sad part is that they'll get overtime for doing practically nothing. \n\nCommunication: I hope you like being talked down to and be treated like you don\u2019t know anything in your area of expertise. Lots of people here can never be wrong.\n\nMicro-Management: Not everyone in management is a micro-manager but this comes from the top. This company doesn\u2019t care how much experience you have. They will monitor projects at every step and correct your mistakes. However, if you go by the correction and it doesn't answer the issue several months down the road, the blame will be placed on you. Upper management here does not think they micromanage but they do. They constantly question you for every decision you make. Be ready to know how to answer the 20 questions. Just know that you are not being devalued (at least not yet), it's just the expectation of management to micromanage and answer the 20 questions coming from above.\n\nDecision-making from long term employees: They do not value data that comes off the DCS that you collect.

People generally stay there for quite a long time (older employees were offered a pension which I think has helped with the tremendous employee retention). The people there tend to be friendly, competent, and dedicated to doing the best work they can do for their clients, which is rare and refreshing. People there really seem to care about what they are doing. The Norcross campus is about a half mile from downtown Norcross, which offers lots of lunch choices and a pleasant place to walk if you have the chance to get out during lunchtime. Unlike a lot of other companies, it's not a madhouse trying to get in and out of the parking lot at the end of the day. In the Norcross campus, most people have HUGE offices and plenty of space, which helps keep people from getting sick at work. At least in my department, the work pace is very manageable and rarely stressful.  It's rare that I work late nights or weekends.  The company has made huge jumps in growth in the past 8 years, first buying Smurfit Stone in 2011, then merging with MeadWestvaco to become the second biggest packaging manufacturers in the country.  The work is interesting, and can even be fun and rewarding.", "cons": "Shareholder value is the overwhelming focus at the company, which means that employee incentives, particularly raises, take a backseat to earning money for the board and the shareholders.  While this is not unusual at many businesses, the eventual result is that there is very little incentive for most employees to work harder, learn new things, take on new responsibilities, etc. The pay is not exceptional, from what I understand it is moderate to low.  We do get yearly raises, but generally the average is probably around 2.5%. Don't think you can lowball offer your way into the company and then get a significantly better salary after you've proven yourself. Despite expanding my position's responsibilities significantly, adjusted for inflation, I only make slightly more than the day I was hired.  As far as I can tell there is no way around this wall, people say that the low raises are HR policy that is independent of employee achievement. This, coupled with the long tenure of many older employees, means that it is hard to advance and easy to stagnate there.  You may have a pleasant work life and a good boss, but you'll never get promoted or get a raise unless someone just decides to quit (which rarely happens because of the pension) gets fired (which also rarely happens) or retires. \r\n\r\nThe health benefits packaging started off fairly standard but it gets worse every year.  As it stands now there is only one plan choice with a deductible of several thousand dollars that has to be paid yearly before anything else is covered (apart from preventative physicals and such). Great if you shatter your femur, not so much if you have bronchitis or sprain your ankle.  The company does offer an HSA that they'll contribute to as a way to help offset the cost of the deductible, so that does help a little. \r\n\r\nThe retirement plan has a good match (it actually increased a point after the merger) but they've changed where it is held three times in the last five years, which means you don't always have a lot of choice of the funds you'd like to put into your retirement account.         \r\n\r\nCompared with companies that my peers work for, WestRock's benefits and vacation time are quite low.  2 weeks vacation only for the first 5 years, then 3 weeks years 5-12, 4 weeks 12-18, etc. When I was first hired the 20 days of vacation mark was at year 10, but recently they have been quietly moving it up a few years, presumably as a cost cutting measure in the hopes that people will leave before they reach that point. It's a little disheartening, I think if you've been with a company a decade you should get (and need) more vacation time than that.    \r\n\r\nThe company offers no maternity leave, no on site gym, no daycare.  The feeling I get is that the company is still very much in the old school mode of \"shouldn't your wife be handling that?\" when it comes to child care. The company conducts random drug tests at all levels, not only for a prescreen, but at any time.
