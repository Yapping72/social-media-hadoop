This, paired with slow and painful changes makes the day-to-day a draining and unfulfilling experience -Promotions seem very slow and unlikely given the poor financial performance of the organization (the financial opinion shared here is based off public-facing information and stock performance). -Lots of chaos over the entire 2 years and 4 months I was there.

Upper D-level management is not willing to listen to suggestions for improvement. They are severely lacking in their IT department, refusing the use of new software or tools that would be nice to have (hard no, even on free applications). The \"technology\" that is used is so outdated, and the reliance on complicated Excel sheets instead of business intelligence tools is absurd. Some of the management I've worked with aren't looking to try and make improvements, declining any suggestions. Communication with upper management is challenging, given their packed schedules - they don't return emails or calls but expect work to be done (and work that requires their input). Departments don't interact with each other, and communication between them gets messy; you often need to make several attempts to get an answer and there is no direct point of contact. Outlined objectives are rarely worked on, leaving departments to be reactive instead of proactive, always \"putting out the fire\" instead of improving work flow and methods. Despite the generous vacation time, it's hard to actually book more than 1-2 days off at a time because there's so much work to be done and one missed day causes huge impacts and delays. Management doesn't seem to like someone calling in sick, even in an emergency (with a medical note). Everything just moves very slowly, even though everyone is busy (probably because the delays in senior management). There are also SO many meetings that prevent people from getting work done - I manage several calendars and people have been booked for 30+ hours of meetings in one week, leading to \"mandatory\" overtime as people have work that needs to get done."}], [{"review_title": "Used to be great", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "19 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Conversion Press Maintainer in Golden, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Hourly wage and pension plan", "cons": "Zero work/life balance culture if intimidation and threats rampant cronyism"}, {"review_title": "Excellent Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Site EHS Manager in Waterford", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits and respectful of people", "cons": "Have not found them yet"}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "18 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Process Superintendent in Goodyear, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, competitive pay, great values, safety oriented, stock purchase options, full pension after 5 years. 2 weeks vacation on start date.", "cons": "Long hours, plant is new and lacks experience needed.
