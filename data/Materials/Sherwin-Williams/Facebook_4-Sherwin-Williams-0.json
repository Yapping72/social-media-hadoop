As mentioned before, there are many opportunities that exist within the company but there might be a good chance that they won't be around your location. If nothing is keeping you from moving to those locations (college grad & single, etc) then it might be something to look in to. But if you do (life obligations , family,etc) then this can be a problem. -Support. Stores can often times be understaffed and will limit one's ability to perform the duties they need to carry out. This will vary on store location and type, like a commercial paint store, automotive paint, floorcovering, etc. Each location will have their busy times but it can be very overwhelming if there isn't enough bodies in the store to help. This leads to the next point.... -Work/Life balance. When there isn't enough people to staff a store, as a store/assist./operations manager, it is up to you to pick up the slack. Challenges can range from helping walk-in customers, inventory cycle counts & auditing, customer account management, taking customer phone calls (placing orders, issues with an order, asking for product info, checking stock on a product, etc.). The list of things to do can be endless and the most important thing is that it has to be done, no matter what. This can require having to stay late after closing and even very early mornings before opening and this includes weekends too. -Turnover. The employee turnover rate is quite high in this company. This mostly applies to store management positions because they are required to work overtime hours well past 40 hours. There are some managers who have worked well in to the 60 hour range if not more.

The customer to manager and rep relationships have gone out the door because there are new reps and managers every two years now. \nIt is really SAD where this company is heading. I actually loved working for them, but upper management has really screwed up how they are running the company in the last two years. Between covid and insane product shortages, there is a lot of disgruntled employees. Most of those employees won't leave because of benefits and the job security that Sherwin gives a person. It might be one of the hardest companies to get fired from.... As a store manager, you better make sure you think a candidate is qualified before hiring them because otherwise that person will be with the company until they want to quit because there are so many loopholes to jump through to fire an employee (which is good, but also can be bad)."}, {"review_title": "Meh", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Keyholder in Hamilton, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Meet cool people, learn new things", "cons": "Under value, under paid.

bad for leaving your coworker alone.\nManagement was lazy and expected the MTP (me) work more than management (even tho I don't get bonus'd from working my butt off for their store).\nCorporate doesn't care... they're so greedy that they clearly see the employees drowning and they don't do anything to alleviate the pain.\nI deeply regreted accepting this job...
