It gets really embarrassing, too, when the driver notices I'm following him and we then proceed to have the world's most unexciting and pathetic car chase. This is so ridiculous. I should be in my store, managing my store. You know what else I love? I love trying to sell mid-grade level paint to a DIY for 50 dollars per gallon. When they look at me completely astonished, I'm supposed to say, \"Oh, don't worry, we can set you up a preferred account and you'll get 10% off..... 10% off of 50 dollars.... so you'll only have to pay 45 dollars... WHAT A DEAL!!! I love getting stared at like I have horns.
