The work can be physically tiring on days when you are moving lots of items around.\r\n2. This one was just a personal issue but for a long period of time I have been without a touch pad because of an apparent chip shortage. This meant that finding my loads can be a hassle; it required me to communicate with dispatch over the phone to ask for loads. Sometimes dispatch may not know what you are picking up which requires you to communicate with the respective store to find out what it is.\r\n3. There are times that inadequate training is provided due to the stores being busy. I had to learn from trial and error of using a hand driven forklift as well as learning how to properly secure loads. \r\n4. Understaffing in the store might mean you have to work awkward hours sometimes. \r\n5. Some deliveries might force you to go overtime without prior notice. \r\n6. I had to wait several months before I even got my company shirts! \r\n7. Dealing with other bad drivers on the road can be stressful to deal with at times.\r\n8. Be prepared to get paint on your nice clothes! I would highly recommend purchasing clothes from a Goodwill or Salvation Army store to get your clothes for a cheaper price so you don\u2019t have to worry so much about ruining your nice clothing. I\u2019ve gone through at least three pairs of pants and a couple of shirts so far.\r\n9. Some of the customers can be very demanding.\r\n10. Finding new residential houses can be very difficult if builders boards are not present on the job sites. This is no fault of the stores (sometimes), but it can be very time consuming if you\u2019re unprepared. \r\n*Ask your manager to provide you with a layout of the neighborhood. \r\n11. Some deliveries might require you to traverse hills, soft sand, or even mud while carrying paint buckets weighing anywhere between 50 and 75 pounds.\r\n12.

They tell you not to mix paint, but Lowes will often short staffing, pull them to cover another department, or not even bother to schedule anyone. That's just retail. Nope, that's just Lowes. Paint isn't self serve, you can't just jump back their and mix it yourself, but Lowes doesn't know that or doesn't care. Covid has only magnified the problem. My issue isn't that Lowes doesn't care as much as SW doesn't care either. No associate, no problem, just sell them something. Now just go and convince your managers it's in their best interest to actually staff a department. Paint is less than 10% of a stores business, so it can be difficult to get traction with Store mgmt. \n\nIf I bring over a contractor and convert them to our paint and then they go into a store and have to wait 10 minutes for someone to be found that can mix paint. It doesn't really help. Why wait in a store that couldn't care less that my time is being wasted when I can go to a paint store and get treated like a king.

You have to go from assistant to manager to manager at a bigger store to sales rep because that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been. \n\nCompensation. Trash.

Even if you do an assistant can look at being over quota by 40k and think they\u2019re going to get a good bonus check because they killed it. They would be wrong.
