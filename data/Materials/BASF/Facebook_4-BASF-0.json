has put in place several functions to adress equality and cooperative behavior but they still face a massive problem with sexism in the workplace. Overall, the company's committment at the time of writing this review is based rather on words and not on sufficient action to tackle these inequalities. In many departments, there is little sensitivity towards these issues and a lack of training of employees to become more aware of their working environment. Controversy and discussion are not an integrated element of corporate culture, neither is there a culture for failure. Hierarchies are steep which makes communication exhausting. It is difficult to pursue a career as an outsider, senior management usually has spent decades within the company. There is insufficient promotion of an empathic leadership culture with managers too often being promoted based on tenure rather than on leadership skills. Flexibility and control exercised through senior management vary from department to department with parts of the company being hybrid and flexible and others still following an absolute top down-approach."}, {"review_title": "Challenging & Rewarding Work but Toxic Culture and Poor Leadership", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "17 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Marketing Manager in Florham Park, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of projects to work on, providing many opportunities for growth (if you can navigate the system).

Had to borrow money in order to pay my rent. Despite the fact that I told them, they didn't care too much about the urgency of the matter neither. The managers do not have managment skills and always act to defend their own interests instead of the ones of the team. Never happened to me before. They also adopt the micromanaging model of work. You have to report to them your movements and actions everyday. There are too many meetings that last too long. Which in consequence doesn't leave too much time to work, That is why there are many people in the team, Otherwise the work could be perfectly done with less people. Within the team, there is not really a structure or a good organisation. It is rather chaotic. The job position is also not the one described where you have to analyse and bring on the table your ideas.

Pathetic work culture on the site, cannot compare it with the work culture at head office/corporate offices. No mutual respect for team members. Only money matters for people working here.\n\n2. People working at the site are locales/regional. So, they talk in their regional language and they don't care whether an outsider understands what they speak which is the worst nature of professionalism.\n\n3. Colleagues at the site will interfere a lot with your personal life and it is not at all suitable for someone who has an introverted personality.\n\n4. Work location is very isolated (Mangalore/Dahej), so local people are highly conservative and they don't allow you to practice city culture. No girl/boy allowed to visit boys/girls house, else society will take action against you and ask you to empty their room.\n\n5. Local people are highly hesitant to give a room for rent to Bachelor's/married people not living with their wife. So, finding a room is hell of a task for a bachelor. Broker's take advantage of this and they charge higher to Bachelor's. Company also doesn't provide accomodation, so very difficult to find a home for someone from outside the city.\n\n6. Living away from family in a place like Mangalore/Dahej can be very lonely and if you don't have colleague's/friends of your own age, it will be very difficult to survive considering that there is no place to hangout (malls, cafe, beaches, tourist attractions, etc)\n\n7. No public transport, no Ola/Uber, no rental services, desolated railway station means that transport system is not at all good and it will make your travelling hell.\n\n8. Site is located far away from City, so if you decide to live in a city, there will be 3-4 hour travelling everyday. Overall 13-14 hours of the day will go in job and no life after job. No employee accomodation provided by the company.\n\n9. Working in Shifts means you will have no sleep cycle and health issues due to lack/excess of sleep.\n\n10. Whatever things you learn in Chemical Engineering in UG, it will be of no use to you. There is no need of Chemical Engineering Knowledge at these sites. People with Diploma can handle the plant functioning best.\n\n11. No professional growth, though your technical knowledge will grow. If you want to move to other job functions, this role is not meant for you. People who are in this role are mainly there beacuse of either their love for Production or lack of opportunities in other roles.\n\n12. Production role is highly monotonous, it involves exposure to same things in work everyday. 8-hour shifts is what you need to do. Nothing new happens and this can be very boring for someone who loves challenges/new experiences from work life."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 May 2022", "job_title": "Mechanical Engineer in Amherst, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing community and room for growth.", "cons": "I can't say that there are any."}, {"review_title": "Bad colleagues in a Good company", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Process Engineer in Seoul", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "BASF, itself was great.\r\nOutstanding when it comes to \r\nProduct competitiveness, Brand Value, ESG and etc.", "cons": "Simply and to be honest, \r\nSolid employment shall be cherished but it's not for all.
