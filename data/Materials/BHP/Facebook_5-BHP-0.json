Partly due to greed for the high salary as covid had just hit and there were not too many opportunities out there and partly out of not believing BHP could be as bad as everyone within the industry says. \r\n\r\nWell, it is. In fact, it is far worse. \r\nBHP is without a doubt the most toxic company culture you can possibly imagine. \r\n\r\nThe company protects bullies and bullying is rife throughout the company, which BHP try and sweep under the carpet. \r\n\r\nThe whole internal ethics point system is fundamentally flawed to protect bullies and perpetrators. Managers can say absolutely anything they want to you in a private meeting because they know they will never face any consequences. Because you have no witness, your statement will never be believed. It\u2019s not okay. The minute you speak up at BHP, you will have a target on your back.\r\n\r\n There is no \u201csafe to speak up\u201d culture. You will be \u201cmanaged out\u201d. Harrassment and bullying occur inside and outside the workplace. \r\n\r\nThe ethics point system is not independent what so ever as BHP try and make the public believe. The ethics team work for - guess who - BHP. They only run the interviews and then the BHP line leaders make the determinations. A fundamental failure in the process and how the bullies are always protected. If your line leaders are your friends there is no way you\u2019re getting disciplined. Flawed from the outset.\r\n\r\n Even the most socially unacceptable and immoral behaviour is deemed not a \u201ccode of conduct breach\u201d and therefore no disciplinary actions are taken, if your line leader likes you. However, if your line leader does not like you, you will be bullied out and be disciplined for the smallest of things so watch out. \r\n\r\nManagers do not follow their own company policies and procedures but face no consequences. You will then be threatened with termination if you speak to anyone else about what the bullies have done.\r\n\r\nBHP try far too hard in the media to portray a culture of care, a safe place to work and a great company. Any company who has to spend thousands trying to convince the public they are so great is doing so because they are trying to cover up their bad reputation. And they have one of the worst reputations within the resource industry for a very good reason. \r\n\r\nAsk any previous employee of BHP and they will all tell you the same. Read the reviews here - toxic, bullies, no culture of care - all say the same thing. Two seperate interviews with other companies and the comments received were \u201cyou don\u2019t even have to tell us why you\u2019re leaving BHP\u201d and \u201cYes, unfortunately I also used to work for BHP. I was smarter than you though. I got out of there as quick as I could within a year. So trust me, I know why you\u2019re leaving too\u201d. \r\n\r\nNo amount of media campaigns will ever cover this up. No amount of media marketing on culture of care can pull the wool over peoples eyes. No amount of media marketing will ever cover up BHPs real reputation which is terrible. BHP appoint females into roles they do not hold required qualifications for. Then they try and hit you with the spiel \u201cdiverse teams are safer\u201d. No sorry BHP. Competent teams are safer. Not unqualified people regardless of their gender. \r\n\r\nThey do not provide safe places of work but you can\u2019t speak up because you will be managed out. No training, no development and no career opportunities. If you\u2019re male don\u2019t even bother applying for a job. \r\n\r\nCamp accomodation is dirty and very unhygienic. I\u2019ve stayed in my fair share of camp accomodation and BHP only clean rooms every 8 days and you have to hot seat your room. Management are shockingly useless. They make no positive impact on the company at all. The toxic culture stems from the top down. I have witnessed shocking treatment at BHP - I really don\u2019t know how management sleep at night knowing what they are covering up. \r\n\r\nSure, BHP have cranked down on sexual harassment, but only since the Rio Tinto report and a WA parliamentary enquiry have been made public. If all ex BHP employees who were subjected to the bullying made their experiences public , BHP would be ruined. If BHP are such a great company and provide the culture of care they are trying to portray in the media, then why don\u2019t they release a report just like Rio Tinto did? Simply, because they would be ruined. \r\n\r\nShareholders deserve to know the real BHP. Toxic. B- bullies. Full of them. H - hypocrites. 200% not the company they try to portray in the media. There is no culture of care, only for bullies. They do not walk the talk on mental health. P - pernicious and profane. \r\n\r\nUnethical and very harmful company. Their culture is socially, ethically and morally unacceptable. No health insurance provided which is pretty standard in this industry. Seriously, the only perk to working at BHP is the salary. And yes, it is high for a reason. Seriously, do not work here if you value your wellbeing and ethics.
