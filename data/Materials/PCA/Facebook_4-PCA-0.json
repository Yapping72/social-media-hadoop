PCA is all about the customer but to the detriment of the employees. It was supposed to be 8 hour shifts but the last 4 years was 12 hours because they couldn't/ wouldn't hire anyone.

We're growing and our products are in high demand so there are plenty of overtime opportunities. We don't have layoffs and we're always looking for new employees.\n\nPlease understand, this is hard work that requires a personal commitment to working long hours (sometimes up to 12 hour shifts) depending on staffing shortages or customer demand. The upside is you can provide a very stable living for yourself and your family. The 401K and benefits are outstanding. Some weeks, I have to work 6 days a week (Mon- Sat) and a swing shift (1st/ 2nd) is a requirement unless you're willing to work 3rd. I enjoy working with 97% of my co-workers. The 97% understand what is required of them; 1) show up to work 2) put forth an honest day's work for an honest day's pay 3) show a willingness to learn and work in a team environment 4) keep your whining and complaining to a minimum. The 3% usually take care of themselves and end up being terminated, but it's the 3% that can make it a miserable work day for the other 97% who are counting on the 3% to still do their show up and do their jobs.\n\nEach of us (the 97%) who have the drive and initiative will bend over backwards to help you succeed if you willing to fully accept the 4 requirements mentioned above. I consider some of my colleagues and coworkers as my extended family. I haven't felt this way working for other employers, but the offsetting downside is you do have to work alot. If you have a deep seated aversion to working, you will hands-down will not work out here. You will not make it more than 60 days (your probationary period).\n\nThis is a very candid and honest assessment; if you're struggling with requirements 1-3, please flat out don't work with us. We're willing to overlook requirement #4 (complaining) as this will dissipate when you see the overwhelming support you'll get with the appearance you're committed to working here. I cannot speak that every PCA plant operates the same, but it's the people, the \"right people,\" that clearly make the difference. Middletown was named Turnaround Plant of the Year\" 2 years ago pre-Covid. What won it? The \"right people\" committed to winning. We're back trending in the right direction in '21 and early '22. We just need more winning attitudes and folks willing to come in to work.",

Your moved around daily which is fine but not long enough to learn anything. Evrytime you move you have very limited time to catch on to anything as every time your moved around. While your watching and paying attention to try and learn their process your looked at as standing around and exspected to push a broom around. Not a problem to push a broom around. But if your trying to learn, how are you gonna learn anything from cleaning house. As I  was working in an assigned area I had an issue with a piece if equipment. I asked a supervisor to help with my issue. The supervisor had no clue on how to remedy the problem I had with the machine. All he did was complain about how we need to keep going. Made it thru that day. Following week moved to another area and learn another area of company. Even worse... Understaffed for the work. The equipment does not work properly and they expect you to keep up. I could go on and on. I just feel it good to warn anyone if they want to try working for them... seriously I'd try and find another company"

Saw too many people with years of experience get passed over for a supervisors buddy. Sad when employees are teaching management on operations of machines. Useless because when you need help and they dont know they blame you for not knowing how to fix the problem and repremand you for not keeping up with expectations. Also safety is preached but overlooked when production is behind. Saw many instances where shortcuts were allowed untill someone got hurt then let go for safety violation.management degrade and harass you to get numbers up but not much is done to help out. Several years ago moral was so bad and accident were on the rise due to employees not being appreciated that they did a full sweep from the top down. Life was good and pride was back but now the same situation. Needs to be wiped out again or history will repeat itself."

If an employee reaches out to hr for support/help with local leadership, HR usually informs leadership that an disgruntled employee reached out and informs leadership what was said by the employee.

We're growing and our products are in high demand so there are plenty of overtime opportunities. We don't have layoffs and we're always looking for new employees.\n\nPlease understand, this is hard work that requires a personal commitment to working long hours (sometimes up to 12 hour shifts) depending on staffing shortages or customer demand. The upside is you can provide a very stable living for yourself and your family. The 401K and benefits are outstanding. Some weeks, I have to work 6 days a week (Mon- Sat) and a swing shift (1st/ 2nd) is a requirement unless you're willing to work 3rd. I enjoy working with 97% of my co-workers. The 97% understand what is required of them; 1) show up to work 2) put forth an honest day's work for an honest day's pay 3) show a willingness to learn and work in a team environment 4) keep your whining and complaining to a minimum. The 3% usually take care of themselves and end up being terminated, but it's the 3% that can make it a miserable work day for the other 97% who are counting on the 3% to still do their show up and do their jobs.\n\nEach of us (the 97%) who have the drive and initiative will bend over backwards to help you succeed if you willing to fully accept the 4 requirements mentioned above. I consider some of my colleagues and coworkers as my extended family. I haven't felt this way working for other employers, but the offsetting downside is you do have to work alot. If you have a deep seated aversion to working, you will hands-down will not work out here. You will not make it more than 60 days (your probationary period).\n\nThis is a very candid and honest assessment; if you're struggling with requirements 1-3, please flat out don't work with us. We're willing to overlook requirement #4 (complaining) as this will dissipate when you see the overwhelming support you'll get with the appearance you're committed to working here. I cannot speak that every PCA plant operates the same, but it's the people, the \"right people,\" that clearly make the difference. Middletown was named Turnaround Plant of the Year\" 2 years ago pre-Covid. What won it? The \"right people\" committed to winning. We're back trending in the right direction in '21 and early '22. We just need more winning attitudes and folks willing to come in to work.",

While your watching and paying attention to try and learn their process your looked at as standing around and exspected to push a broom around. Not a problem to push a broom around. But if your trying to learn, how are you gonna learn anything from cleaning house. As I  was working in an assigned area I had an issue with a piece if equipment. I asked a supervisor to help with my issue. The supervisor had no clue on how to remedy the problem I had with the machine. All he did was complain about how we need to keep going. Made it thru that day. Following week moved to another area and learn another area of company. Even worse... Understaffed for the work. The equipment does not work properly and they expect you to keep up. I could go on and on. I just feel it good to warn anyone if they want to try working for them... seriously I'd try and find another company"

Saw too many people with years of experience get passed over for a supervisors buddy. Sad when employees are teaching management on operations of machines. Useless because when you need help and they dont know they blame you for not knowing how to fix the problem and repremand you for not keeping up with expectations. Also safety is preached but overlooked when production is behind. Saw many instances where shortcuts were allowed untill someone got hurt then let go for safety violation.management degrade and harass you to get numbers up but not much is done to help out. Several years ago moral was so bad and accident were on the rise due to employees not being appreciated that they did a full sweep from the top down. Life was good and pride was back but now the same situation. Needs to be wiped out again or history will repeat itself."

The company prefers hiring candidates with engineering background for salary technical positions but most of the work is actually compliance maintenance because the engineering is already done on the corporate level. This takes away the thrill of wanting to be a subject matter expert in a specific engineering field and that\u2019s why I stated earlier that  it\u2019s a good starting ground but soon you might feel like you\u2019ve hit a ceiling.
