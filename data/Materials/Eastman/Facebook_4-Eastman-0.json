We seem shortsighted in our decisions (or lack thereof). In a very risk averse culture we frequently pass up on opportunities for growth and improvement, and consistently resist investments that don't pay off IMMEDIATELY. A lot of decisions that simply don't make sense. I think this comes along with a switch from management that \"started at the bottom\" within Eastman to external mangers who understand business, but not manufacturing or technical innovation. The qualities that get you promoted are RARELY the qualities that actually make a good manager. Probably as good as any big company, but suffers under the burdens big companies suffer under. I would love to see more drive to achieve and more focus on growth. Another topic, (and I hate to complain because I definitely consider myself an ally) but I don't like the way Eastman is pushing diversity goals right now. It's like it's the only thing that matters, and everyone's too afraid to say anything about it. As a woman in STEM, I absolutely admire the goal of getting more women and engineering in management, however, we go about it SO WRONG. We just decided to not change ANYTHING about the culture, or dig into WHY female engineers leave the company, we just unilaterally made a goal to get gender parity by 2030. Without any other changes, the only way to do this is only hire women (whether they are the most qualified or not) and/or push out men who have done nothing wrong. I wish we would instead improve support for new parents, or offer day care, or adopt flexible WFH policies. All of these would achieve our goals of RETAINING good women, instead of just hiring 90% women with the understanding that most will quit, and ignoring perfectly qualified men. People already grumble about unfair promotions and frankly I'd rather be a minority than equally represented but resented and perceived as unqualified. Finally, Eastman no longer seems to value employees and reward service the way it did in the past. Initial offers are lucrative, but raises are consistently below inflation (3% this year with inflation at 6.5%). This would be fine if the company were suffering, but it's making plenty of money. As an individual handling multi million dollar savings processes but giving up my breakroom coffee because of budget cuts, I am resentful. I truly love the people and community here, but it seems to be leftover from a golden age gone by, and good people (who wanted to spend their lives in Kingsport) are being pushed out."}], [{"review_title": "Caring culture,  great work-life balance, very male centric", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "20 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Group Leader", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The culture is one that does feel like family.

Despite receiving the \"Most Ethical Company\" award several years in a row, there are some shady actions that happen within the company.  There was one particular issue I reported, and after the investigation occurred, I was told \"That's just part of their process.\"  \r\n\r\nThe company doesn't seem to truly value diversity and inclusion.  This issue becomes worse as you move from Senior Management to middle management as well.  Senior Leadership at least recognizes it and says they want to work on it.   A good portion of the middle management (in all fairness, not all) ignores it.  The company took the approach of \"it takes time to change a culture\" when it came to diversity and inclusion, but when the company wanted a change for something that made a quick dollar for the shareholder...let's just say things were happening within a week.   \r\n\r\nPromotions are horrifically slow, unless you are one of the \"chosen\" ones who are placed in special development programs.  They have a list of these \"chosen\" ones for opportunities, and the select people are added pretty quickly after starting with the company.  This brought the diversity issue to the forefront even more; how were they able to pick these \"chosen\" ones without some time to evaluate a person's work?

Hands down some of the most kind, caring, helpful, and intelligent folks I've worked with.  From onboarding, to helping me get up to speed in my job, to coaching, to encouraging me to grow; every single person I've interacted with has been genuinely interested in me and eager to help me contribute the best I can to Eastman, the company they clearly care for.

They know they are Eastman.  With very few exceptions, people here demonstrate and expect Eastman values in the decisions we make, in the way we care for one another, in the products we make, and in the way we're going to get our work done.

We all have jobs to earn and provide for ourselves and our loved ones, and hopefully be fulfilled individually while doing so.  Here again, Eastman appears to me to be as fair as an organization can be about balancing the earnings of employees, the rewards to employees when the company does well, the interests of the shareholders (which many of us are too), capital reserves, and growth.

Depending on the reporting organization there are plenty of meet and greets, public forums, open discussions about activities, a fair amount of clarity regarding growth plans, and expectations. \r\n\r\nManagement works hard to have a very good working relationship with all of the individual contributors. Many of the directors and VPs have luncheons and town halls to share what's going on. There is also a semi-annual corporate town hall where the CEO and senor VPs present the high level vision for the next time period.

There are many benefits to working here, but there are many cons as well.\r\n\r\nThe Meetings: many employees spend so much time in meetings that we barely have time to work.\r\n\r\nSaturday night work: IT employees are expected to perform maintenance type work on Saturday nights. Understandable in a 24x7 environment with little time for downtime, but this is still a con in my view. These Saturday night working take away from quality (and valuable) personal time with friends and family. This takes away from work-life balance. \r\n\r\nOn call: similar to the Saturday night work. IT employees for critical systems are expected to be on call 24x7. Depending on the team this could mean once in a blue moon, every other week, or in some cases I know of employees who are on call 24x7x365 with no relief. This is driven away several very good employees and has some on the breaking point. The people who are in the every other week model are still on call since they are 'backup', which means if the other person doesn't answer right away the backup is called. This takes away from work-life balance. \r\n\r\nNot enough vacation provided for work load during early years. Takes 5 years to accrue 3 weeks vacation and 10 years to accrue 4 weeks. Two weeks does not allow for enough down time to recover from the workload and stay healthy. This solution appears to assume that during the early years you will not have a very much stress.\r\n\r\nFrequent understaffing: many areas are overworked and understaffed. Some groups work overtime every week with no end in sight. This takes away from work-life balance. \r\n\r\nEverything is done the Eastman way. This means that simple solutions become complicated quickly as they are bent to conform to the Eastman way of doing things. Heritage exceptions most be supported forever.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of stress and management tells us that it is just a factor of life in the growth market. The company  keeps growing (Yay!, good thing), buying acquisitions and not increasing staff to cover the work load shift (really bad thing!). Management also does some paper magic to make things appear like they are properly covered, but in reality one person is dedicated to a project while the other is there for backup in name only. 1.25 people assigned to project does not equal 2.\r\n\r\nBenefits keep shrinking.

If you like a short commute and a smaller city atmosphere, Kingsport and the surrounding areas would be a perfect match. However, as Eastman has transitioned to a global presence, the possibilities for travel and assignments in larger cities and many parts of the world are now possible. The work is very challenging.  Lots of opportunity to make contributions for greater success.  Many people will praise the culture and it is good but changing, as Eastman is changing to be an outperforming chemical company.

Those that are selected for advancement to high leadership levels tend to have no children (% of women with 2 or more children at Director and above, does not mirror that of the overall female population at Eastman).\r\nPromotions occur annually and are governed by an Advancement Ladder criteria.  There are many levels which could be used to reward, recognize and engage employees.  However the practical implementation has changed such that a significantly smaller percentage of employees are allowed to occupy the top rungs.  Employees that aren't selected as \"the stars\" that gets to advance past the career rung, become bitter and disengaged. This system is more about who knows and likes you, than what you do.  No doubt, those that reach the highest levels are solid performers but Eastman hires only the best and brightest.  The system leaves many highly contributing, employees parked on the career level rung.\r\nAnother annual practice is the rating of employees.  No one will say the distribution is fixed but at the same time, there must always be people on the left side of the curve.  Each year, if the \"non-performers\" leave, employees with solid contribution and performance have to worry that he/she will be deemed in the lower percentiles during the next annual cycle.

One thing I really like is that compared to many other companies I'm aware of, if you need something, travel, equipment, training, cell phone, whatever, if you can justify it, you're likely to get it.  I have many friends at other companies that have to battle to get the basics they need to do their jobs.  Not here.  People tend to come herre and stay, so there is a huge depth of experience and history with the products and the company, which can help new hires.  Overall, it's tough to find a lot of significant things to complain about in the day to day job, other than the piddly nonsense that you have in any company.  There are some big picture things that can get you down if you let them, which I'll discuss below.  Another thing I like is attention to some of the minor details.  There's 4 gyms at the complex, and they're free to use.  There's multiple credit union branches in the plant, one of which is full-service.  They have several in-plant cafeterias and fast food places, although their fixation on health has been nearing \"neurotic\" levels lately.

Also, it's tougher to advance while waiting for people to retire or expire.  Not the place for you if you're a big city person, or aren't into relaxed, religious southern culture.  Jersey shore types beware! (kidding).  Putting aside all of the \"piddly nonsense\" mentioned above that you find anyplace, the primary problems are intertia.  It takes FOREVER to make decisions.  It's common to be pulled into a high priority job that you bust your butt on to make a tough deadline and then see it sit in an inbox for 6 months to a year.  WAY too many meetings, workgroups and project reviews.  There's also a major disconnect between the upper level management and the rest of us.  The main office complex is about 2 miles from the plant, and in general, people there (building 280) don't tend to leave.  As most have risen to their jobs over a full career here, they feel that since they did your job 20 years ago, they know what's going on now, so they don't need to talk to you about it, or they just talk to your director.  Occasionally this results in something hitting the fan where you have to explain things that happened which the VP's probably should have known about in the first place.  I'm not asking for my hand to be held, but at least show some interest.

The headquarters of Eastman are tucked into a neat community in northeast TN which has wonderful community, great things to do for outdoor-lovers, and also very close to large cities for shopping, arts, etc.", "cons": "Eastman recently moved to a performance based rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as outstanding, exceeds expectation, meets expectations, and does not meet expectations.  This system is quickly killing the morale at the company and the ability for people to work as a team (why help someone else do better at their job if they might be ranked above you because of you helping them?).  Newer/Younger employees seem to be leaving the company either because of lack of morlae, or because the \"grass is greener\" somewhere else.  Eastman has long had an environment of teamwork - and in fact, that is why we have hired the people we have because we are not the \"competetive\" environment that many other companies are.  But with the performance rating system, we are starting to become more cut-throat.  We do not pay the amount that we need to pay for a competitive environment (employees can go elsewhere and make 30-50% more easily).  We need to come back to a culture that works for Eastman, one of teamwork and collaboration.  In addition, the performance based rating system does not work well for an engineering department, where you have many employees contributing at a top level and then coming in as \"meets expectations\" at the end of the year.

Third is the fact that the company actually cares, and does all it can to make everyone a success.

Recent leadership changes over the past decade have helped to retool the culture and it has really started to pay dividends the past few years when it comes to the bottom line and team member morale.  In addition, traditional HR practice was to hire people with engineering degrees FOR EVERYTHING.  Today\u2019s leadership realizes we needed to be more diverse than that and is working to get those with specific expertise (innovation, marketing, project management, etc.)  into those type positions while driving one-track engineers back into engineering roles where they are better suited to excel.   I think that many of the negative reviews you will find on here are from Eastman lifers/aforementioned engineering types who are threatened or have been affected by this culture change because for years it seems the status quo was acceptable.  Those negative on the company\u2019s outlook also contend that Eastman used to be family oriented and that it\u2019s not anymore.  As someone with experience elsewhere, I contend that Eastman has the most family-oriented culture of anywhere I have worked so I guess it\u2019s a matter of perspective.  These negative views are heightened by the fact that current leadership is mostly not from East Tennessee and locals generally have a hard time trusting those not native to the area.  The company trains and compensates team members better than most and best of all \u2013 there is zero tolerance for internal backstabbing.  Finally, the Tri-Cities area with the Blue Ridge mountains and foliage is breathtakingly beautiful and the local people are some of the most genuinely nice and welcoming people you will ever meet.", "cons": "Eastman\u2019s insurance benefits are a disappointment.

So, does our healthcare program match up to the likes of Facebook or Bain?  No, they don\u2019t.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, benefits are not bad but they could certainly be better.  This is the consensus #1 negative you will find on Glassdoor or if you surveyed Eastman team members.  The other con worth mentioning is that it\u2019s hard to get Eastman engineering lifers to think outside of what they have always done.  Since they have been with Eastman for 10, 20, 30+ years, they are extremely adverse to change or looking at things under a different lense.  As I mentioned previously, leadership is working to change this but it\u2019s still something that I would like to see changed quicker as it slows innovation and crushes productivity."}, {"review_title": "Lab Technician, Associate", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "31 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Lab Technician, Associate in Kingsport, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Eastman is a large, global company that functions well in a number of ways.

Eastman seems to have made a habit of placing managers that trained in one department, into an area that's as different as night and day and on the opposite end of the plant, then expecting them to manage a group of people when they themselves have minimal knowledge of how the job its self is actually done. With the implementation of the new healthcare reform act, benefits at Eastman are on the decline.

Eastman enhances these pros with a history of integrity and sound management.\r\n\r\nThe people attracted to a company like Eastman reflect many of the positive aspects of the company. They tend to have caring attitude and they want to do the right things. It seems some of the key elements of the work culture can be traced back to the company's more paternalistic past. As a result, it is easy to find people who will go out of their way to help you on projects. This helping attitude creates a enjoyable work atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe company's work atmosphere is one of team work and cooperation. While there are still areas where silo management and behaviors can be seen, the general attitude seems to be one of trying to cooperate for the overall good of the company. Some of the work atmosphere may be created by the smaller size of the city relative to the relatively large size of Eastman. \r\n\r\nWhile Eastman and its subsidiaries operator in large and small cities around the global, I can best speak to the city that is home to Eastman's headquarters, Kingsport TN. Kingsport is part of a metropolitan area with a population of about 500,000 which includes Bristol TN/Va and Johnson City TN. The people you work with are often your neighbors, their children are schoolmates of your children, and the people you see around town. This smaller town atmosphere likely reenforces the work atmosphere since they people you work with are also members of the same civic clubs, recreational clubs and booster clubs. For some this smaller town atmosphere might be a con rather than a pro, but I think it develops a stronger organizational relationship. It is rare to have such a large and multifaceted employer in a town the size of Kingsport and the broad range of corporate functions based in Kingsport gives rise to a number of challenging career paths.\r\n\r\nWith corporate research, engineering, IT, HR, Supply Chain, and several diverse manufacturing operations in Kingsport, your career path is not limited by one or two functional areas. You can grow and even completely change your career path and never move. In all of these areas you can take pride in knowing that the company is well managed.\r\n\r\nI am a satisfied employee who is benefiting from the work atmosphere that I see as mostly positive.", "cons": "All of the areas that are pros above can make conflict and diversity of thinking difficult to process and deal with. When the organization is stressed it is likely to circle the wagons and lock out dissenters. This can and at times has lead to a hostile atmosphere where management ask for feedback but they do not really want any negative feedback. This can break down into an unpleasant and ineffective workplace.

I have worked at Eastman for almost 10 years and have been very happy the entire time. All my co-workers are top notch.

Pay for business support personnel could be higher for the type of work that they do. In general, annual raises for business support personnel are in the range of 2%.

For instance, when individuals are rated well and receive a nice bonus, it's hard to enjoy because you hear others very upset about their ranking and we are told that people ranked well get their bonus from the people that are not ranked well (take from the \"low\" performers and give to the \"high\" performers). This makes good performers feel a bit guilty, despite how well-deserved the \"high\" ranking is.\r\n\r\nNo Paternity leave, which is critical to the health of our families.

Management squandered everything and all the while telling themselves they were doing a great job. Management was quick to point out your flaws and  rarely praise your successes.
