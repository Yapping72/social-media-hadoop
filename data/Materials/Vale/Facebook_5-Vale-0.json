They are dealing with a massive disaster in Brazil which affected the lives of thousands of people. Senior Management has been scrambling to communicate the \"New Values\" and \"New Leadership Behaviours\" to make things right while continuing to behave in questionable ways. You cannot teach an old dog new tricks! They've been doing things with an autocratic style for so many years that people are terrified to speak up. That's the main cause of the disastrous accident that killed so many people: employees at the frontline not speaking up when they needed to fix things. On the surface they say \"we need to change this culture with the new values\" but they are failing miserably at this because they continue doing exactly the opposite of what they preach. \r\n\r\nManagement is two faced and will only do what benefits them most. While people may seem nice, most of those in managerial positions have an agenda in which you are one of their pawns. Moreover, Senior Management is more focused on rewarding employees from Brazil by offering them managerial roles in Canada, rather than rewarding other more suitable ones who are already in Canada. As an employee, you have very limited to no chances for advancement, whatever your performance might be, unless you speak Portuguese and become friends with your manager. \r\n\r\nMorale is not great due to the declining market conditions resulting in continuous cost-cutting  measures. They have no mercy to fire people who have long tenure and good experience. Even some people who have been hired this year have left due to the lack of training and basic support to do their jobs. Turnover is high in most departments.\r\n\r\nThe worst department I've dealt with was Human Resources. Their Brazilian leaders have no clue about Canadian business culture, practices and regulations. They work things around to suppress the opinions of more knowledgeable Canadian employees. They are the first ones that manage by fear and intimidation. I cannot really call them leaders. What else could I expect of line managers? \r\n\r\nMy manager was also Brazilian and, while seemingly friendly, was totally closed to receiving feedback. She didn't even know how to write a professional email in English. Everything with her was a nice chit-chat but at any point in time the big decisions came in a top-down style and no one could oppose them. I also faced the unfortunate situation that my coworkers were bitter and unresponsive to my communication, so I felt miserable on a daily basis. Only one of the HR reps was sympathetic and listened to me but couldn't help me much due to what I mentioned above.\r\n\r\nTo make things worse, the analysts and specialists spent time dealing with a huge workload that led to mistakes and rework all the time.
