Take a look at the IRS 990 forms and you'll be appalled by the SLT salaries and annual pay raises/bonuses. Agency staff and national non-leadership staff are lucky if they get 2% pay increases in the last few years. Interesting that most of Senior Leadership get way more than that even when business is not doing well. Obviously, their bonus and salary aren't tied to performance and health of the organization. Internally, we are told to cut back, government funding has been cut and we are hurting financially. Leadership pay cuts would definitely help!"}, {"review_title": "Exciting", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Direct Support Associate in Tel Aviv-Yafo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone is like a family, you're helping people with encouragement, mosaic helps provide a different perspective from society, it will help you feel empathy and care for all people, and it's diverse", "cons": "It might be challenging to deal with behaviors, but you learn"}, {"review_title": "dsp", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 May 2021", "job_title": "Direct Support Professional (DSP)", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "being able to play a role in people's lives, building friendships along the way", "cons": "feeling like i am not doing my best that i know i can"}, {"review_title": "Mosaic Orientation", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 May 2021", "job_title": "Direct Support Professional (DSP) in Terre Haute, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I love the hiring team.
