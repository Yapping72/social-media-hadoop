At which point you'll get blamed for never telling management about it. There are several problems here like this that takes up a lot of your time \"band-aiding\". Second Con: People are willing to try harder not to work and to pass on problems because there's literally nothing anyone will do about it. Employees have no fear of ever loosing their job and because of this, the people who do actually work and care get overwhelmed. With this and the \"band-aids\" you'll almost never catch a break. Third Con: The union here is a problem. They should be maintaining a good workforce rather than a workforce who tries not to work. Forth Con: Salary has their \"favorites\". Some employees can get away with hanging out all day and salary will look the other way. Meanwhile, they give the people who work the jobs and say\"We have to get it done\" or \"I know you'll do it right\" or \"I dont want to argue with them so i'm giving it to you\" ect.. Last Con: Untrained employees holding positions without even being evaluated. We have one now in our position and will get themselves hurt or someone else.
