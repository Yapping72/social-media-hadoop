One walk around the offices shows moroseness, heads down, scared looking, and staring blankly ahead. Nobody says greetings like \"good morning\" or \"hello.\" It is horrible. Read the other reviews on Glassdoor.\r\nIn order of worst Cons: \r\n1. Seems to be that employees are the \"enemy\" and they are frequently undermined. No pun intended. \r\n2. Salary - Initially, salary seemed pretty good, but company has a habit of unilaterally cutting base salaries and benefits whenever possible, sometimes up to 30% or more. This can be a blanket \"removal of allowances\" or a restructure of the bonus calculation - all with the aim of reducing salaries paid to employees. Similarly, almost any time a role is refilled, the \"banding\" or salary range will be downgraded so that the incoming replacement is shorted some compensation. Similarly, roles often get combined or off-shored so have to do more for less\r\n3. It is an \"old boys network\" in the classic sense. In order to keep this lucrative musical chairs going lower downs may be undercut and outsiders never brought in. \r\n4. Backstabbing - Setting up for failure or simply not supporting are common practice in my experience, it is the accepted way of work here. It is remarkable that anything actually gets done (not much does) due to the constant plotting and restructuring and empire-building that goes on.\r\n5. Ego - Rio Tinto thinks of itself as the greatest company in the world: \"We aren't a mining company, we are a tech company \"... Well, certainly suppliers and customers laugh at that. The company doesn't want fresh or innovative ideas despite paying lip-service to this. \r\n6. Diversity and Inclusion - Or, lack of. \r\n7. No training or development budgets. This was always hidden from employers and only recently was essentially taken away. Training or development must come from departmental budgets and hence ... not supported. \r\n7. Double-speak: Rio are masters of \"saying one thing, yet doing another.\" One has to read between the lines for almost all internal communications to understand the real meaning or intent. Up is down, black is white and night is day in the Rio Tinto world. For example, the recent revision of the bonus calculation method was \"not a cost reduction exercise\" but rather a \"positive revision to make the system simpler.\" Oh, but the fact that many will get lower bonuses well, that is just a coincidence.

Senior management is comprised of disingenuous, detached individuals which demonstrate toxic narcissism and will endlessly agree with you, placate your concerns, never connect with you on any functional level, promise the world - ultimately delivering absolutely nothing. They have adopted a 20th century corporatism and business parlance which seeks to control and direct rather than relate and understand. They do excel at manipulation, coercive behavior, scheming and ambushing employees which demonstrate a threat to their weak characters and comfort zones. They are masters of covering up (multiple) incidents, insulating people in their own ranks against being held accountable for obvious and serious transgressions - particularly in safety, smelting operations and environmental damage - largely attributed to deeply ingrained behavior, and have fostered a culture of blame, negative reinforcement and arrogant avoidance to perfection. The managers here are dangerous and reckless. Its a miracle we haven't had another major incident or death in potrooms in the last few years! They are a textbook case study of a company which promotes individuals to higher stations of authority, not based on their leadership abilities or capacity to inspire, but on technical skill alone. This has been disastrous for trust and for general morale of practically all staff. Senior management are of an exceptionally low calibre, poorly educated in business, consistently demonstrate low skill - especially in public speaking and clear communication - and possess significant leadership flaws. They are not valued, trusted or generally supported by most staff onsite. But somehow, they manage to encircle themselves with sycophants of equally incompetent measure, creating a perfectly destructive and myopic echo chamber. The company has no vision, purpose, or anything over the horizon and is essentially going nowhere (except for directly into a brick wall). If it wasn't buying an enormous proportion of the power generated by Tasmania and employing half of Georgetown, it would have been shut down a long time ago. Indeed, it was nearly divested by Rio Tinto on several occasions due to being a dead weight in the portfolio - I believe the best possible outcome for people in Bell Bay is to be re-skilled and the site to shutdown permanently. With the upcoming hydrogen plant and other business developments in the region, this will be quite easy. The culture is exceptionally toxic. The site is so corrupt, that Rio Tinto saw fit to deploy at least two corporate 'plants' operating in seemingly innocuous roles on site who's job is to weed out and monitor individuals that are engaged in fraud and embezzlement. This behavior is unfortunately quite rampant. The company suffers from greatly ageing infrastructure which is constantly breaking down, sometimes shutting down half the operations with exceedingly dangerous 'fixes' applied all the time - especially in the potrooms. The site has a general hygiene level that is stunningly poor and while staff have been vehemently complaining of the high levels of dust (many containing silica) flying around the site in practically all locations, nothing has been done to address this problem outside useless token gestures, photo opportunities and a toothless committee which delivers practically nothing. This will no doubt generate many litigation opportunities in future due to gross negligence and marginalisation of concerns. In general, senior management are far too comfortable. They are not feeling enough pain to better themselves, to grow as individuals, to undergo personal development and mature. They are absolute amateurs. And a final warning, Human Resources works for and remains at the service of Senior Management. They are unskilled, corrupt, anachronistic, dogmatic and are as impartial as the Stasi was in East Germany. They do not represent the workers, are untrustworthy, do not honour confidentiality in any form and will strap you to the railroad tracks without hesitation if it suits corporate interests to do so. I have witnessed this behaviour time and time again - many of my colleagues were mistreated incredibly - and it has only gotten worse. The walls are paper thin here. Everyone knows what goes on. Always. Every one of them could be could be replaced tomorrow with Artificial Intelligence kiosks with better results. Not sure how long I will last in this backwater company. All the best and brightest have already abandoned ship, and once the younger recruits realise what they've stepped into - and we will make sure they know - they will follow. I've been here too long, but I couldn't keep my concerns bottled any longer. Hopefully this enables potential future applicants to make more informed decisions and ensure those on the mainland don't make a terrible mistake and choose this company as their next move. Stay on the mainland! Do NOT work for one of the most unethical, exploitative and corrupt companies in the world."}, {"review_title": "It\u2019s getting better", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Principal Engineer in Perth, Western Australia", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People, innovation, current CEO is making some good changes", "cons": "Big organisation problems, hard to navigate sometimes"}, {"review_title": "Good job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Interventional Radiology Technologist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work atmosphere and salary is good too", "cons": "Too much work every day few offs and breaks"}, {"review_title": "Important function pushing for credibility within the business", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Senior Sourcing Advisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great team of recruiters great flexibility", "cons": "reporting line organisational structure can cause frustrations"}], [{"review_title": "Operational superintendent", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "10 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Superintendent Drill and Blast", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits People Roster Safety Stability", "cons": "Systems Solo mentality Pay Red tape"}, {"review_title": "Great for work life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Senior Corporate Advisor in Brisbane", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Safety first priority is awesome.", "cons": "Doesn't handle industry up and downs too well - though none do"}, {"review_title": "Rio Tinto is a great company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Environmental Advisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Option of 8n6 or 5:2, 4:3.\r\n\r\nInteresting work\r\n\r\nEquip with tools, training and experienced team members to develop and process in career.\r\n\r\nGreat bonus and benefits for working with the company\r\n\r\nOnsite leadership team are supportive and proactive when it comes to compliance with environmental regulations.", "cons": "Accountability and job roles are unclear\r\n\r\nAbsent Environmental leadership on-site\r\n\r\nRecruitment has always been slow but worse than ever, team are stretched covering 1 role and now covering 2."}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Project Manager in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome company culture and management", "cons": "No as o didn't face any"}, {"review_title": "Decent at everything, exceptional at nothing", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Senior Engineer in Karratha", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Generally good opportunities if you have a supportive leader", "cons": "Operations/production distractions tend to overrule all focus time for longer term projects.

Not a specific gripe with Rio Tinto, but as for a FIFO role in general - if you happen to change panels, you will go from spending 12 hour days for a week or two at a time with a work friend, to being on the opposite panel and literally never seeing them again due to the nature of the rosters being back to back.
