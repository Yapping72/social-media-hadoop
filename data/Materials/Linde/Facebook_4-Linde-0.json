Instead of finding a solution that can help all parties, management blamed the incompetencies of the employees for the plant issues. They fail to see that the lack of manpower is one of the biggest issues as 1 employee has to manage multiple plants in different locations or regions while doing everything. Those employees who have worked in other MNC & global companies are appalled with this kind of poor hiring plan.\r\nPoor work-life balance & lack of empathy of employees wellbeing: Those who work in the operation have to work around the clock regularly until it affects their mental & health well-being. Some relationships are also affected due to this. Management has no respect of employees' personal time. One of the recent examples is that the management of the operation team insisted to do plant TEST RUN on Christmas day which prolongs until the weekend. This should be employees' personal time to spend with their family & loved ones but the lack of empathy from managers & concern on cost-saving over employees' work-life balance have forced them to be at work on holiday & weekend. \r\nLack of diversity & inclusivity: APAC & Malaysia top management are filled with mainland Indians.

With this rotational program, on top of the department I was hired into, one needs to be flexible and willing to travel, which can be difficult for some. Also, though most people in this company are willing to help, it doesn't necessarily mean the resources are there for that to happen. Sometimes people or other resources are stretched thin, and no two instances are ever completely identical, so how you make due with the resources given to you hones your leadership skills.

Really bad working conditions\r\n\r\n- The working conditions and office environment are deplorable.\r\n- Office is located on the ground floor & third floor of a somber hospital building in a below-par suburb of Porto, not exactly what you'd expect from a 17 BN dollar company. Not to mention sick hospital patients always around. \r\n- No good food amenities in the area of Maia (unless you want to bring your lunchbox to work everyday like in primary school). \r\n- The office space is too crammed and ultra noisy (hard to hold a normal customer conversation over the phone with all the background noise of other colleagues). \r\n- BAD AIR QUALITY in the office spaces: the air circulation in the offices are extremely bad as it's an old building it's an old system. Employees are complaining all the time however the only feedback from management is that they are talking to the building manager, without any action. \r\n- The toilets are generally smelly and quite filthy, again due to old building and bad/ cheap building management. \r\n- Overall not the most positive atmosphere. \r\n\r\n2. Lack of business vision, no real leadership, weak communication, processes are chaotic and inefficient.  \r\n\r\n- Frankly, I could write an entire saga on the above. The processes are so  inefficient & cumbersome that you just have the impression to be doing administration all day long, i.e. the day-to-day tasks as In-house Sales Account Manager are hardly related to sales, but mainly administrative tasks related to invoicing, coordinating deliveries, overdue payments, continuously correcting internal errors or handling customer complaints (of which there are very, very many). Not to mention the lack of leadership of management. \r\n\r\n3. High employee turnover\r\n\r\n4. Overall it's a shame that a leading company can allow such an environment for sales professionals who re the money makers for the company. I joined the company with high expectations and enthusiasm to grow at Linde, instead I was confronted with a complete lack of professionalism and empty promises."}], [{"review_title": "N/A", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Mar 2009", "job_title": " in Bethlehem, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A comfortable, but fast paced environment.
