Room for upper mobility is extremely limited and it is almost as if the positions are already pre-reserved for others."

This is a pervasive issue company-wide but it's particularly bad in the IT department and in the Service Desk, where those liked by management will get promoted regardless of qualifications, performance, or process. I have seen people getting fired just to give the position to someone's family member. I have seen entire procedures get changed to give promotions to unqualified candidates who happen to be best friends with management. I have seen entire positions get created for no purpose other than hiring specific individuals.\n-The environment within the Service Desk has eroded through the years.

Salaried professionals tend to be well-paid - most other industries and especially smaller companies cannot compete with the compensation. If you are a conscientious type (look that up in the Big 5 personality traits), then you'll love and do well at this company and you'll be rewarded with promotions every 2-3 years. Conscientious types tend to be less creative and more industrious in their work habits. \r\n\r\nThis company also takes safety very seriously at the corporate and mill-leadership levels.",
		"cons": "As with any large corporation, there is entirely too much red tape. This comes with having 50K+ employees so this isn't a personal strike against IP as company but its just a common characteristic found in companies of this magnitude. The company has international agendas that it panders to, namely with the UN, WEF, etc. so that may or may not be a problem for some. In many settings, there is pressure to conform and a fear of speaking up and telling the truth the way you see it, especially if it goes against the prevailing narrative.\r\n\r\nLastly, more about the creativity piece - This company is very mature commodities-based company and therefore has less need for someone to re-invent the wheel for them. Creativity is difficult to express in such rigid, mature industrial processes such as making paper for the largest paper company in the world. If having a creative role is your cup of tea, consider looking for a company that is still young in their business life cycle and who has a demand for innovation on a much shorter time frame. Those industries will be more appreciative of creative types (openness to experience). Again, go look up what a creative person is like in the Big 5 personality traits and go listen to Jordan Peterson on the subject of corporations and openness vs. conscientiousness. That will give you a better idea of what you're up against with this industry. If you are a creative type and you choose to work at IP, my recommendation is to have a creative hobby on the side that you take very seriously so that you can satisfy your innate desire to create something new. It is my belief that the company will fail to offer adequate opportunities to be creative - this ties back in to the company being too big for its own good and has too much red tape - such size and red tape limits how much creativity the company can entertain and the margins are too low and the stakes are too high for them to be taking large risks with paradigm-shifting ideas. \r\n\r\nConsider yourself adequately warned!"

Selective discipline measures, some people are untouchable while others get fired soon as they look at someone the wrong way. To further that point they refuse to fire deadweight and make the good operators carry the load. Cooperate refuses to give hourly raise to operations for the last 6 years but gives maintenance whatever they want. Just raised the bottom rate this month which helps no one because we certify on the first job tier within months of being hired. So minus tue utter moronic decisions made on the top end it\u2019s a good place for a career."

I said I could and started getting ready however I was told that you should always get a lot of sleep before surgery. Now with that in mind I was suppose to get off at 7 am and had surgery at 8:30am. So I called my boss and told him he said well work untill 3 am I never said yes. I worked 3 days after that and was supposed to be off for 3 days. But they fired an employee so he asked me to work I said yes. Friday a supervisor seen I was vomiting and wanted to send me home. I text my boss told him that a supervisor was sending me home because I was vomiting but I didn't want to go because I was scared it would be held against me. I never heard back so I went home. Saturday I was sick and Sunday on the way to work about 15 min before shift start my boss finally text me back( after I had called and text all day seeing I were suppose to work) telling me no not tonight. The next day I was called and fired for the dentist thing. This was a week after that had happened and I had worked days before that."

Again, everything is your fault. Even if there isn\u2019t any work to be done, you will be told you are not working fast/hard enough.

Expect little to no help if you have issues with management.\r\n-Horrible schedules.\r\n-General incompetence on the part of management. Somehow, in the middle of a paper bag shortage, they couldn\u2019t figure out how to make the plant break even, let alone turn a profit. It takes effort to fail that hard. Naturally, this was the fault of the production employees."

		"cons": "-Is overly politicized and fairly easy to commit career suicide - sometimes without even realizing you did! You need to have tact & be familiar with the skills associated with the \"dog & pony show\". A silver tongue w/ a can-do and positive attitude are required for most people to advance to certain levels in the company. Just being good at your job is not in itself enough to soar with this company - you have to develop your soft skills although there have been a few old-school hold-outs that made it pretty far up in the ranks prior to the progressive HR agenda being implemented. Just like ANY OTHER BIG CORPORATION, there are unspoken social rules that are unethical & hypocritical (double-standard) that one must play by in order to advance IN CERTAIN AREAS of the company. Not all areas require these unspoken soft skills to advance consistently. \r\n-Health Insurance benefits are scant while premiums are high (this may not be a criticism of the company benefits as much as it is a criticism of the current health insurance and medical regulatory environment. Packages are largely unchanged from when I started back in 2012 - but what did change was the premiums doubled between 2012 - 2018 for family while the coverage remained stagnant. Obamacare is to blame for the premiums while IP is to blame for not adapting and remaining competitive by carrying the weight of the premiums - further premium hikes now get passed to the employee. \r\n-Match pay on 401K is marginal - average is around $.60 on the dollar for the first 8% (it isn't terrible but I've seen considerably better)"

		"cons": "Business direction is shaky. The division I was in had more turnover (corporate, management and onsite positions) this past year than I have seen in 5 years of working for this company. Corporate is constantly moving their employees around between businesses or location sites. Each corporate leader is looking to implement different standards and goals, so sites keep having to change business direction. Recently there were two projects that were bringing in revenue (and had potential to bring in much more if marketing developed better customer leads) that were ended. During tough fiscal times that the industry is going through, one must wonder why these projects were ended. \r\n\r\nDirect leadership are over worked because they often have their own project work to do, typically manage other people and their careers, as well as continually having to take on new duties since this location is in a hiring freeze but has had several retirements and turnover. They will toe the corporate line and not go to bat for you if it means rocking the boat.\r\n\r\nCommunication is awful at pretty much every level. Between project managers, scientists and technicians. Between management and everyone else. There is too ambiguity and inconsistency. This in the end can be expensive because if work is done incorrectly, you have wasted hours and materials. Much information has to pass through the rumor mill instead of formal communication to all employees. Creates mistrust and misunderstandings, has been compounded by CoVid-19 while 50-66% of the building are working from home.\r\n\r\nFew opportunities for for tangible growth (raises and promotions are far and few between, even for valuable employees/high performers). It is often that you are presented with \"growth and leadership\" opportunities, however, this is their way of adding responsibilities to your job that expand your capabilities but will not be financially compensated for. Sure, you will get the annual raise, but to move through PLs takes promotions. In 5 years, I have only seen 4 promotions. All except one of which were for people that had been there 7-13 years and had been waiting 5-7 of them for a promotion. Bonus program is only available to those at high scientist and management level. \r\n\r\nThere are more than a few examples where technicians are doing scientist work yet have not been formally promoted. Those onsite are relied up now more than ever to take care of things that are not their responsibility. CoVid-19 has allowed for many of the scientist and project managers to \"work from home\" and some have become disconnected from the onsite work. For example, there are certain scientist that expect next day or two turn around for their work, just because they decided to finally submit something (because they are coming up against a deadline and realized they need some data to present) when there is work already in process to be completed. \r\n\r\nClique culture. Most of these employees have worked together for 10+ years and are able to regale you with stories of the \"good old days\". Though most are friendly, I have seen cases of when people just don't fit in and can lead to being black balled out of working in an area or a project. Beware the bullies and steamrollers! If you're into that, manipulation of the \"right\" people will work here. You will find that if you target and befriend highly influential people, it will put you in a position to be treated favorably. Some managers will not evaluate you by your work ethic but instead how you the fa\u00e7ade that is presented. \r\n\r\nInstead of productivity and quality in which one completes their work, there is a heavy emphasis on networking and attending all of the non-essential meetings and activities. There is no possible way to do your job successfully and attend everything. People who are in attendance of everything are those who want to 1. avoid their actual work responsibilities, 2. brown nose to the \"right\" people to be noticed. \r\n\r\nCompany values (like safety) tend towards being just lip service with no action, particularly if the price tag to upkeep their values is too expensive. The only safety officer onsite had their position eliminated. The nurse that was contracted onsite 3 days a week, no longer is available, instead there is a virtual nurse. Despite having 3 medical incidents onsite within the past year. AND weathering a pandemic. Also, due to the decreased capacity of the building, they are waiting to re-sign their evening custodial service. We have just one (amazing, kind and hard working) custodian during the work hours that covers cleaning and disinfecting the high touch areas AND daily cleaning. Keep in mind that the square footage of the building did not change."

The facility I transferred to was the Franklin VA Mill which had previously been closed. I worked there for a year on several projects to change the facility to a Mill that makes Fluff. I had the worst boss ever. He was to busy to assign me projects so sent me out to hunt for my own. When any project did run into trouble he offered no assistance nor advise. I was treated like a REACH Engineer even though I came in knowing all the tools and demonstrating all the ability to successfully execute projects. I was given no credit for the numerous projects I had completed successfully but given all the credit when a small issue arose, which I fixed as well. I had weekly sit downs with my manager to go over my projects and he still could not tell you what I had done right."

I have had directors and senior managers information technology lie to my face and when you show them your CSA is impacted. If you are long term employee your contribution does not count. Want a prime example, CORE have a budget, they often spend time with VP, Directors, Sr. Managers, etc. They are spoon fed positions. They get training on leadership that long term employees do not get. CORE have little experience and even if you are not accepted into because you do not meet requirements by CORE, a VP or Director can have you put into CORE. Just go look at some of the CORE GPAs."

The comp, benefits, vacation, etc., are fairly standard.  Start before New Years, and you'll pick up nearly a full year toward your vacation increase at 5 years (effectively waiting only 4 years to get that extra week off).  IP is a steady and predictable employer, and managers generally do their best to ensure a happy, healthy workforce.  If you're willing to go out on the limb, branch out and learn a new position, you will usually be encouraged.  They're big enough to absorb your vacancy, meaning you're usually 'releasable' to another manager for internal moves, and standouts are recognized.  Shared Services model in IT allows if not encourages cross-pollination and syntopical learning.  You can be silo'd if you choose to be, or you can float positions every couple of years if you like.  It is unlikely that a solid worker would be downsized, as efforts are made to retain 'people', not just positions.  I had an excellent experience at IP, and would return w/o hesitation if the circumstances making that feasible arose.",
		"cons": "If you really dig in and stick to a particular specialty, then advancement can be slow.  In big, stable companies, many other employees realize when they have it good as well, so without standout performance or a few lateral moves (to round out technical and business experience), advancement might take a while.\r\nIF an individual thrives in a churning environment, then a smaller company with less process and planning might be preferred.  The truly restless acheiver might feel stagnate, but again, a change of position and new learning is one way to keep things interesting w/o changing companies.  IP is big enough to sustain some employee drift within the organization.  If I had it to do over, I would have 'drifted' through more roles."

If you work at corporate, there are even greater perks such as drawings for attending arena events like NBA games and major concerts or getting classroom projects sent to your child's school like watching butterflies grow or magazine subscriptions.",
		"cons": "I felt like the company bullied Memphis when it threatened to leave the city unless it extended a tax benefit it had been receiving for 20 years. As someone who remembers attending school without air conditioning, that tax revenue from this multi-billion dollar company was greatly missed by the city's school system, yet the company will like to tout its $1-2M charitable donations per year to local organizations.  \r\n\r\nAfter getting it's way and expanding it's HQ, you would think maybe an onsite daycare or pumping rooms would have been included as part of the plan with what more modern-engaged companies are doing, but maybe that's a symptom of the leadership being mainly baby-boomers.  \r\n\r\nAlso, a lot of the field locations are in the boondocks. So for younger employees, the prospect of spending three or more years of your best years in a place that lacks basic recreation or the potential for finding a partner becomes bleak no matter how much they pay you.  \r\n\r\nIf you aren't careful, you will notice that IP will slowly, but surely become your life. Meanwhile, piece by piece you will have given up the parts of your life that made you who you are.  It's a lot of people there that have spent their entire careers at the company so it's all they know.  As a result, if you have an existing, continual commitment in your life that conflicts with work arrangements, these types of employee feel like you just need to give up what it is you've always done before you got there because IP is all that matters and there should be not flexibility on its part. \r\n\r\nAt IP, you get sold the mantra of infinite possibilities regarding career opportunities.  However, what they don't tell you is that at the end of the day, they will place you where they want you to go when they want you to go there.  So that means even if there's an opportunity available for which you qualify, you may not get it because your manager considers you to be non-releasable.  There also isn't a whole lot of credence given to your experience gained outside of the company.  It's almost as if what you had done before doesn't matter because they didn't see you do it there."

The company has recently refocused attention on core highly profitable long term businesses - making boxes for example and has become a world leader in this market and others. \r\nThe company has been around for a long time (over 100 years) and is likely to be around for a lot longer. If you are interested in a large multinational with slow and steady growth, this is it. \r\n\r\nMr. Faraci is in touch with his Memphis employees and is leading the company in the right direction. He took a very bold step in raising cash and taking on substantial debt to purchase a division from Weyerhaeuser but I believe that it was the right decision for the company.",
		"cons": "This is low profit margin manufacturing large multinational company. \r\nTherefore there are many layers of management, too many useless and duplicate reports to do and other seemingless foolish administrative tasks that are not apparently useful to those working in the trenches. \r\nFor similar reasons the company wants to justify every project and watches it's money very closely. \r\nChanges have to regarded \r\nMid level managers may be under utilized and therefore have time to micromanage. Some employees, due to the size of the company, and a somewhat lax management attitude in some areas, feel that they can get away with not working. They may in the short term but International Paper will terminate them eventually (may take years) .  \r\nCorporate at time's seems to kowtow to businesses units and manufacturing facilities, taking the attitude that if they say they have to have then they must be .\r\nToo many \"diverse\" employee's in positions that they are unqualified and unsuited for. \r\nIn some areas I have witness'ed a cliques led by managers lead to incometence being ignored.\r\nMany employees know \"the system \" is broken and dont try to attempt to fix it any more and instead just allow it continue by lying about others performance or by finding another way to accomplish a task.\r\nThus failures are glossed over and allowed to continue. \r\n\r\nThe company continues to pay lip service to environmental causes and in some cases is hypocritical.\r\nFor example the company will say one thing, and do another : it has an impressive media campaign that printing on paper is better than emailing yet internally has diverted all paper notices to email versions. \r\nLarge office buildings within Memphis, could and should have been made green decades ago (solar panels) , an investment that would have paid for itself already. \r\nCompany does not internally recycle cans, glass or plastic . Nor does it lead such recycling programs within the community.  \r\nThe company has reduced it's north american land holdings, avoiding the responsibility of land stewardship while at the same time promoting such stewardship.\r\n\r\nThe company continues to off shore as much work as possible. The US staff continue to drive the work but understand less and less as they have a hands off attitude and become more and more project managers. This results in systems which no one understands 2 years after building, and which often do not work. \r\n\r\nCorporate divisions such as Human Resources and IT are understaffed and have insufficient resources, leading to long lag times or no response."

Real expectations vs imaginary expectations.\r\nWork/life balance is horrid in many locations. Salaried employees get paid based on 49hr work weeks, but are often expected to work 6-7 days a week in practice - averaging 60-80hrs in many positions. Often-times hourly work the same, but even overtime pay comes at a cost to their personal lives - voluntary or not.\r\nThe older-in-age management often have antiquated expectations of work-ethic where your work is your #1 loyalty and you will come in in the middle of the night and every weekend if we tell you to.

While I might be able to make more 'cash' at some other places, it wouldn't make up for the stability that IP has offered me, along with the total benefits package. Their Retirement plans are good, health benefits are decent, and there are many other benefits outside of these realms. I have actually gotten training, whereas many companies will promise training - IP delivered. There are a lot of good people to work with as well, I have had no major issues with management and even the 'high level' mangers are approachable, for the most part. From my experience, upper management is as in touch with their employees as they can be in an organization of this size. Outside of entire facility closure, I haven't seen any layoffs and even in those cases, the chances of being able to relocate (if willing) and maintain a position with IP have been good to excellent. In most areas there is little outsourcing and much of that is 'temp to hire' - and they actually do hire in many of those cases, if you do a good job. Additionally; while there is some debate overall on the subject, for the most part - hard work is rewarded. Very good life/work balance - when I needed time off the most, it wasn't even questioned - a manager 3 levels above me told me to take the time I need for my family.",

There are opportunities to move around and try different group within departments and among departments and relaxing working environment",

The bonus program starts kind of late compared to other corporations who have done it for a long time. Relied too heavily on SAP as their main ERP software made the company slower to adapt to a new trends, and the SAP software is great, but the analytical software came with SAP are usually buggy and have quite few issues sometime with not a lot of online supporting material to research."

This is a pervasive issue company-wide but it's particularly bad in the IT department and in the Service Desk, where those liked by management will get promoted regardless of qualifications, performance, or process. I have seen people getting fired just to give the position to someone's family member. I have seen entire procedures get changed to give promotions to unqualified candidates who happen to be best friends with management. I have seen entire positions get created for no purpose other than hiring specific individuals.\n-The environment within the Service Desk has eroded through the years. You will be micromanaged to extremes, you will not have many opportunities to grow or learn beyond the scope of the job, and you will see your rights and privileges diminish as months go by."

Salaried professionals tend to be well-paid - most other industries and especially smaller companies cannot compete with the compensation. If you are a conscientious type (look that up in the Big 5 personality traits), then you'll love and do well at this company and you'll be rewarded with promotions every 2-3 years. Conscientious types tend to be less creative and more industrious in their work habits. \r\n\r\nThis company also takes safety very seriously at the corporate and mill-leadership levels.",
		"cons": "As with any large corporation, there is entirely too much red tape. This comes with having 50K+ employees so this isn't a personal strike against IP as company but its just a common characteristic found in companies of this magnitude. The company has international agendas that it panders to, namely with the UN, WEF, etc. so that may or may not be a problem for some. In many settings, there is pressure to conform and a fear of speaking up and telling the truth the way you see it, especially if it goes against the prevailing narrative.\r\n\r\nLastly, more about the creativity piece - This company is very mature commodities-based company and therefore has less need for someone to re-invent the wheel for them. Creativity is difficult to express in such rigid, mature industrial processes such as making paper for the largest paper company in the world. If having a creative role is your cup of tea, consider looking for a company that is still young in their business life cycle and who has a demand for innovation on a much shorter time frame. Those industries will be more appreciative of creative types (openness to experience). Again, go look up what a creative person is like in the Big 5 personality traits and go listen to Jordan Peterson on the subject of corporations and openness vs. conscientiousness. That will give you a better idea of what you're up against with this industry. If you are a creative type and you choose to work at IP, my recommendation is to have a creative hobby on the side that you take very seriously so that you can satisfy your innate desire to create something new. It is my belief that the company will fail to offer adequate opportunities to be creative - this ties back in to the company being too big for its own good and has too much red tape - such size and red tape limits how much creativity the company can entertain and the margins are too low and the stakes are too high for them to be taking large risks with paradigm-shifting ideas. \r\n\r\nConsider yourself adequately warned!"

Cooperate refuses to give hourly raise to operations for the last 6 years but gives maintenance whatever they want.

I had a dental surgery on a day I was not scheduled to work. My boss called and asked if I could work on that night( my surgery in the morning). I said I could and started getting ready however I was told that you should always get a lot of sleep before surgery. Now with that in mind I was suppose to get off at 7 am and had surgery at 8:30am. So I called my boss and told him he said well work untill 3 am I never said yes. I worked 3 days after that and was supposed to be off for 3 days. But they fired an employee so he asked me to work I said yes. Friday a supervisor seen I was vomiting and wanted to send me home. I text my boss told him that a supervisor was sending me home because I was vomiting but I didn't want to go because I was scared it would be held against me. I never heard back so I went home. Saturday I was sick and Sunday on the way to work about 15 min before shift start my boss finally text me back( after I had called and text all day seeing I were suppose to work) telling me no not tonight. The next day I was called and fired for the dentist thing. This was a week after that had happened and I had worked days before that."

		"cons": "-Is overly politicized and fairly easy to commit career suicide - sometimes without even realizing you did! You need to have tact & be familiar with the skills associated with the \"dog & pony show\". A silver tongue w/ a can-do and positive attitude are required for most people to advance to certain levels in the company. Just being good at your job is not in itself enough to soar with this company - you have to develop your soft skills although there have been a few old-school hold-outs that made it pretty far up in the ranks prior to the progressive HR agenda being implemented. Just like ANY OTHER BIG CORPORATION, there are unspoken social rules that are unethical & hypocritical (double-standard) that one must play by in order to advance IN CERTAIN AREAS of the company. Not all areas require these unspoken soft skills to advance consistently. \r\n-Health Insurance benefits are scant while premiums are high (this may not be a criticism of the company benefits as much as it is a criticism of the current health insurance and medical regulatory environment. Packages are largely unchanged from when I started back in 2012 - but what did change was the premiums doubled between 2012 - 2018 for family while the coverage remained stagnant. Obamacare is to blame for the premiums while IP is to blame for not adapting and remaining competitive by carrying the weight of the premiums - further premium hikes now get passed to the employee. \r\n-Match pay on 401K is marginal - average is around $.60 on the dollar for the first 8% (it isn't terrible but I've seen considerably better)"

		"cons": "Business direction is shaky. The division I was in had more turnover (corporate, management and onsite positions) this past year than I have seen in 5 years of working for this company. Corporate is constantly moving their employees around between businesses or location sites. Each corporate leader is looking to implement different standards and goals, so sites keep having to change business direction. Recently there were two projects that were bringing in revenue (and had potential to bring in much more if marketing developed better customer leads) that were ended. During tough fiscal times that the industry is going through, one must wonder why these projects were ended. \r\n\r\nDirect leadership are over worked because they often have their own project work to do, typically manage other people and their careers, as well as continually having to take on new duties since this location is in a hiring freeze but has had several retirements and turnover. They will toe the corporate line and not go to bat for you if it means rocking the boat.\r\n\r\nCommunication is awful at pretty much every level. Between project managers, scientists and technicians. Between management and everyone else. There is too ambiguity and inconsistency. This in the end can be expensive because if work is done incorrectly, you have wasted hours and materials. Much information has to pass through the rumor mill instead of formal communication to all employees. Creates mistrust and misunderstandings, has been compounded by CoVid-19 while 50-66% of the building are working from home.\r\n\r\nFew opportunities for for tangible growth (raises and promotions are far and few between, even for valuable employees/high performers). It is often that you are presented with \"growth and leadership\" opportunities, however, this is their way of adding responsibilities to your job that expand your capabilities but will not be financially compensated for. Sure, you will get the annual raise, but to move through PLs takes promotions. In 5 years, I have only seen 4 promotions. All except one of which were for people that had been there 7-13 years and had been waiting 5-7 of them for a promotion. Bonus program is only available to those at high scientist and management level. \r\n\r\nThere are more than a few examples where technicians are doing scientist work yet have not been formally promoted. Those onsite are relied up now more than ever to take care of things that are not their responsibility. CoVid-19 has allowed for many of the scientist and project managers to \"work from home\" and some have become disconnected from the onsite work. For example, there are certain scientist that expect next day or two turn around for their work, just because they decided to finally submit something (because they are coming up against a deadline and realized they need some data to present) when there is work already in process to be completed. \r\n\r\nClique culture. Most of these employees have worked together for 10+ years and are able to regale you with stories of the \"good old days\". Though most are friendly, I have seen cases of when people just don't fit in and can lead to being black balled out of working in an area or a project. Beware the bullies and steamrollers! If you're into that, manipulation of the \"right\" people will work here. You will find that if you target and befriend highly influential people, it will put you in a position to be treated favorably. Some managers will not evaluate you by your work ethic but instead how you the fa\u00e7ade that is presented. \r\n\r\nInstead of productivity and quality in which one completes their work, there is a heavy emphasis on networking and attending all of the non-essential meetings and activities. There is no possible way to do your job successfully and attend everything. People who are in attendance of everything are those who want to 1. avoid their actual work responsibilities, 2. brown nose to the \"right\" people to be noticed. \r\n\r\nCompany values (like safety) tend towards being just lip service with no action, particularly if the price tag to upkeep their values is too expensive. The only safety officer onsite had their position eliminated. The nurse that was contracted onsite 3 days a week, no longer is available, instead there is a virtual nurse. Despite having 3 medical incidents onsite within the past year. AND weathering a pandemic. Also, due to the decreased capacity of the building, they are waiting to re-sign their evening custodial service. We have just one (amazing, kind and hard working) custodian during the work hours that covers cleaning and disinfecting the high touch areas AND daily cleaning. Keep in mind that the square footage of the building did not change."

I was treated like a REACH Engineer even though I came in knowing all the tools and demonstrating all the ability to successfully execute projects.

I have had directors and senior managers information technology lie to my face and when you show them your CSA is impacted. If you are long term employee your contribution does not count. Want a prime example, CORE have a budget, they often spend time with VP, Directors, Sr. Managers, etc. They are spoon fed positions. They get training on leadership that long term employees do not get. CORE have little experience and even if you are not accepted into because you do not meet requirements by CORE, a VP or Director can have you put into CORE. Just go look at some of the CORE GPAs."

I asked what area I need to improve and again I was told that they want to see more. They did not say that anything was wrong, they just wanted to see if I would keep up with what I had been doing. Same thing happened on my 12 month review. When I asked why I wouldn't make more than starting pay for being there for 12 months, I was told that there were people there for 10 years still making starting pay! I asked them why they had the raises put on a calendar system and I was told that they had to put something down!\r\nI left them with only a 2 day notice.\r\nDo you self a favor and don't work there."

The comp, benefits, vacation, etc., are fairly standard.  Start before New Years, and you'll pick up nearly a full year toward your vacation increase at 5 years (effectively waiting only 4 years to get that extra week off).  IP is a steady and predictable employer, and managers generally do their best to ensure a happy, healthy workforce.  If you're willing to go out on the limb, branch out and learn a new position, you will usually be encouraged.  They're big enough to absorb your vacancy, meaning you're usually 'releasable' to another manager for internal moves, and standouts are recognized.  Shared Services model in IT allows if not encourages cross-pollination and syntopical learning.  You can be silo'd if you choose to be, or you can float positions every couple of years if you like.  It is unlikely that a solid worker would be downsized, as efforts are made to retain 'people', not just positions.  I had an excellent experience at IP, and would return w/o hesitation if the circumstances making that feasible arose.",

In big, stable companies, many other employees realize when they have it good as well, so without standout performance or a few lateral moves (to round out technical and business experience), advancement might take a while.\r\nIF an individual thrives in a churning environment, then a smaller company with less process and planning might be preferred.  The truly restless acheiver might feel stagnate, but again, a change of position and new learning is one way to keep things interesting w/o changing companies.  IP is big enough to sustain some employee drift within the organization.  If I had it to do over, I would have 'drifted' through more roles."

If you work at corporate, there are even greater perks such as drawings for attending arena events like NBA games and major concerts or getting classroom projects sent to your child's school like watching butterflies grow or magazine subscriptions.",
		"cons": "I felt like the company bullied Memphis when it threatened to leave the city unless it extended a tax benefit it had been receiving for 20 years. As someone who remembers attending school without air conditioning, that tax revenue from this multi-billion dollar company was greatly missed by the city's school system, yet the company will like to tout its $1-2M charitable donations per year to local organizations.  \r\n\r\nAfter getting it's way and expanding it's HQ, you would think maybe an onsite daycare or pumping rooms would have been included as part of the plan with what more modern-engaged companies are doing, but maybe that's a symptom of the leadership being mainly baby-boomers.  \r\n\r\nAlso, a lot of the field locations are in the boondocks. So for younger employees, the prospect of spending three or more years of your best years in a place that lacks basic recreation or the potential for finding a partner becomes bleak no matter how much they pay you.  \r\n\r\nIf you aren't careful, you will notice that IP will slowly, but surely become your life. Meanwhile, piece by piece you will have given up the parts of your life that made you who you are.  It's a lot of people there that have spent their entire careers at the company so it's all they know.  As a result, if you have an existing, continual commitment in your life that conflicts with work arrangements, these types of employee feel like you just need to give up what it is you've always done before you got there because IP is all that matters and there should be not flexibility on its part. \r\n\r\nAt IP, you get sold the mantra of infinite possibilities regarding career opportunities.  However, what they don't tell you is that at the end of the day, they will place you where they want you to go when they want you to go there.  So that means even if there's an opportunity available for which you qualify, you may not get it because your manager considers you to be non-releasable.  There also isn't a whole lot of credence given to your experience gained outside of the company.  It's almost as if what you had done before doesn't matter because they didn't see you do it there."

The problem with ITCS is that they are a cost center for the manufacturing decision they work and even though they pretend to have a chain of command I can't count the times a Division manager went around 3 levels of management to talk directly to me about a problem. \r\n\r\nI was always very uncomfortable in this situation, not because I couldn't handle the pressure from engineering, but because I would regularly get told by my own bosses not to directly speak to these individuals.  I found the management on my side to over react to small complication instead of seeking advise from those actually aware of the circumstance.\r\n\r\nAs a large corp you will be subjected to what ever management buzz course is being forced on your team for the year.

If you are interested in a large multinational with slow and steady growth, this is it. \r\n\r\nMr. Faraci is in touch with his Memphis employees and is leading the company in the right direction.

Some employees, due to the size of the company, and a somewhat lax management attitude in some areas, feel that they can get away with not working.

Nor does it lead such recycling programs within the community.  \r\nThe company has reduced it's north american land holdings, avoiding the responsibility of land stewardship while at the same time promoting such stewardship.\r\n\r\nThe company continues to off shore as much work as possible. The US staff continue to drive the work but understand less and less as they have a hands off attitude and become more and more project managers. This results in systems which no one understands 2 years after building, and which often do not work. \r\n\r\nCorporate divisions such as Human Resources and IT are understaffed and have insufficient resources, leading to long lag times or no response."

I have actually gotten training, whereas many companies will promise training - IP delivered. There are a lot of good people to work with as well, I have had no major issues with management and even the 'high level' mangers are approachable, for the most part. From my experience, upper management is as in touch with their employees as they can be in an organization of this size. Outside of entire facility closure, I haven't seen any layoffs and even in those cases, the chances of being able to relocate (if willing) and maintain a position with IP have been good to excellent. In most areas there is little outsourcing and much of that is 'temp to hire' - and they actually do hire in many of those cases, if you do a good job. Additionally; while there is some debate overall on the subject, for the most part - hard work is rewarded. Very good life/work balance - when I needed time off the most, it wasn't even questioned - a manager 3 levels above me told me to take the time I need for my family.",

		"cons": "Though the pay scale is commensurate with other companies, getting a promotion is usually very difficult. Like a lot of large companies where employees make good salaries, there is a lot of jealousy and envy amongst the employees about what each other is making. Who tells them? Instead of looking for very talented help and rewarding them for a job well done, they reward mediocrity with their sliding, bell curve based salary determination scale. If an employee has been doing excellent work for numerous years, they may get an increase in salary of up to 5%. (though it is usually between 0 & 1%, like .47% for example.) \r\nOn the other hand, if an employee has been borderline at performing their job for most of their career, and they suddenly do their job, they get rewarded with the maximum 5% increase in salary! Where is the incentive for the high performers to keep producing? It's the proverbial story of the horse pulling the cart and the one tied to the back of the cart. The horse pulling the cart gets whipped if they suddenly let up, but the one following behind the cart doing nothing to help pull the cart, just keeps getting fed, watered and groomed!"
