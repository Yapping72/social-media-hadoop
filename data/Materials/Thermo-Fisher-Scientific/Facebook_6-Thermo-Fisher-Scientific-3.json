There remains quite a bit of overlap and silos that result in unnecessary duplication of functions and resources, territory disputes, office politics, and communication challenges. Except for a very few functions, expect to be frustrated by this on a regular basis.\r\n- Advancement opportunities are lacking and raises are paltry compared with competitors. The company does emphasize \"lateral moves\" into other roles, which I appreciatively took advantage of during my career at Thermo Fisher. However, in my own experience many times this resulted in others coming in who were completely unfamiliar with a product line that took on a management or oversight role where they have no clear idea what the product really is, how it is used, or how it is manufactured. It is also exhausting to have to re-introduce yourself to your new manager and to justify your existence and importance to the team if you're doing it 3-4 times a year.\r\n- The websites are truly an absolute dumpster fire and the company has no easy solutions to address it. It is difficult to get a customer interested in a product when they themselves cannot find it on the website.\r\n- Constant instability, turnover, layoffs that weren\u2019t fully thought through, and unrealistic expectations. As a result, there was frequently a lot of friction and resulting drama between on-site employees or underhanded tactics from mid-level managers that subsequently amplified the drama and hampered productivity (i.e. artificially inflating numbers, stealing resources and materials from other groups in the middle of the night to \"hold down the budget\").\r\n- The open-plan office space and dearth of conference and huddle rooms at many larger sites make it logistically difficult to schedule and hold meetings\r\n- Many of the Senior Directors and VP's seem to have an almost \"Cult of Personality\" problem. While Thermo Fisher has a top-notch Internal Communications and PR Shop, the focus on AV, bright lights, and showmanship versus more open, honest dialogue and communication results in it being an uninformative pablum. Why does there need to be a DJ and produced light show at a site's quarterly Town Hall discussing company performance? Isn't that a bit excessive? Why does the Leadership and Marketing Teams need to frequently come in and disrupt the lab operation to \"play act\" science for the camera? If you have a question or concern regarding a decision being rolled out from the top, do not expect a speedy or satisfying answer, or even a forum to gain further clarity\r\n- I did experience the ultimate insult of finding out I was about to be laid off but before that was going to happen, I was asked to train my replacement on another continent."}, {"review_title": "Getting better!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Jun 2010", "job_title": "Human Resources Coordinator in Allentown, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "New communication and desire to unit business units with new CEO Marc Casper.

You have manufacturing leadership yelling at employees or humiliating them.  I recall a time when a leader yelled at a new employee until the employee was in tears.   Then you have site leadership who are barely on site. \r\nThere was hope at one time when they had new Global Leadership, but anyone with new ideas eventually gets pushed out due to the aggressive politics. I never imagined that someone doing the right thing for the organization, and getting departments in alignment with regulations would be pushed out.

Still, due to the politics involved, the site leaders used hearsay rather than facts to maintain the status quo; I won\u2019t stoop to their level and describe the sordid details.

Re-Org fatigue is common. Closing sites and moving product lines often. Due to lack of vision and mature leadership, they only focus on cost cutting and M&A, which both are easy and most companies can do on drop of the hat. They fail in real leadership which is Inovation, organic growth, trend setter, game changer, best place to work, and emloyee empowerment. You have to go to Genentech/Amgen to see that. They have problem with letting go incompetent leaders and staff.

This type of behavior shouldn't be displayed in the work environment; at least do it behind closed doors.\n\nNo Work-life balance. Machines and equipment break down at least 5+ times a day and they demand workers to stay over. Ex. Shipping hours are 9:30am to 6pm. Very frequently don't get out until after 10pm each shift. Where's OSHA? Employees are afraid to say anything due to retaliation. \n\nGetting time off is a joke unless you are friends with the managers and supervisors... you can get any day and time off you want with no consideration for coworkers.\n\nThe HR department is a JOKE. They are so unhelpful and always act like you bothering them. There is a clear distinction between how whites and minorities are treated. Imagine you get in trouble for using certain restrooms that are located on the DC floor. They might as well put up 'Whites Only' sign on them! \n\nNot everyone is held to the same standards, policies and procedures. The attendance policy is enforced on employees who don't kiss their assess while their friends can call out of work 2-3 times a week with no consequences. There is no eating/drinking allowed on the DC floor yet certain individuals blatantly violate the policy with repercussions. This is a steel toe shoe environment but supervisors are quick to write someone up when they themselves are in violation of the rules. \n\nThere is no true room for advancement. You have to be working here at least 25+ years to make anything resembling a decent wage.\n\nNumerous policy violations, double standards, and high level favoritism.
