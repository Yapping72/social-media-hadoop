I think they make a significant effort to promote from within.\r\n5.

People leave and aren't replaced, new product is brought in and no additional resources are given, a lot is expected and not much is rewarded.  \r\n  Just a personal story, I was promoted to a department Administrator from within, my pay was structured on what I was making working in the factory and not what fair for the market, meaning they got me to do the job for significantly less than an external candidate with the same credentials. Since I was promoted 2 months before the annual raises, I was excluded from my raise that year, the next year I was given a whopping $.25 raise per hour, my manager reasoned that because I had such a big raise the previous year, I was fortunate to get a raise at all.

Sadly, that is not the case now, and even more sadly, it's not unique to this company.  The old Forma employees are topped out and haven't had a raise in years, new employees are doing work for $12/hour while they stand beside someone doing the same job who makes nearly $30/hr.  This situation also leads to employees with ambition and drive to be discouraged by those who are trying to ride the last few years out before retirement.\r\n  I found there are 3 groups of people who work at Thermo in Marietta.

However when it comes time for bonus/promotions, you will be reminded that all you do is \"follow batch records\" and you don't \"go above and beyond to make drastic changes to the process\".  Which of course you WOULD (updating batch records, etc.) if you had TIME. Which you don't.\r\n\r\nYour personal goals are meaningless here, and management will straight up lie to your face about nebulous advancement opportunities just to get you to stay forever. Alternatively, they might straight up tell you that you do not do enough to move up. I'm guessing anyone less then a total savant is considered utterly useless.\r\n\r\nTrying to train on processes is like pulling teeth. They are afraid to develop people, because they are worried they will lose them. The ideal employee here is barely smart enough to do the science, is willing to be treated like a blue collar worker, can work 2x faster than a normal human and is willing to lie to support the unrealistic goals.\r\n\r\nNO JOKE. They actually discussed taping out a yellow square in front of the chemistry benches. You would have to be in this box a minimum of 8 hours a day, and any time spent away from your box (including bathroom breaks) would be unpaid. \r\n\r\nThe philosophy here is \"do more with less\". That philosophy runs DEEP here. That is how they keep the margins on the products at 90% or higher. Personnel is part of the bottom line, so they are only interested in how to keep you down and keep you in the same role forever.\r\n\r\nASK AROUND! Some people have been here for 20-30 YEARS IN THE SAME ROLE. They are not stupid, they are not lazy, they just cannot leave due to having families etc. Thermo KNOWS THIS, and they take advantage of being the only large chemistry employer in the area.\r\n\r\nI personally know of at LEAST 7 people who have had full on breakdowns due to the stress level here. There is NO WAY that is normal.  \r\n\r\nI could go on, but I think I have made my point clear enough."}, {"review_title": "Its a fantastic company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Chelmsford, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work.

Attrition at my location is about 20% a year and senior, well trained folks are replaced with junior level (aka CHEAP) workers if they are replaced at all!  Product quality and margin drop year over year and there is no connection for management between staff competence and project success.  The CEO is one of the highest paid in the world while this is not one of the most profitable companies in the world.  The upper management ranks are staffed with those that went to school with the CEO (and not a good school!), and equity is only doled out to those in the \"Club\".  Most mid and low level managers have no equity at all.  The company makes acquisitions and after a couple of years drives off the valuable employees (who often go to start competitors) squeezes who is left, drops quality, kills margin, and eventually shuts the doors! The company strives to be listed as a highly desirable employee but the work experience is so spotty across the company that for everyone who is happy, there are ten who aren't.  Company expounds on \"4 I\" values while management embraces none of them in their practices.  Management puts lots of barriers up for getting work done such as giving little authority to individual location managers as exemplified by the ridiculously low dollar value of signature authority.  Most decisions and large purchases have to be run through headquarters. While capital is tightly regulated, expenses are not.

Often good results are not as important as improving the bottom line.  \r\nWhistle blowers, Innovators, and Long term employees who are perceived as a threat to a manager are laid off.  Self promoters move very quickly up the management ladder.\r\nTraining does not exist.  Employees are left to their own devices.. this is considered good to \"weed out\"inferior employees.\r\nPay starts out slightly below market, but them remains there since all bonuses are based on \"unrealistic\" stretch goals (you enter your stretch goal, and then it gets \"upped\" 10%).\r\nCulture is growth through promotion only.  Promotion is based on face time more than results... making a good show of it and self marketing is rewarded highly.\r\nTurnover is high, VERY high.  It is a result of little opportunity and constant threat of layoff.\r\nThere is a major disconnect between Products and Management.  This is culture based.

We had the misfortune of having to work with some of the worst engineers I've encountered from their Pittsburgh facility - how these guys managed to ever ship a product, I have no idea. \r\n\r\nHowever, my biggest complains are along the line of how the company treats its own employees:\r\n\r\n1)  I had a child during my career with Thermo Fisher.  Despite planning months ahead and putting in the paperwork for paternity (unpaid, FMLA) leave, HR decided to not grant it on the week my son was due.  They refused to grant FMLA leave until the child actually arrived.  My child arrived 2 weeks late, so during the 2 weeks leading up to the child birth every few days I had a fun call with a droid in Human Resources asking if I want to use up my sick time, my vacation time or come back to work leaving a pregnant wife that couldn't drive herself anywhere for her medical checkups.  As a result, my son came into this world with me not having any sick time left to care for him if he was sick.  \r\n\r\n2)  HR would tell you that the vacation policy is inline with what is offered in industry.  What they don't tell you is that A) they combined sick and vacation days into a single PTO pool, and in the process most people with any sort of seniority lost \"time off\".  Secondly, this PTO pool is very difficult to use thanks to all the rules added in.  It is wiped clean at the beginning of the year and granted in 1/12 increments at the end of the month - so your December vacation allotment is granted on Dec 31st and wiped off the balance on Jan 1st.  To \"graciously\" allow you to use your earned vacation days, HR allows you to go up to -40 hrs on the PTO balance.  Rounding errors and such would make it hard to take all the vacation days and also it precludes the ability to take any decent vacation for the first half of the year.\r\n\r\n3)  I've since found better employment at greener pastures, and shortly after handing in my resignation I received a letter notifying me that our family's (lousy) health insurance coverage will terminate at midnight the day I walk out the door.  Every job I've had up to this point covers you until the end of the month (since the deductions from my paycheck had paid for them till the end of the month).\r\n\r\nThey wonder why 50%+ of the staff say that they'd rather work somewhere else for the same pay, and installed a pop corn machine.
