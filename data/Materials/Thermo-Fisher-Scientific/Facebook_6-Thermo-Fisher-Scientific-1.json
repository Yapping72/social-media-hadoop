They spend too much time hiring managers and having no workers to do the actual work. Every process that cooperate \"improves\" makes it harder and harder to get your work done. Its disgusting that a company making so much money can't even get their employees decent medical coverage. I still spent over $10,000 out of pocket last year on medical bills because the horrible insurance they have covers nothing. Women are treated like second class citizens at this company. They have so little respect for us that they can't even put feminine product disposal bins in the bathroom stalls. The toilet water sprays all over the toilet in the women's bathroom. It's disgusting. If you move up in the company they don't pay you fair wages for the job that you are doing, but they have no problems hiring people in off the street (at a lower level than you are) for more money. They cut off access to entrances to buildings with no warning so you then have to walk over half a mile around the entire plant to get to another entrance (all while in debilitating pain because you can't afford anymore medical bills). You are forced to work well over 40 hours a week and weekends with no overtime. This company does not care about anything other than it's own profits. They will take every short cut they can to get there. They have useless groups at this plant like security and HR, who never do their job and pass everything off onto someone else so nothing is ever resolved. They can't even put up decent cameras in the parking lot so when some hits your car and drives off there is nothing you can do but get stuck with another bill you can' afford because they pay you so little. Last year we lost 19 out of 32 people in our group. But the company does not care. They hardly even replace them. They just pass off more work to others and keep burning them out too.

Well, there\u2019s a downside to all that. The reason why you can make a good chunk of money (as an hourly employee) is due to the fact that there\u2019s a huge lack of resources namely workforce. The hiring process takes about 2-3 months to get hired therefore the workload is always challenging since most employees have to wear different hats within their role. And spend long hours inside the lab if no one is available to relieve you.\nThese are minimal cons but I felt it\u2019s important to let you know what you\u2019re getting into.\nThe biggest cons of all time? Paid parking ($430/month and they reimburse $270), expensive health insurance and subpar base pay. Although the TFS claims their pay is competitive, they pay employees 15-20% under what other biotech companies pay for the same roles. They used to offer daily passes for people who drive to work and now the only people who get a monthly pass are upper management (day or night) and the staff working at night.
