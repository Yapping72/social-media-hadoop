For sheer breadth of technology, Cisco is unmatched and that is exciting to be part of. There is plenty of money too so the company can afford to invest in many different areas, however the strategy is more to \"buy innovation\" rather than \"build it\" . \r\n\r\nThe training programs are great but you have to find them and to have time to do them - which is hard given how much work Cisco constantly expects from the level 12 and below employees.  Don't expect the managers to develop their employees either - they are too busy playing politics  to try to get to the Director and VP level, so they won't have to work so hard themselves! ;-)\r\n\r\nSome groups allow telecommute which is seen as a huge bonus by most. Benefits expensive but OK. 4 weeks vacation/sick leave combined per year. Decent severance package.", "cons": "Upper management usually seem to get the strategic vision right but there is a huge schism between upper management and the regular employees. The VP level and above is kept carefully apart from anyone who is Senior Manager level and below. There seems to be a contemptuous attitude towards the people who do the actual work from upper management that is unusual in other high tech companies for whom I have worked.\r\n\r\nCisco is also a company that shows a lack of heart and concern for the employees -  treating them as commodities to be worked hard and discarded. This comes right from the top and permeates all the way down to first and second line management. There is a coldness and unfriendliness at Cisco that is unusual for a tech company.\r\n\r\nCisco also skates very close to illegality in the way it does layoffs. Many people who get sick, even for short term, non-chronic illnesses or have pregnancies, happen to find themselves on the \"job elimination\" or \"limited restructuring\" list (the latest euphemism for layoffs) shortly after.  CAP awards for excellent performance and top ranked in other years don't matter. Someone always has to be bottom 10 and 5 each year. Not surprisingly, the percentage of women at Cisco is quite low despite the fact that the company consistently makes the \"best place for women to work\" list. This is most likely due to the prevalence of telecommute and the lack of gender and racial discrimination. \r\n\r\nPeople are constantly on edge at Cisco unless they have \"protection\"  which means knowing the right people or having been there a long time. Having an MBA also seems to be a protection, which is amusing because some of the very worst managers/directors have MBA degrees from top schools. It is common for people with newly-minted MBA degrees to be given L1 management positions as a reward. \r\n\r\nThis does not make for a nice work environment although the buildings and cafes themselves are clean, bright and pleasant. \r\n\r\nA big problem is that if you get a bad manager or Director, of which there are many,  it almost impossible to move within Cisco.  It is a case of \"damned if you do and damned if you don't\". If you stay in a bad group, you will get eliminated sooner or later because the group will be killed off but if you try to leave before, the internal job system is open and transparent, so your manager is informed that you are interviewing internally. This means that you don't just have to contend with being in a bad group but your ranking will drop to bottom 5 or 10 because you dared to try to move. This is then a sure way to lose your next bonus and to be managed out. So savvy employees only move straight after ePM/bonus time and don't announce they are leaving until they have secured the new position. However this is against company policy and many interviewing managers will not allow it.\r\n\r\nCompetence, experience, innovation, hard work and technical expertise are not valued at Cisco. Only political skills are."}, {"review_title": "Cisco after many years there.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Apr 2010", "job_title": "Engineering Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.

Most of the people are very intelligent, bright, and quite fun if there is time to get to know them.\r\n5.  Cisco has lots of process and systems in place to learn.  This is great for new hires to see how a big organization runs things.\r\n6.  ITIL is coming and Version 3 can be used to reduce process!  HP is big into it and Cisco will get it eventually.\r\n7.

Oh - you get free bagels and donuts if you go to Chamber's once a month birthday breakfast! ...Otherwise there is never a free anything because you work for it.\r\n10.

All of a sudden they are gone and it was as if they were never there.\r\n11. There is lots of work!  You have your work, the work of your co-worker that is laid off every 12 months, the work to talk to India/China, the initiatives (remember 2 each minimum to get your ranking up), the extra work to sell your work, and then the 30 to 50 extra products that Cisco is working on now.  \r\n12. Many companies are benefiting from Cisco's focus being so broad.  Cisco revenue is going up because there are so many areas too make money and individual market share is dropping in the plumbing business.  The Cisco family is creating opportunities for others!\r\n13. You learn to reward yourself and take pride in your own work.\r\n14.  This company is beyond frugal and slightly paranoid.  You will be much better with money and able to identify all your work peers as enemies in some way.\r\n15. WEBex and Telepresence are cool tools and I miss them.\r\n16.

Many of the perks are gone - no more free drinks, subsidized cafeteria is gone, you pay for your own DSL at home so you can work most nights, no cell phone reimbursement, no parties, and managers must pay for their employee Christmas lunches or events.

Get set for long hours and very little recognition unless you are in the top 20 to 30 percent in ranking.  The top >50% might get something the rest are happy with what they don't know.\r\n3.  Work in multiple time zones with jobs moving offshore.  On the phone from 8 to 10PM or at 7AM.\r\n4.  Lots of job overhead and development tools seem outdated but they mostly work.\r\n5.  There is much redundancy and product overlap yet there are feature gaps.\r\n6.  Good salary to start and minimal raises after you join.  Very difficult to get promotions.\r\n7.

What ever happened to leading the people to get more work out of them?\r\n9. Must do your 3 to 5 work projects at the same time and accomplish 2 or 3 initiatives.  Initiatives are often a farce because everyone has to have them to get their ranking up.  Then they compete for resources to do the initiatives when there is not enough people to do the work.

Once a year, senior management (director level and above) get together somewhere for a cheerleading competition. Every year, Chambers has a different direction for the company. One year they are a security company. The next year they are a process company. The year after they are an innovation company and so on and so on.

The phrase \"penny wise, pound foolish\" is very apparent at Cisco.\r\n\r\nLayoffs are a tool used regularly by management.   People are paralyzed by the fear of being a boat rocker and getting laid off which results in low morale.    Employee dissatisfaction is obvious.\r\n\r\nCompensation is okay, but raises are rare.   No cost of living increases.    Promotions are also rare.   There ere people in the same position for years.   If you want to advance your career, it won't happen at Cisco.   One tactic is to work there, get Cisco on your resume and go to a partner or another company and get a much better title and compensation, coming back to Cisco after a year or two.\r\n\r\nToo many contractors.    Cisco is trying to hit a magical number of contractors so that they can terminate them without notice instead of laying off employees.   Contractors that are currently working there get strung along for months and years.    To add insult to injury, instead of offering current contractors employee positions, Cisco hires outside folks without offering the open positions to the contractors.      \r\n\r\nThere are so many groups at Cisco, you will do one narrow range of tasks.   This leads to many jobs, especially in TAC or HTTS, being highly repetitive and un-challenging.\r\n\r\nThere are a many \"experts\" who are not.   Working at Cisco will illustrate that having a CCIE is only proof that someone can pass a test and a lab that in no way reflects the real world.  There are plenty who \"earned\" the certification by attending \"study\" sessions where people memorize questions from the written exam and scenarios leaked from the lab or by using brain dumps of questions smuggled out of the exam.

If you want to put in your 40 hours per week or less and have a life outside of work and not learn a ton of skills - probably a great place to work. If you want to pull 80+ hours per week and learn about cutting edge technologies and \"outside of the box\" problem solving methods - stay away.\r\n\r\nVery much a \"think inside of the box\" and don't question the process environment. You are there to take orders and not address problems if you see them with the current structure.\r\n\r\nThe managements philosophy on employees is to hire \"specialist\" in one particular field, work them to the bone, and then not advocate for them when they want to explore or learn other areas of the business.\r\n\r\nNo free food - and the food available is horrid. Many interns were off-put by the food that was available, nevertheless that the company did not pay for the meals.\r\n\r\nExtremely unorganized! I had a total of 4 projects cancelled due to politics and I was not told they were cancelled until I made the effort to ask managements - not conductive to teaching new talent."}, {"review_title": "Decent and solid company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "24 Oct 2016", "job_title": "Technical Lead in Boxborough, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Solid company with a mostly-wise executive steering team.

My manager seemed to be great.  Every time we met on the phone, he acted as if all was well.  He never provided any feedback or coaching.  He was very friendly.  I was offered a full time position many times, but had to turn it down because the pay was nothing short of abysmal.  \r\n\r\nThen, a very hostile customer complained about me for a rather invalid reason.  My project manager and team had my back and were in my corner.  They all explained to my manager that I was not at fault.  Suddenly, my contract was terminated.  No explanation, no communication.  I tried to talk to him just to understand, but he completely cut me off and wouldn't talk to me.  \r\n\r\nIf you are thinking about contracting at Cisco, then I strongly caution you.  If you are perfect, then all will be well.  If you do anything that causes the slightest bit of concern, then your contract will be terminated.  They won't warn you, they won't talk to you, they'll just give you the ax.  \r\n\r\nThere is a very stark difference between contractors (\"Red Badges\") and employees (\"Blue Badges\").
