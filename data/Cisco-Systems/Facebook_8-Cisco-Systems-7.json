I had previously worked at IBM and Lenovo so my observations are in comparison to those companies.\r\n\r\n- Great work culture: Excellent mix of young and old talent. Male to female ratio is 50/50. Culturally diverse workforce. Sales culture is the opposite of toxic - people genuinely celebrate in your successes and pick you up when you are having a rough quarter. The virtual sales team feels like a family and spends time together outside of working hours. The virtual sales team is also inclusive and no one is treated like an outsider (no \"clique's\")\r\n\r\n- Great work/ life balance: 4 weeks paid vacation. Everyone packs up and leaves at 5pm. Work from home one day per week. A great culture of doing meaningful work, rather than trying to look busy and stressed. Paid volunteer days. The entire company shuts down for a week in August and goes to Vegas (this is in addition to your vacation days). The company also shuts down from Dec 23rd - 31st (in addition to your vacation days). \r\n\r\n- Opportunities for career growth: In the sales organization there is a very clear and defined path for career growth. Management has the career path conversation very early to set expectations. Every 6 months a batch of people are promoted from virtual (inside) sales to field sales. Average tenure is 2.5 years in virtual sales before being promoted to field sales. Cisco also has these amazing programs:\r\n     - Ignite: Program that recruits young-in-career sales professionals from other industries and teaches them technology infrastructure sales from the ground up. These people come from industries that are completely different from technology infrastructure. \r\n     - Are you ready?: This program takes people from other Cisco business units (mainly operations), and puts them in a sales role. People who would traditionally not be able to break into sales are given the chance to try it out\r\n     - CSAP: Cisco Sales Associate Program - This is a prestigious 3 year rotational program that recruits the top university graduates. Right out of school they spend the 1st year as an Associate Sales Rep (cold calling and learning sales). The 2nd year is spent as a Virtual Sales Account Manager (inside sales). And the 3rd year is spent as a Territory Account Manager (field sales). \r\n\r\n- Excellent tools and processes: ALL OF THE TOOLS AND PROCESSES WORK. Not only do they work, but a lot of the tools talk to each other. All of the processes are well thought out and clearly defined. There is never any guess-work on how to do something complex. Cisco has mastered the art of simplifying complex processes and executing quickly. I say this because at IBM it used to take weeks to get a simple task done. At Cisco it takes minutes. MINUTES.\r\n\r\n- Best products in the industry: Cisco engineers amazing stuff. When I was at IBM, Cisco INVENTED a new datacenter product that massacred IBM's marketshare. IBM ended up selling their server business unit to Lenovo. Cisco has this same caliber of engineering in ALL of their architectures (switching, routing, wireless, datacenters, telephony, etc).\r\n\r\n- Perks: FREE PARKING. Their office is at Bay and Queens Quay and they offer free parking for every employee. I don't think I have ever heard of a company downtown that does this!  Catered lunches 2-3 days a week. Annual education stipend to take courses outside of work. Awesome prizes and spiffs. They take over your personal cell phone plan so you pay $0 and get unlimited everything (data included). Amazing high-tech office with 360 degree panoramic views of downtown Toronto and lake Ontario. All expenses paid annual trip to Vegas for EVERY sales rep across the globe.\r\n\r\n- Compensation: They are the highest paying vendor in the tech infrastructure industry. IBM paid well and when I came over to Cisco my new salary was a 63% increase from what IBM paid. I was so shocked by this that I started researching what the other vendors paid by asking around in my network. Cisco overshoots every other vendor by miles. Their sales quota's are attainable and the accelerators are bonkers when you over-achieve your quota.\r\n\r\n- Good leadership: Management regularly asks the front line reps what is working and what is not working. They take this feedback and then execute changes to the overall strategy right away. It's almost scary how quick they execute and maneuver. Management doesn't play games with front line reps either, they communicate exactly what is going on and level set our expectations regularly. Another thing I like about them is that they actually know how to get things done. A lot of managers will say \"let me know how I can help\", but reps will rarely go to them because they might screw up a complex deal by jumping into it. Not at Cisco. These managers are veteran sales people themselves and know everything about the company. If you run into obstacles they WILL cut through red tape and help you close the deal.", "cons": "Honestly, there are none.

In the last 5 years there have been 4 different Senior Vice Presidents and with each change there has been a lot of churn and changing of priorities.\r\n\r\n(2) There is a ton of in-fighting between groups (aka BUs or business units). Basically every Director and VP is incented to compete against ever other Director and VP for budget, resources, attention from executives & the sales force, etc). While this sounds normal for a large corporation, the stakes are high. Winners build set their own agedas and losers can not control their own products and often are subject to yearly layoffs. The bottom line is almost none of the teams are rowing in the same direction, rather everyone competes against each other. \r\n\r\n(3) Most importantly Cisco has a yearly layoff. Every July/August for the last 6 years the company lays off a large number of people. In that time the company has laid off more than 20,000 people and yet the number of employees is larger than ever.  I've seen entire product teams get cut when other teams could sorely use the talented people that were let go. I know someone who got an Outstanding yearly review (which is only given to 6% of people at Cisco), and he was laid-off just a week later. \r\n\r\nNormally you think of a large company as being more stable than a small one, but Cisco is not at all stable\r\n\r\n(4) It's very hard at all levels to move up at Cisco. If you are a manager who wants to become a director it's very difficult, the best way to be a director at Cisco is to be at a company that Cisco buys.

If you have a good manager and a decent territory, then the job can be satisfying, rewarding and fun. Self-starters will enjoy themselves and in some ways working for Cisco feels a lot like being self-employed (especially if you work in a remote location.)\r\n\r\nTechnical resources for engineers varies widely depending on office location and manager's personal style. If you are in San Jose, Herndon or RTP, then you will have easy access to lab equipment and gear. If you are remote, well, not so much... \r\n\r\nFor the larger sites, Cisco offers a well-laid path for supplies, access and availabilty, although getting ahold of the latest and greatest products seems to be very sporadic. (It can be tough to sell the latest product effectively if you have never seen one in person!)", "cons": "Personal experience and job satisfaction will vary widely depending on your location and on your manager. I've worked both at a large office and as a remote employee, and large office is definitely a far better experience. \r\n\r\nEven though Cisco has thousands of remote employees, they are frequently treated as an after-thought.  Mid-level managers do not seem to be trained in dealing with remote employees and many times they act as though \"out of sight, out of mind\". As a remote worker, my manager should be my main tie to corporate, but I usually got better, faster, more accurate and more complete info from friends who worked in different parts of the company.  \r\n\r\nSome managers will authorize time out of the office for training, some will not. Your ability to pursue professional development will depend completely on your current manager. Many managers feel that with the number of virtual courses available, then you should never have to take off for training. There is some merit to this postion, but you can't focus on a virtual course if you are not given the time away from your regular job to \"attend\" it. \r\n\r\nEvery August at the beginning of the fiscal year, Cisco re-organizes. Teams change, the managers change, the focus changes, etc. July is usually a useless month because everyone is holding their collective breath waiting to see how the re-org goes and in August there is always a giant account shuffle. It is completely wasteful. During one five year period I was re-organized four times. At the end of that time, I ended up more or less where I started but my team had a slightly different name. \r\n\r\nThe worst part about the annual shuffle is that incoming managers always want to tinker with the structure/focus of their team. As Systems Engineers, we had a technological specialty area that we were supposed to become experts on. Every year, the teams' new manager would change the area assignments. This forced us to set aside our other projects and re-qualify for our new team assignments. There were usually several tests involved and a couple of weeks worth of studying in order to pass them. The upheaval always seemed totally arbitrary and not at all productive.\r\n\r\nCisco does not offer a very good work/life balance. (I doubt that they have ever even heard of the term.) The only time they encourage you to take vacation is when they need to get the hours off of the books for accounting purposes.  I have had managers tell me that they want me to take vacation time, but still work on whatever project I was working on.  Also, I have seen a couple of cases where an employee was hassled by their manager for taking time off to deal with a death in the family (once for the employee's child, once for a parent.)\r\n\r\nNights and weekends are fair game for emails and phone calls. I have had a manager call me at 11 PM, just to \"catch up on things\". As a remote worker in a different time zone, I have done several conference calls between the hours of 2 AM and 4 AM . (These were not for emergency purposes, these were just for the convenience of the manager.) \r\n\r\nCisco is definitely a male-oriented company and women face a unique set of challenges. There are almost NO women in management within certain divisions. I was the only woman on my team for years, and it can be a somewhat hostile work-environment. I skipped any \"team-building\" that took place at Hooters or at strip clubs in Vegas. On one team building event during the sales meeting in Vegas, I asked to be dropped off at my hotel rather than tag along to a Gentlemen's Club . (My manager openly ridiculed me for that in front of the rest of the team.) Going to HR is widely considered to be the kiss of death to your career, so very few complaints are lodged.  I believe this sort of behavior is not tolerated in every part of Cisco because I know women who have transferred out of the division that I worked in and they said it was a different world on the outside."}, {"review_title": "Working at Cisco", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Jun 2009", "job_title": "Technical Lead in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You can balance personal life very well with job.

If you can find one that's good with people, technically sharp, and somewhat politically savvy at the same time you might be able to also get some promotions along the way as he/she rides the wave upward. You need to use your skills/merit to leverage yourself into an org that will allow you to play this game, then you can be promoted.

They postpone 6 months to 1 yr to give hikes and state lame reasons. When they do give, its not up to expectations or market rates.\r\n- They hardly give any stocks to non senior folks as rewards.\r\n- Promotions are given for good performers but management considers experience as the biggest factor for grade change. Hence, it is nearly impossible to get promoted in 1 or 2 yr even if you perform exceptionally. \r\n- Company is so big, you wont get any visibility more than 2 levels in most caseses.

He didn't ask my male coworkers this question. Even now, he 'forgets' to give me a bonus even though he gave every other report of his one (who are all male).

I've gained wonderful experiences at Cisco  and very proud to work for a company with a great name recognition and being a part of some of the most innovative ideas with some of the brightest folks.  This is a great place to start a career if you only have 5 to maybe 8 years work experience.  Also, you benefit from its strong benefits but it might be changing due to the down economy.

Cisco typically lay-off policy is that you get 60 days to find a job within the company.  If you cannot find a job within after the 60 days, then the company gives a 4 months severance + COBRA paid for during those 4 months.  Hence, it is like a 6 months severance period.  Also, Cisco pays 4 months of services for an executive search firm (Lee Hecht Harrison) to help you polish up on your interview skills, and resume building, and how to network.  That is not bad compared to other companies.", "cons": "Though, I think Cisco is a great company, there are some downsides.  I think the number #1 downside for me that has been frustrating is expanding my career within the company.  I started at Cisco within IT and after my MBA school, I wanted to explore to the Sales Organization and try to work with the account teams.  Though I made that transition, it was very very difficult to crack into it.  I did it through tireless networking and a ton of referrals.  I will always be grateful for my manager in the sales org. to give me a shot.  But truthfully, Cisco is a typical large company that does not allow folks to move from one discipline to another.  The company would rather have you quit, gain the experience outside, then come back to the company serving the job function you would want.  Or during the most recent restructuring (6k people were impacted), the company would rather lay you off, then rehire folks who have that skill/talent.  I hate mentioning that because that is classic business-school 101.  However, I know that HR is trying to rectify that problem.  However, I doubt it will work due to the culture of the company.\r\n\r\nAnother downside is getting promotions.  Though as I mention that it is a great place to start anyone's career (which is very true), the company does not do a great job of giving you promotions to keep you.  I've been at Cisco for 5+ years and never had a promotion.  Though, I've had several raises, never received a promotion (keep in mind I went from IT to sales which is maybe the reason I did not get a promotion.  Starting in a new org. brings you back to square one on the promotion track).  It is very difficult and political to receive promotions at Cisco.  So something to think about, if you are interviewing for a position within Cisco, try to get the highest possible grade level you can, If you are a mid-level manager.  If you are someone straight out of school, then you are at the mercy of the company compensating you cheap compared to its competitors."}, {"review_title": "Cisco: Good if you're looking for job security.

Cisco is also not very good at career advancement, specifically if you are an ambitious go-getter, as promotions and raises tend to have more to do with seniority and less to do with performance.  They also have an internal policy that you can not get promoted when you switch positions.  While I believe the intent was so that people do not jump from job to job simply for a pay increase, what happens in practice is top performers who move to a new opportunity for a new challenge, have to make that move laterally even when it is a job with more responsibility.  However, if you stay in the same role for years, you will eventually get promoted just because of seniority.

At the end of Cisco's FY11 (July 30th 2011) there was a massive influx and transition type order to the Cisco Global Price List (typically partner oriented deals).
