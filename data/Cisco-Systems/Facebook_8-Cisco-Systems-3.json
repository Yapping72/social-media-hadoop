With the deluge of resources to learn new technologies and skills within Cisco, workers who find themselves layed off when their area of focus is no longer relevant (profitable) almost always passed up many opportunities to reskill, move into growing tech, etc. And the writing is always on the wall well before the axe falls. \r\n\r\nNOTE: there ARE exceptions to this like when huge portions of staff at one of the Cisco sites is let go for heartless business reasons -- such as when jobs are moved overseas to save money (or when jobs are moved back because customers prefer to \"speak to someone in \"). \r\n\r\n-- Cisco gives you a choice of several nice notebook models to use (including the current year MacBook Pro 15\") as well as quality monitors and computer peripherals for your daily use. This is a nice perk if you're a bit of a nerd, which many employees are.", "cons": "CONS:\r\n-- The (very) regular restructuring / layoff events. There really MUST be a less heartless and less disheartening way of aligning human resources with ever-changing corporate goals and fluctuations in stock prices. The current method of mass purges every year can't really be called anything other than lazy and uninspired leadership with a near-sighted view of success. For a company that so prizes innovation this practice sticks out like a sore thumb.\r\n\r\n-- Oftentimes employees are dramatically underpaid for their work. Sadly, since many of these workers started with the company fresh out of college as interns, after 10+ years they will often find themselves making half of what an employee at another company with identical skills and experience makes. Since Cisco does not really ever give employees more than a few percent pay increase per year, many of these seasoned workers are trapped in a low paying position with no real hope of receiving a fair wage without leaving the company, accepting a (much) higher position at another company, and reapplying at Cisco a year or so later, at which point Cisco will match (or offer a slightly higher) wage than the worker is currently being paid. Situations like this really show that at the end of the day, a giant corporation that genuinely cares about its workers well-being, is still a giant corporation.\r\n\r\n-- The Annual layoffs\r\n\r\n-- Even when an employee is paid something close to fair market value for a specific role, the pay is typically lower than what the vast majority of other organizations will pay, and the benefits (once amazing beyond compare!) are very middle of the road. \r\n\r\n-- The annual layoffs\r\n\r\n-- Unless a candidate is truly an industry leader or posseses unique skills Cisco cannot find elsewhere, there is no real room for negotiating pay / an employment contract. If the candidate attempts to negotiate after an offer has been made and rejects the initial offer, that's the end of the ball game. The hiring manager will go on down the list of the fifty other perfectly qualified candidates and offer the job to one of them. This regular practice has cost many candidates a job when they were simply following normal, acceptable job-seeker etiquette. The unstated (but commonly understood) idea behind this behaviour is that working for a great company like Cisco is a highly valuable reward in itself, and the difference in pay is accounting for that \"fact\" -- I have never heard of anyone telling this to a candidate but I have heard managers on a number of occasion allude to this.\r\n\r\n-- The annual layoffs\r\n\r\n-- The company was founded in Californis and has always been based in California. For those who do not know, this region of the US known is known for its very strong progressive and left-leaning social and political beliefs. And while almost always a good thing, the imprint the area in which Cisco is located oftentimes makes leadership announcements, company initiatives, etc. a little bit preachy and \"holier-than-thou\" -- looking down on those who do not always agree with Cisco's political or social stances on certain topics.\r\n\r\n-- The annual layoffs. I am taking to YOU, CHUCK ROBBINS, please fix this for the sake of your loyal employees, you're so much better than this."}, {"review_title": "People-first employer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "26 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Account Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great leadership, company culture & work-life balance.", "cons": "Hard to compete effectively across all areas of a very broad portfolio."}, {"review_title": "Old-fashion company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 May 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good working life balance; focus on data security", "cons": "Tech is falling behind; old-fashioned; pay lower than FAANG"}, {"review_title": "CI Program Manager", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 May 2021", "job_title": "Program Manager in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexiable, remote work, good team, good product", "cons": "Temp employment, hard to get full time"}, {"review_title": "Product Manager", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 May 2021", "job_title": "Senior Product Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Collaborative workplace\r\n-Technology Leadership in many areas", "cons": "-Need more Cloud technology and services"}, {"review_title": "Work life balance", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Technical Support Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work life balance for employee", "cons": "I do not see any negative about Cisco"}, {"review_title": "Company Benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "22 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Well-Balanced between work and family\r\nExcellent training and growth\r\nGood opportunities to learn and excel", "cons": "Salary and compensation are not very competitive"}, {"review_title": "Good work environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Apr 2021", "job_title": "User Experience Designer in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not super stressful, diverse culture, free and interesting technology", "cons": "too many layers of management"}, {"review_title": "Great people, other aspects depend on location", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Engineering Manager in Fulton, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Capable people, camaraderie, excellent benefits", "cons": "Manager ability is hit and miss, satellite locations have little mobility, potential advancement, or keeping up with salary in area."}], [{"review_title": "Cisco is the best place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "24 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Senior Data Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Cisco is the best place to work", "cons": "Restructuring happening more frequently now a days"}, {"review_title": "Poor human resources", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in San Jose, San Jose", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The only pro was learning how bad it is.", "cons": "Lots of cons including no safety measures and really bad pay."}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Senior Supply Chain Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for.
