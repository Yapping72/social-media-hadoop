They dont like any engineer saying he/she is overloaded with work - that's something they hate to hear. So, engineers are expected to not complain, and just continue working on their stretch targets during their entire life, sacrificing their personal lives and health, so that the Management can claim to get more work done by less people. If anyone complains, they would be pushed back saying that we are not working \"optimally\", or we should think of \"automation\" instead of doing \"donkey's work\" etc. etc - That would certainly be not motivating at all, after working on complex technical problems. The management seems to be totally clueless when it comes to understanding the value of technical contributions of engineers, and they just go after some jargons and fancy terminologies and matrics.\r\n\r\nThe main responsiblity of the Management is to use the whip and constantly apply pressure on employees to squeeze the maximum out of them, which is a strtegy that is systemically pushed down from top to bottom in the hierarchy of management. They would often be hypocritical and \"encourage\" the employees to give \"open comments\", but all they are expecting is that engineers should just \"align\" themselves with the general labor strategy and directions from top.\r\n\r\nProject schedules are dervided based on a sort of \"bargaining process\" between the engineers and management, resembling some sort of civil construction work. The engineers go with a particular effort estimate which will be outright rejected by the Management, who would want \"justifications\" for every single day projected. The implicit bargaining process results in engineers cutting down the effort projections by half, agreeing to \"absorb\" the work. Eventually, the project tends to slip, and engineers work 24x7 to meet the targets, only to get constantly criticized and tortured with sarcastic comments regarding the delays and slippage.
