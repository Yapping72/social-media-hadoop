An example of how ludicrous things are here. the branding/communications/marketing function/leadership three years ago have default set everyone's internal email to 9 point Arial black. zero tolerance /harsh put down for anyone asking to understand why. management that revels in a new set of acronyms/jargon developed almost fortnightly with these latest mantras sung like portents of the new age. a new Babylon built late into every night with work to begin from scratch on a new Babylon with the next dawn. and yet for all that hard slough each day not an inch of progress/value add. absolutely no tolerance for nor any forum made available to put up a differing opinion let alone a query on the latest vibe/slough. a human 'resource' function willingly party to all manner of discrimination, micro aggressions, privilege and abuse. any 'concern' is supposedly a 'grievance' the management process of which puts the 'whiner' up front and center, with the burden of proof to provide. the 'resolution' process of any 'grievance'  is administered by and provides cover to the very people who are supposed to not be complicit in the perpetuation of these same wrongs. moot point thus to point out any wrong. not many have the guts to put up their hand let alone to stand up in this system anymore for those that have previously had such temerity were made examples of with stagnating careers, bad reviews, management opprobrium, and exclusion from any opportunity. that is if they stuck around long enough through the tarring. the bare minimum of mediocrity coupled with excellence at schmoozing is guaranteed to see one's career grow. that and one's passport/skin color/ethnicity. everyone else is told to do more, that their growth is up to them. when they hire its mostly in jurisdictions that have discriminatory /locals only bar (which they never disclose when advertising roles). the great majority of any open positions as is are always filled with 'outsiders'. such demonstrable faith they have in the capabilities and capacity of their existing staff to deliver. the organization pays out the most in locations where it does little business, head quartered and top heavy staffed in the UK where although it has never had a retail presence, its paid annually through the nose to the FSA purportedly for deposit protection?
