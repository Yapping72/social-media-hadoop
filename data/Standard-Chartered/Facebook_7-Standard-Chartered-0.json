In some cases where the locals get outcast in the team dominated by certain ethnic group (from the same country we know), their final option is to resign as a matter of time as their opinions and input at work are constantly put down or ignored while that majority group of people would pat themselves hard on each others' backs and celebrate their own ideas and 'success'.\r\n\r\nPerformance, Potential and Promotion\r\nThe system of promotion is unjust. Long service staff have been made stagnant in their career without being considered a single promotion for 5 - 10 years despite having growth potential, worked conscientiously and achieved good performance rating yearly, largely due to weak or uninterested people managers who lack the passion and drive in people\u2019s career development and the overall biased performance system and process. Staff of another team doing same nature of work with similar performance rating and sucking up to the top can be pushed for promotion every 1-2 years if their people managers are more assertive to challenge and find ways to game the system. When management tells staff there\u2019s no promotion across the board for this year, it is utter BS.\r\n\r\nWomen Leadership\r\nStrong focus on women leadership agenda over recent years also sees more promotion opportunities for female staff than their male counterparts who tried progressing up but failed (pls quit insisting HR have data to prove otherwise unless you are absolutely transparent with the raw data over the last 5 years)\r\n\r\nExternal Talent\r\nIncreasing frequency of change leadership in some support functions see high level of wastage in cost and resources. New leaders brought in externally are simply keen to tell and show success stories to higher management and on social media with total disregard for staff morale and dismantling everything established over the past years. Staff are either forced to sing to the tune of the new leadership or shown to the door, resulting in competitive, destructive and toxic team culture internally. Hypocritical leadership at its best with their supporting clowns below sabotaging each other for own promotion and interest.\r\n\r\nHire and fire is in the DNA\r\nJobs of locals are ruthlessly made redundant during frequent transformations. Your role can be made redundant today but tomorrow your role re-appears in the job market in another form with slightly tweaked job scope and hiring will start once again but this time, likely taken by a foreigner. It\u2019s simply a convenient way of getting rid of those who dare speak up or with dissenting views.

Their only purpose is to milk the bank of its cash while not doing any work. All they do is (a) Talk at meetings without making sense, (b) try to steal your work and pass it off as their own (c) push emails around to 'coordinate' and seem like they are doing work.\r\n\r\n2) Which company has so many 'Head of XXX' and big inflated titles? I think SC has up to 75 CFOs and 30 COOs. One COO will manage 15 COOs...who in turn manage other COOs. (there's CIB COO, CFO COO, FM COO, FM Finacne COO, GB COO, GB ASA COO....etc etc) and this repeats for all the C-Suite functions. When these psudo C-Suite and peduso-Heads go out to market, they are laughed at. COO Salary at 1/20th the salary of a normal COO elsewhere? Have a laugh. They might have a Toilet CFO, Pantry CEO, Head of Meeting Rooms, MBFC Gantry CFO, ATM CFO, Email CFO etc. The common joke when someone is heading to SC is: \"oh, what department are you heading?\" - even for a fresh graduate.\r\n\r\n3) Many Senior Managers/ Middle Management are clueless about their role. They managed to secure their position by jumping internally to various other roles. Where clueless managers (who do not know what is needed) hire such clueless staff; who in turn also hire other clueless staff. The entire pyramid is rotten - nobody knows what is going on. Managers throw around big words like \"Big Data\" and \"Machine Learning\" and \"Unsupervised Learning\" while not know what they really are. Do simple balance sheet calculations seriously need big data and unsupervised learning? It's simple accounting! Worst thing is that their bosses are impressed, and themselves go about throwing these words around - as if it will solve the bank's problems. No amount of ML can help you if you do not even have proper data - its like trying to build a skyscraper using tissue paper. I daresay the entire chain relies on the poor fresh graduate at the bottom who tries to properly understand what the job is about. \r\n\r\n4) Staff in Singapore from certain other countries are rude and demeaning to the auxiliary staff in office - such as the cleaners, concierge, building services. They place used cups in the pantry, especting the cleaner to wash it for them. They leave food around, expecting the cleaner to clean up after them. Worst of all, if you have ever had the misforunte of working at their Changi Business Park office, you'll realise that there are humans in need of toilet training like infant animals! They do their business anywhere but into the toilet bowl, and pee all over the place. It is so bad that the building services team has asked the cleaning uncle to clean up every hour! Every. Single. Hour. The poor cleaning uncle has a torrid time.\r\n\r\n5) The bank's systems are archaic. Probably can't talk about it in specifity but you will realise you're better off with paper and pen.\r\n\r\n6) Last but not least, there is no accountability. Ineptitude, sloth, slipshod work, and even malfeasance is tolerated throughout the bank. Managers who do not deliver projects after asking for millions of dollars of funding are still around; their projects conveniently forgotten and written off. What they do is to find a new role within the bank, and chuck the project off into some god-forsaken hole. Individuals seem to be graded on how many times they have coffee/tea with their managers instead of quality of work. If you've had the misfortune to grace the canteen in Changi Business Park during a work-week, you'll realise that it is constantly packed throughout the day with people having 'coffee chats' (which is really just a secret language for malingering).\r\n\r\n--honestly, no consultant, system, way of working can fix the disaster that is Standard Chartered.

However, the range is also wide, so it boils down to how generous your boss is.\r\n- Work-life balance does exist, but there are some individuals who slog like slaves.\r\n- Most people enjoy the flexibility of working from home once in a while, as long as you deliver what is required.\r\n- Lots of leave for permanent employees.\r\n- No shortage of employee volunteering opportunities.\r\n- If you work in the city office, it's very accessible, but you will spend a lot of time and money on food and parking.\r\n- If you work in the changi office, there are more (affordable) lunch options compared to a couple of years ago, but it can be difficult getting to work if you miss the free company shuttle buses to Changi - unless you stay a couple of train stations away from Expo.\r\n- Medical benefits is ok, but not great when compared to other banks.\r\n- Group CEO is widely respected and revered.", "cons": "- Most of the middle managers, and some senior managers, seldom come across as impressive when it comes to their management style or expertise.\r\n- Too many people were hired just because they are friends with the hiring manager, and not because they are genuinely capable of what they do. If you want to shift to another role within the bank, you have to spend a lot of time and effort networking.\r\n- This bank is horribly, terribly disorganised, and many things are done last minute. This compromises the quality of work.\r\n- When it comes to new business opportunities or innovation in banking, they are always one step behind other banks.\r\n- Managers of south asian descent tend to hire people of the same race. Other people have also said that they generally have difficulty adapting to the working styles of other races.\r\n- There is a lot of shifting of tech & ops roles to South Asia for the sake of lowering costs. I personally think it's a recipe for disaster. Most of the time, the southern Asian counterparts are seriously lacking basic communication and listening skills. They are not efficient in delivering outcomes and many projects get delayed very badly. Project cost over-runs can get rather alarming. When they say \"yes, it's done\" or \"yes, it will be done\", it usually turns out to be the opposite. I don't believe it to be true for all south Asians, and there are exceptional cases within the bank (though very few), but such sentiments are echoed by many other non-south-Asians in the organisation.\r\n- Quite a lot of redundancies were made with the recent merger of its wholesale and consumer banking business. Sometimes these retrenchments happen so fast, it's just bollocks!\r\n- Since the merger, everything is in a state of confusion and semi-chaos because people are not sure where the company is heading, how they should navigate the organisation to get things done and how it impacts their promotion and pay. There has been little communicated to staff worldwide.\r\n- From time to time, you hear about women sleeping up the corporate ladder. And they still get away with it.\r\n- Didn't bother about the employee share options - doesn't seem attractive.\r\n\r\nAdvice to someone who is thinking of joining this organisation soon:\r\n- Wait for the dust of the recent reorganisation to settle first.
