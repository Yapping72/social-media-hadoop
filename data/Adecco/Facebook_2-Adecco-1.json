If the client you work for offers a company bonus to their employees- you're out-of-luck.\r\n-Very little communication from HR or others.  There are no emails to tell you what day Adecco will pay your check when it lands on a holiday, which could be a long weekend.\r\n-Probably one of the worst experiences is trying to contact a LIVE person at payroll and benefits to speak with.  I have held avg. of at least 15-20 minutes, and then hang-up.  However, I have been left on-hold for 1 hour in the automated queue.  No one ever picked up.  (It should not matter the time of year an employee calls-in, there should be someone to talk with during business hours, during the week.\r\n-There seems very little concern for their contractor staff.  In their policies and little concern shown to their contractors when contacted- you feel as if you have very little value to them.  You are expendable. They like the time you send-in your timesheet because then Adecco can bill the client and get paid. \r\n-Finally- realize that their policy of \"Paid-holiday\" is structured by design where I would bet very few reach their requirements to qualify.  And, they state they reserve the right to change or retract that said \"Paid-holiday\" at any time.  Here's why that matters--  A contractor with Adecco receives no opportunity to accrue \"personal leave, sick pay, or vacation pay.\" They do not pay if the client you are serving pays holiday pay to their staff. Keep in mind- most clients will close the building on a holiday.  So- that leaves the contractor losing a day(s) of pay.  The only way to make a full-week of pay is to find some off-hour time the client will allow you make it up.  So- as a contractor for Adecco-  you are royally screwed with their policies.  \r\n\r\nI have made attempts to contact the corporate office to address this concern to me, but they don't seem to care.  That's what you are dealing with when working with Adecco. \r\n\r\nI'll say it depends on your goals.  If you are a college student, or something looking to make some quick cash without benefits...its great.  If you think your client will hire you on full-time after a tour with Adecco...that's great!

The \"sick pay\" they were so proud of providing is just what is legally required by my state, they aren't really giving us anything they aren't forced to give us. No paid time off / vacation time. They - in theory - have holiday pay, but in reality it is so difficult to qualify for said holiday pay that I have never actually gotten it - nor has anyone I work with - even though I worked Thanksgiving and Christmas and will work New Years, I still haven't \"qualified\" for Holiday Pay and will only make my base rate for those days.

They changed their benefits enrollment period without giving us sufficient notice, so even if you had wanted to enroll they made that as difficult as possible.

God forbid you need representation during the assignment with which you are tasked.  I was recently on an assignment and had an issue with obtaining a contract termination date.  I explained this situation in a very detail-oriented manner with the representatives at Adecco and was given nothing useful in the way of feedback.  I was seeking assistance with this matter and basically received feedback saying there was nothing they could do, nothing they were going to do, and I was on my own.  I elected to end my contract on 01 FEB 2013 on my own accord citing these issues along with the fact that the position I filled with Adecco was initially described as being 1-3 month temp-to-hire, which needless to say, never occurred considering I remained a contractor through the end of the assignment despite many attempts to resolve this issue on my own, then as a last resort, seeking the representation of the contracting agency (Adecco) which I felt should have served on my behalf with the situation.\r\n\r\nWhen I presented the thought of escaping the assignment to obtain something with more of an opportunity of permanence, I was informed that despite what I had endured, nothing could be secured for me until the contract ended and if I wished to remove myself from the contract, I would need to supply 2 days' notice in order to be eligible for other assignments.  I met this criteria considering I supplied 3 days' notice (72 hours) and have contacted this agency 3 times in order to see if other assignments were available.  The last correspondence I sent was today, 12 FEB 2012.  I sent this directly to my staffing contact who placed me on the assignment and her manager.  Approximately an hour after sending this correspondence (none of the previous communications were returned), I received an email which I believe was sent erroneously to my address instead of the representative this was directly sent to and contained the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nerve of this guy  cannot believe it\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I'm beside myself.  This is a descriptor of how customer / client relations are trending in business nowadays.  It's very sad that when a legitimate concern is presented, this is the response that is received and that people within the Adecco agency speak ill of their contractors  such as this.  I have read some pretty negative reviews of Adecco's personnel, but never dreamed I would experience this firsthand.  I believe this is a clear indicator that there is no intention of this Adecco branch office to place me on future assignments."}], [{"review_title": "IT jobs", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 May 2015", "job_title": "Help Desk in Erie, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I had a recruiter that seemed genuinely interested in getting me jobs.", "cons": "Unfortunately, the jobs are strictly contracts.

They also quotted me the wrong amount for my hourly pay, so I was dissapointed when I recieved my first pay heck and discovered it was quiet a bit smaller than I'd been antisipating.  as much as I love my job now, if I'd have known the actual wage then, I doubt I would have accepted the offer.  \r\n\r\nMultiple times over the past year I have had my paychecks missed.  I have had to call and email every time for multiple days just to get a response.  And when I do, no one ever knows what's going on.  The worst example was when I had a missed paycheck for three weeks and was unable to get in touch with anyone despite leaving multiple voicemails and sending tons of emails to all the contacts I had.  They eventually called me back and 'apologized' that it had taken them so long to get back to me, saying that all of my voicemails were going to a phone they didnt use...i had been calling the number listed on there website and every employees email signiture, so I find that very odd.\r\n\r\nPerhaps part of their problem is that they cannot seem to keep anyone employed.  In the year that I have been with them I have had at least 5 or 6 different account managers come and go.  At this point I have no idea who my point of contact is.\r\n\r\nThe most recent example of their incompetence was just this week:  my job offered me a promotion.  Adecco contacted me and let me know and I told them I had several questions before I accepted.  Instead of answering my questions, they emailed my contingent labor group and told them I accepted, without ever even contacting me back!  It took me two days tp get through to then again that I needed my questions answered before I could accept anything.  I recieved one email saying they would look into it two days ago, and since then not a word, despite me attempting to contact them via phone and email multiple times.\r\n\r\nI know these people work on commision... i've worked on commision before too so I know the appeal of quickly closing a deal and moving on.
