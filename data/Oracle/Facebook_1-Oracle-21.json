It will take generally take 2-3 years before you get your first (minimal) raise and promotion.\r\n\r\nWhat is worse is the opportunity to gain knowledge. They might bring you in as a 'developer' but there is a good chance you won't actually develop. They will put you on testing or some sort of sysadmin role for one of their many products if they can get you on a project. And that is if you even get on a project. It is not uncommon for you to sit on the bench for upwards of 6-10 months your first year on the job. And after a month you will be frustrated because you just want to be useful. And none of this is useful when talking to other companies because they care less about testing experience or bench time and would rather see a product you have built. It is essentially an experience black hole unless you are working on your own side projects.\r\n\r\nAnd for 20%-40% this will lead to other things. They will get actual developing experience and maybe even get a promotion and start going up some sort of ladder before another company agrees to pay a lot more money for you.

ASR's spend almost 90% of their time cold calling and prospecting, with the other 10% doing paperwork for their field rep counterparts. I will say that ASRs can and do close their own deals. This is uncommon as many field reps can and will take every deal found by an ASR and work it themselves, leaving the ASR to do more prospecting and paperwork. As for metrics, ASRs are required to submit every single interaction they have with their customers, whether it's a phone call or email. This is not how sales should work.\r\n\r\nQuota's:\r\nQuota's are obtainable, but this requires a good territory that is performing, which is a flip of a coin. In my pillar, 85% of the ASR's did not hit their numbers and the ones who did either had a great field rep or they were in a great territory.\r\n\r\nCompensation:\r\nThe compensation is probably my biggest con with Oracle. When I was hired, I was told that I would reach my total compensation number (Base + Commission) if I hit 100% of my quota - sounds fair to me. But no, that is not realistic as after 1 week I received my commission rate, did some math, and realized if I hit 100% of my number I would only make about half of my total commission pay. This is the main reason I am writing this review, as I strongly feel that I was lied to by the hiring managers to get me on board. \r\n\r\nOverall, I would ONLY recommend the role of an ASR to recent college graduates to get good experience with a Fortune 100 company. If you're a current Oracle ASR reading this - my suggestion is to get 1-2 and then work hard to get into one of the up and coming cloud companies. If you are/were a sales representative for a good company and considering Oracle, please - do not bite on their compensation structure as it is very misleading.

Your first hike may itself get delayed by as much as 2.5-3.5 years or even beyond. Here are the reason:\r\n(i ) An employee not considered for the first hike after joining\r\n(ii) Hikes, in general, come one in 2 to 2.5 years (or more in troubled times)\r\n(iii) Not everyone gets a hike. The ratio is 70:30 or 60: 40 (So in a team of 10 employees, only about 6-7 get hike, 3-4 dont). Generally, new employees are targeted to deprive them of hikes, since they are still to prove themselves, but it also depends on the manager's favoritism. Remember if you miss an increment cycle then the next one comes only after 2-2.5+ years. So how much do you lag behind the market now?\r\n(iv) Even if you get a hike it is mostly a single digit (sometimes as low as 3-5%). But the company has manipulated everyone psychologically. For example, those getting a (minuscule) hike are so happy being considered for the hike that they forget that their peers in other companies getting much HIGHER increments EVERY year.\r\n(v) The company fires a number of employees just before the hikes, so even those employees that don't get hikes (some times for 5-7 years at a stretch) are happy to save their job. Working in Oracle for more than 3 years has already made you misfit for the world outside\r\n\r\n(3 The same above logic for Bonus and Shares. Mostly managers favorites ( mostly decided by the nationality/regional/language commonality) make it to the list..Other are filtered out from Bonus and Shares,\r\n\r\n(4) There are frequent job-losses, but they are managed smartly so it does not make it to the media. Only those figures where a country's government mandatorily requires retrenchment figures land in the press. (For example, say the companies have employees across 250  floors of office space globally with a seating capacity of 500 employees on each floor, and 50  people are retrenched  DAILY from random floors. Would anyone notice?  But what is the lay-off  figure for a month ? Especially since no communications are made to other employees, as most think that the employee is working from home.\r\n\r\n(5) While the old reviews may talk otherwise, but because of job-loss panic, there is no  work-life balance. In fact because of the  recent mass-scale job losses people volunteer to stretch themselves.\r\n\r\n(6) You are a misfit for the industry once you work here for more than 3 years. So you can take a clerical salary for the rest of your work-life and pray that you are not a victim of retrenchment in between...... It works this way- Despite aggressive press claims, the company lags behind in technology by 5-7 years from the industry. However, you cannot upgrade yourself by self-initiative either, since there is a heavy workload every day due to the panic over probable job-losses.  So each future year you are behind the industry further, leading to a VICIOUS Cycle..

I was lucky to have a good manager and team, but that doesn't mask the fact that 80% of my time was spent logging pointless \"interactions\" and bombarding customers with unwanted messaging/information. Calling fake companies and phone numbers to make your metrics look good is a very common practice. The amount of false information put into the system is unbelievable - I don't know how this company hasn't collapsed already. \r\n\r\nThere is also a very \"fratty\" culture. There were a few times I felt uncomfortable with the highly unprofessional conversations, and more than a few times where I felt uncomfortable at work because someone was make unwanted advances on myself or a female coworker.

Don't work here if you want your hard work to be reflected in the company. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the worst disappointment of all is the pay. Some people can make great money here, but they are very few and far between. The recruiters flat-out lied about how much money you can actually make, since commissions are pooled. If Oracle doesn't hit it's number (which it almost never does), you will NOT make your full commission or even sniff anything close. I consistently exceeded my number by almost double every quarter and hardly saw anything in commission. Management tries to justify poor commissions by saying \"it's fine, you're just learning and you'll be promoted in the year.\" The truth is, being promoted to a sales representative at Oracle is an even worse place to be in. Unless you have an extremely lucky territory or fall into a deal cycle, you risk not closing anything for your first year (or more). This means you will be living on your base salary of $53,000 with no hope for commission.

It's a HUGE lottery.", "cons": "I\u2019ve never seen a corporation like this. Let\u2019s try to be objective and go through this step-by-step:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tGetting to Oracle: scam\r\nTheir recruiters are like a huge propaganda department. Someone from some place will contact you by phone, tell you they have a golden opportunity for you and they will invite you to an \u201cassessment center\u201d. They\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s better to do it ASAP as it\u2019s \u201cone of the last\u201d to take place (actually they take place every month or so). You will have to do a PowerPoint (why me, why oracle, why this job) and you have to sell yourself. Basically most of the people in the assessment center get an offer, half of the time if people don\u2019t join it\u2019s because they refuse.\r\nNote: If you\u2019re lucky enough to belong to a strong market (Dutch, German or Scandinavian...), you probably will be able to skip that and be recruited directly through the phone or almost, it happened sometimes.\r\nBeware to have correct data on your resume as they check through their screening partner. Don\u2019t be too excited about their relocation package, because they will hunt you down if you want to leave to pay it back.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tStarting at Oracle: DIY\r\nSo, you come at your desk, they give you a laptop, a to-do-list, and here you go, it\u2019s all about DIY. Self-service pushed to the extreme. Nobody tells you if what to do is right, but they will tell you if it\u2019s wrong. No real on-boarding plan, you spend 3 weeks watching videos and you have to order your own screens, mouse, keyboard etc.\r\nYou probably won\u2019t even know in which team you belong to nor meeting your manager before a few days for those who are lucky, and it can take a whole quarter to get a team \u2013 they call it \u201coverhires\u201d. You\u2019re a collateral damage of Oracle Direct strategy. It\u2019s not your fault but that\u2019s the way it is.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tTraining at Oracle: Going away to the college\r\nOk so after your 3 weeks of watching random videos. You have their 2 weeks on-site training in fancy hotels with people coming from Dubai, Malaga, Berlin, Prague\u2026 it\u2019s cool to meet those people. The first week is a training (boring) about sales techniques, and the one-man-show of some american salesguy who teaches you how to cold-call in such a way it would portray Barack Obama as an introvert. Not very applicable elsewhere than in Texas or LA..\r\nThe second week you have presentations to do (individual or group presentations), assessments consisting of a sales call with a scenario.\r\n\r\nThis was back in the days, now it consists of 4 weeks in a remote place in Kildare where you have to come every day (3 hours driving in and out) where you have to make presentations every weeks in front of your group (120 people attend it) and you\u2019re put under pressure for these 4 weeks as there are different tiers (Q1 / Q2 / Q3 / Q4) and from this grading system your evolution will depend a lot. As you\u2019re back in school, you have presentations to prepare in the evening for the day after so you won\u2019t finish off before 9 or 10 pm actually.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWorking at Oracle: Hardcore\r\n\r\nWell\u2026 for those who have a manager or a territory from the beginning, which is basically the purpose they were hired, lucky them. For the other over-hires\r\nTheir CRM is very slow, messy, not intuitive and too much data are duplicated. It\u2019s hard to have 360 view on what's going on in your territory / deals.\r\nThe sales processes are VERY LONG but it\u2019s not much because of the negotiation / implementation timeframe. Salespeople are fighting internally 90% of the time than against the customers to get discounts from the teams in the states who don\u2019t understand that the products are way above the average in terms of price and there\u2019s a discount in most of the time to get a sell, probably more than 50% or even 60% in many cases.\r\nOracle is an American company and they are worried about their \u201cbranding\u201d and legal issues. When an executive made awkward comments about minorities for joking in a conference, he was quickly urged to apologize for his \u201csense of humor\u201d, blaming his personality, so let's say they have some issues sometimes but they try to fix it.\r\nThe management is inexistent: the company is suffering from its gigantism. Nobody really knows what\u2019s going on and each zone/country/department/team/manager and everybody has a little piece of the puzzle. \r\nWe\u2019ve seen executives being deposed from their position to lower because of the mess created by the wave of resignations, paired with the lack of power to motivate or keep their employees. They always talk about the money, money, MONEY you could make, but they still don\u2019t understand that the targets are unreachable for most of the people except some lucky ones and they lost the trust from their employees and are not credible, or even well-liked\u2026 at all.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCareer Evolution\r\n\r\nManagers don\u2019t have power except to annoy you for your KPIs, they won\u2019t help you in designing your career path or go to the frontline to get more realistic targets. They are obeying to those above etc. and don\u2019t even have more visibility on what\u2019s going on than their subordinates.\r\nIf you lick the right person\u2019s boots, you can be sure it will pay off almost all of the time, even if you\u2019re not skilled in your job. It\u2019s all about credibility and people don\u2019t check so far the words of the others. It\u2019s easy to smoke managers or others about someone\u2019s performance or suitability for a role.\r\nOracle is a giant and they are really proud, if not arrogant about that. Such as their CEO, they love to split on the competitors. Most of the income of Oracle comes from their databases business and they are lacking in so many areas that they counterbalance it with the cash flow they invest and companies they acquire. So they will make you believe it\u2019s the time to be in the company (like all the companies do), they will invite the press and even politics to show how many new openings they are responsible of. But they won\u2019t tell that the turnover is just impressive because of the lack of perspectives and work conditions.\r\nIf you want to evolve at Oracle, you must leave and come back, they even encourage people to do so they come back with a stronger knowledge and network in exchange of a higher position or paycheck. In the meantime, if you want to work hard and reap the rewards of their work, just go on your way.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tLeaving Oracle\r\n\r\nThat's a delicate situation. Many people want to leave actually but they feel stuck because of the relocation package they have to payback (see above in the starting at oracle). Many want to get dismissed and avoid this + get a little money while looking after new jobs. They create and kill jobs and still recruit people but there is not enough place for everybody. that's non-sense. Many people don't dare to tell to the recruiters what's going on because people feel embarassed and ashamed of being victim of such a mess, and this is probably their fault if they're not good enough to hit unrealistic targets (according to the management).
