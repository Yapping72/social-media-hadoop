I have been with Oracle for over a decade. I write this to give potential candidates a real look into the company. Someone who has been with the company 12-24 months may not have a very wide view since you are required to stay in a position for a year and people rarely leave their area. I have worked in several different areas in my time at the company. I came on as part of an acquisition. You will see folks who give good ratings and approve of the CEO, but it\u2019s really good to check to see how long they\u2019ve been there as Oracle will not show all their cards up front. That typically doesn\u2019t happen until you\u2019re in there a few years. Good Luck! \r\n\r\nTraining & Development \u2013 In my almost 20 years here, I have never witnessed any dedicated employee development. Part of management's job is to develop their employees, but that is completely non-existent. In the Global Business Units (GBU's) it's even worse. Oracle's latest \u201cemployee development\u201d program literally has employees filling out word docs about their goals and such. Basically what people did in 1999. As for actual training, for the courses someone might need to improve in their jobs or become more skills, Oracle will charge you thousands of dollars to take them. In my years here, I had one training course that my unit paid for. With the advent of the cloud, you are able to get access to subscription learning. These are setup as videos for the most part, so you're just watching powerpoint slides go by and once you're done, there's no real reinforcement. In my time here I have not watched one person be developed from a hire to employee to management. Usually in a decade you would have one or two examples of progression. \r\n\r\nSalaries & Raises \u2013 I know of a person who was recently asked to transfer teams, but they originally thought it was a promotion and then told it was not. The person transferred teams and then was asked to apply for the position. The departments are basically doing anything underhanded they can to save money and they do not care if people leave. People are leaving my unit in droves. There is a ton of managers who are just flat out leading people on. And as many have mentioned here, the lowest in the industry. If you are considering this company as a place of employment, negotiate as high as you can. In our unit of thousands of people, there have been people who have not even gotten a cost of living raise in 5-10 years. Managers, as well as directors, are pretty spineless and won\u2019t stick up for anyone. I have watched people get lied to about money, I have watched colleagues be sold one job and think they were getting their \u201clevel\u201d raise only for the manager to remove the job and create another job that was a lateral move. You are around some really scummy low down people. This is not like the big and successful tech companies. This is basically the lowest end of tech. With that being said, you need to do something remarkable to get any type of raise. You need to really beat everyone on your team and basically be perfect for 12 months. And even then, quite the stretch. And they\u2019ll tell you, \u201cthat\u2019s all we could get from management. Be happy you got anything at all.\u201d I have heard directly from someone who was protected that when they contacted HR about the \u201cpromotion\u201d that actually had them making less money, the HR person said, \u201cyou should just be happy you got a promotion.\u201d Management that are friends with other managers will also have an impact on those things. I have gotten raises in my time here, but with salaries being so low, it's not a lot. As mentioned before, if you get in via an acquisition, you could get a nice bump from what you were making, but that's up for negotiation between Oracle and the old company. \r\n\r\nWork-Life Balance \u2013 The single reason I have heard anyone stays here is because they can work from home and get their work done in 4-5 hours a day. That's really the biggest benefit of the company and don't think anyone would argue. \r\n\r\nManagement \u2013 Lead with talent and qualifications and not who your buddy was at a partner/acquisition/high school/pre school. There are many thick and useless layers of management. Many of them with very little technology and or real IT experience. When Oracle acquires smaller companies, if they are under the GBU framework, the company can basically say, a janitor is now a Senior Director and no questions are asked. I have watched scores of people come in that way and just leapfrog over people who have been in the unit for decades. It's even more embarrassing when the people who have been there basically know 10 times more about everything and the new member of management just sits around being social and not really contributing. I've also never seen the same members of management sit in the same exact positions for decades. These managers stay in office longer than presidents. Their attitudes are smug and many are downright hated by their team members. The thing is, you work in a tech company and you should know the buzz words or at least know what they mean. I have been in meetings where a director actually said to someone two levels below them that, \u201cthat's not their job to know how to do this or that...that's on you to know...\u201d At Oracle, as opposed to many other companies I have worked at, to be in management, you do not need to have been good at any one particular job or the jobs of your team. It is truly amazing. My thought is they stay because no companies really want them. \r\n\r\nThe Cloud \u2013 applications on the cloud were deployed with very little strategy or education to the employees. They will never catch the other tech companies that are staffed with better talent and management. Management wants to tout the cloud as being a success, but it's basically because customers are basically strong-armed into going to it and they are flat out lied to when speaking about the overall performance of the cloud. There is also a mentality among management and long time employees that Oracle is better than Amazon. Anyone who knows the tech sector right now, knows that's laughable. At Oracle, they can't even speak about their competition because they're getting beaten so bad. What's worse is that there are smaller companies that are now coming up that have better products, better platforms, cheaper price and less problems."}], [{"review_title": "Great place for Sales", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "29 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Sales Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very sales-focused culture, lots of resources available to help you sell", "cons": "Very high demands of sales execs, high pressure environment, relatively high turnover in sales leadership"}, {"review_title": "Awesome company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everything is fine here and work culture is too good as well.", "cons": "I haven't found any cons here till now."}, {"review_title": "Great Work Life Balance, Slow Growth", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "8 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Principal Product Manager in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very less hierarchy\nGreat Work Life Balance\nHigh EQ in Management", "cons": "Ownership of product is limited and hence slower, limited learning and hence slower growth.\nTech Driven and not product management driven.\nYearly compensation hikes are not up to mark."}, {"review_title": "Big brand and excellent work life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "15 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Principal QA Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Big brand and excellent work life balance", "cons": "They do not value existing employees salary package wise."}, {"review_title": "Culture is awesome.

Sometimes overtime is needed but even then they won't approve it unless it is a critical situation, and what you and I consider critical and what the customers consider critical usually doesn't fit the criteria. The situation has to be at catastrophic levels before such things are approved. \n\nThe training really is terrible. I was told by my friend not to worry about it, that 'you will learn your job when you do your job'. Not even that was true. Everyone I knew was frustrated, with few exceptions. I asked one gal how she knew what she was doing, as she was helping me, and she said she had a degree in databases. Those that know what they are doing were spread so thin.\n\nFrom what I saw they really don't care about their customers. I could spend an hour writing up a bug and then another hour going over it with my mentor. He knew what he was doing, but told me, yeah, they're still going to ____ and say it's not good enough. That was typical. Once in a meeting, two weeks after I had filed a bug, the developer discussed it with me and I had to explain to him what was wrong and why it was important to the customer. All of this I had written in the bug but he hadn't even read it. I also asked him for an ETA on a bug and he never replied. I asked in the bug, I asked by email, he just ghosted me. I even sent a message to his manager. No luck. I was floored by the lack of concern for a customer, especially as we went through five one hour sessions to train us to bend over backwards for them. On top of this, I eventually found an ETA listed in the bug and told the customer, and the developer chastised me very sternly for doing this. I tried to ask him how I was supposed to talk to him and get an ETA and he avoided the question by chastising me more - basically gaslighting me for trying to help a customer. \n\nSo much of the documentation is incomplete. If you've never used the system before it's impossible to navigate from the instructions given. So much of my time was wasted trying to accomplish step 3 in a list of directions when it should have been step 4 or 5. At that there were very few people I could ask questions of. My manager encouraged my mentor to shut me out unless it was our scheduled call. She told me I was expected to train myself. To me there is no excuse for this. Even with customizations, the documentation should be at or near complete, in many cases it was nonexistent and sometimes google was better than our knowledge base. It was so frustrated because I went in ready to work hard and learn, and help customers. I have been a rock star at this type of work in other positions but with no support I was just frustrated. I tried to document whatever I could so others could learn, but I could only learn what others were willing to teach me, or what I could glean from other SRs and incomplete documentation. Everyone is spread so thin - and then they laid a bunch of us off because we only had 11 service requests at a time. A lot of the verbiage in the documentation was also very hard to read because Oracle hires a lot of non-native speakers, so adding that into having it incomplete just added to my frustration, but the biggest shock to me was the attitude towards the customers. I told a senior engineer that a situation was embarrassing and he told me that if I was embarrassed about that I would be embarrassed all the time. Well, yes, I was until I just had to take the 'not my circus, not my monkeys' approach. But I would have loved to be able to take some ownership and have that matter. That's what I set out to do but was thwarted at every turn. Try as I might, I couldn't learn much, couldn't change much and couldn't help much, and that was demoralizing as I've always prided myself on having the customer's back, as well of that of my teammates, but at Oracle, nobody had mine. \n\nI'll just mention too that having to drive into the office and getting sick because others were sick was silly. Most of the people I needed to interact with were in other offices across the country, so I was just sitting there with people who couldn't help me.\n\nAnother frustration was that a manager there would always look at me like I was disgusting if I didn't wear makeup. If I had dressed up and looked gorgeous she was fine but if I wasn't, she would make a face like I had just puked or something. It was really humiliating. \n\nMy manager admitted that she can be a _____ sometimes, like she was not ashamed of it. Unfortunately I was on the receiving end of that and HR knows all about it. They tried to put the blame on me, but I helped them see reason, at least enough that while they said they wanted to continue our discussions, they never scheduled another meeting.\n\nI've since heard that my team was very overloaded and many of them have left, which is a shame because it takes 3-4 years for a person to get comfortable, from what I am told. \n\nThey also said one of senior management was asking if they were all helping each other to get their queues down. I think most people can understand that if each rep has 96 service requests at any given time, helping each other is going to do little to reduce that number. If one person has that many, others can help bring it down by sacrificing some work on their own queues, but when it's everyone, it seems pretty juvenile for someone to suggest such a thing, and it makes me think that guy obviously isn't being paid the big bucks because he earned his position. It's their own fault for laying off a bunch of people. There was plenty of work, they need lots of documentation and I was more than willing to do that as much as I could and to update the current documentation. I had hoped when I started and saw the state the documentation was in, that I could update it and make it easy for anyone to follow, but that soon became a pipe dream. I wrote lots of documents, but not near as many as I could have if someone had been willing to train me and if my teammates had not been stretched so thin. Definitely did not anticipate being laid off under these circumstances.\n\nAlso about the developers - even my manager said that the developers my team was working with had bad attitudes and were some of the worst she's seen at Oracle.\n\nOne more example, everyone talked in generalities. Go tell the customer to do this. In one case a senior engineer told me that and I said okay, I don't know how to do that, I can't find instructions, can you give me navigation steps? He ghosted me. I tried to ask again, still nothing, not ever. Sure enough the customer asked for navigation steps and berated me for not giving them in the first place, but there was nothing I could do. I'm told the customer should have known, but that makes me feel pretty silly asking them to do something I can't. I often learned things by watching the customers during zoom calls, they knew more than I did.
