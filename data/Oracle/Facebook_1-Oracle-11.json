They randomly place BDCs into different lines of business, which end up having different pay structures. You will find yourself making more or less than someone who applied to the same role (regardless of performance). They will promise you $25k of performance-based compensation and tell you that you will get it if you hit your number during recruiting. You will end up attaining over 200% of your quota and not make full bonus. They will tell you that you can promote quickly. You will soon find out that \"promotion\" means getting a slightly (and I mean slightly) higher base and new title to do the same job after a year of being a BDC - if you are lucky. The road to the top at Oracle is endless.\r\n\r\nOutside of the external competitors (who have far superior products than Oracle) you will also find yourself calling against many other teams within Oracle. This creates many confused and angry clients when you do get them on the phone or email. The training organization neglects giving you a complete understanding of the products you sell, but instead focuses on teaching you how to be manipulative and lie on the phone. The KPI structure for making bonus is nothing but subjective busy work. An \"opp\" does not come down to what you discover at an account, but how lenient your assigned Account Manager is.\r\n\r\nIn summary, you have no control over your destiny here. I am familiar with the common pitfalls of Corporate America. At Oracle, it is different. Leaving this company was the best decision I could have made.
