In sales, you have to be prepared to develop your network, identify your own career ambitions and make things happen, although there are plenty of people and tools to help you if you are self motivated to do that. It can be hard when you first join to \"find your place\" - the scale of the company and the number of people who work predominantly from home and who are not around much face to face, can make it hard to settle in. But if you value flexibility and being trusted to get the job done in the way you think best, then Oracle could be a good option for you.", "cons": "For me there are two main downsides - first, a lack of annual pay rises (you must negotiate a good salary to start with as that is your strongest bargaining position and you may go several years without a pay rise once you are in) and secondly the challenges presented by the transition from being an on premise to a cloud company which is definitely proving quite tough in some areas. There are numerous inefficient processes, some product challenges and many cultural changes to be made.

Career development is a joke.  In my years at Oracle I have never once been asked how management was doing - likely because they knew the answer is that management is horrific.  I've gone entire months with maybe 6 conversations with a manager who sat 50 feet away from me.  There is zero calculation of potential market in a territory when they set quotas, so it's the luck of the draw - either you get lucky and get a territory that prints money, or you get a territory where Gordon Gekko himself couldn't hit.  This is why you see some people sitting on their butt year after year and hitting their number, and other territories just chew up and spit out hardworking reps quarter after quarter, with turnover every year.  Naturally management never takes responsibility for this, because they spend all their time CYA to make sure that they can scapegoat their direct reports. Customers are treated like the enemy, deals are created by financial engineering instead of providing actual value to customers, and then collections is litigated by Oracle's vaunted team of compliance and attorneys."}, {"review_title": "Great company!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer In Test in Makati City", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Work-Life Balance\r\n- Offers many great opportunities \r\n- Great employee benefits", "cons": "Nothing I can think of."}, {"review_title": "The company makes you deliver your best", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "4 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Trainee in S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Open environment, competitive, innovative, growing fast", "cons": "Politics are important to be noticed and promoted"}, {"review_title": "Well organized and clear direction", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "28 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Test Automation Engineer in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Clear direction from management, and nice team actually try to help each other.", "cons": "Parking around Cambridge can be expensive"}, {"review_title": "Oracle IT Rarely Gives Raises", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "20 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Senior Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good company to work for, with great benifits.", "cons": "Oracle IT Rarely Gives Raises.

However, the bonus fund was rumored to be just 2.5%, so pretty much nobody got any bonus this summer. Sometimes I have a feeling that there is an implicit contract between the workforce and the management, like \"you don't overpay, we don't overwork\". Perhaps it's an ideal place to be when you are close to retirement, but not if you are relatively young and ambitious.\r\n\r\nAlso, one less obvious downside of such a \"socialist economy\" is that it seems to be resistant to changes/improvements. If you are creative, the lack of pressure from the management may actually help you to invent something - but once you try to promote that thing, add it to some product, etc., you may well feel (mostly silent) resistance and eventually get nowhere. It looks like even a minor cross-team technical advance is impossible unless there is some Vice President who decides to drive the whole thing.\r\n\r\nSo overall, I am rather skeptical about the future of this company or whether I want to be here in 2 or 3 years.

In a nutshell the challenges will come from the following: Acquiring 43 companies in three years does not come without complexities.
