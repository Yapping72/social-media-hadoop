From my vantage point Oracle's biggest weaknesses are 'Strategic Thinking\" and \"Innovation\"). As a serial acquirer they have made huge investments in PeopleSoft, Siebel, JD Edwards, BEA Systems, Hyperion, NetSuite, Sun Micro Systems and the latest big buy, CERNER the strong #2 in Healthcare -- Why not Epic the Leader? Oracle has bought many businesses over the years - They might integrate these cash cows into the business - but they will languish and in almost all cases lack the innovative capabilities that they acquired. Net-Net: if you want to work for a strong large firm that is a player in the Top-10 Technology Providers - Oracle will provide a good place to work. If you are looking for an innovative tech company that values people..... You might want to look somewhere else. Advice: If you are under <40: Look somewhere else for employment. If you are over >40: Oracle is a good weigh station to learn some new skills - But don't stop looking for stronger opportunities and move on quickly."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Cloud Trial Specialist in Redwood City, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Company, Good management, Dynamic Team", "cons": "Constantly Changing metrics, Silo'd teams"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "4 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Sr. Instructional Designer in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Its a structured and process oriented company Great work life balance", "cons": "Not a lot of opportunity for promotion"}], [{"review_title": "Exceptionally good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Senior Applications Engineer in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance No Micro management", "cons": "No Hikes Legacy technologies Customized frameworks"}, {"review_title": "A lot to learn !!!", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Functional Consultant in Bucharest, Bucuresti", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good learning for carrier boost", "cons": "Small salaries and high KPI\u2019s targets"}, {"review_title": "Sales", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Director in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company Greater people Amazing package overall", "cons": "I can think of any"}, {"review_title": "About a team in OCI", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Challenging work\r\nFlexibility can work remotely.\r\nSmart people around", "cons": "You will find arrogant/aggressive/loud people in leadership roles.\r\nManagers shouting at you, and making racial comments for trivial things like slow internet is standard here, if you suggest that you find that inappropriate then you will be asked to develop a thick skin.\r\nIf you ask questions you will be told that you ask \"support-like questions\" and are too dumb to understand anything.

The training is not relevant to the day-to-day function of the role and doesn't prepare you for the job or roles that follow. The employee retention rate is dropping rapidly because all sales reps at NetSuite are severely underpaid compared to competitors offering double pay for the same work. Because there's so much employee turnover, it's not uncommon to get assigned a new manager every 2 quarters which makes it challenging to continue training and to do well. Management does not respect employees and will openly treat people poorly if they are not in the top 10%. If management wants something done, they incentivize with threats instead of benefits or encouragement. If you have the option, avoid this role at all costs.
