They are also a go-between - between you and upper management. They are somewhat ineffectual as they don't have any real control over anything. (For example, when a bunch of employees were laid off during Covid, my immediate manager told our group that he was not informed that there were going to be layoffs until the day it happened - in other words - upper management made the decision on which people were being let go - not the immediate managers.)\r\n\r\nWork/Life balance is great. As an engineer when you leave work - you don't get called about work, or asked to work over time (they don't like to give over time and as an engineer you are paid hourly not salary.) Occasionally you are on call - but you get paid a flat rate for being on call (even if you don't get called) and then if you actually have to work you get paid for the time you had to work on top of the flat rate.\r\n\r\nOracle is AWESOME for having a diverse culture (people come from all over to work at Oracle). They support LGBTQ initiatives as well as veterans. I love working there because of the people I meet and work with from all over the world. They are very liberal in these kinds of policies - which is great.\r\n\r\nOracle has great health benefits and there is no max sick leave. (Though they do monitor how much sick leave you take.) For managers there is no max on vacation leave.\r\n\r\nOracle provides free drinks (coffee, sodas, tea (hot/cold and soda water). And when we were in the office (pre-covid) they did periodically provide lunches and other food. Though this wasn't very often.", "cons": "I have worked for Oracle for 6 years and I got a raise for the first time about a year ago. Oracle DOES NOT give yearly raises to offset the cost of living. They give something called Focals and you have to prove to your manager as well as upper management that you deserve to get a focal. You prove this by going above and beyond your job description. In other words, you have to be seen and known by upper management for the things you do at Oracle that are outside of your job description. Focals are also not given each year as they are dependent on the stock market.\r\n\r\nJob security is also not something Oracle offers. During Covid, Oracle laid off a number of people. You would think that they would lay off the people who had been hired most recently - but a large percentage of the people laid off during covid were long time employees who had worked there for 10+ years.\r\n\r\nOracle also has way too many meetings that just waste your time. The biggest offenders of this are the 'all hands' meetings that are required attendance.\r\n\r\n401K matching is not as high as I have had it at other companies.\r\n\r\nI currently work 12 noon to 8PM and get a 10% shift differential on top of my base pay for working those hours. However, Oracle recently announced that they are moving this shift to Mexico (where it is cheaper) and all of us working this shift will have to move to the 7 AM shift - which DOES NOT come with a 10% shift differential and Oracle has told us that we will have to work this earlier shift AND lose the 10% pay at the same time.

As an account manager, leadership often told us to just ignore the gripes or try to figure out how to push that to the bottom of your priority list.

A lot of funds are invested into the 3 month long training program which other companies don't have the means of doing. After working for Oracle for 6 months, recruiters will be sliding into your LinkedIn dms often. You really do learn the basics of selling and the sales process.\r\n\r\nThe BDC position is pretty chill, as long as you hit your metrics for the week, you're solid and management will stay off of your back. Your schedule is up to you to make even though you are expected to at least have access to your laptop between 9-5. Early fridays out are not promoted, but if your manager is chill you can be out of there/offline by lunch.\r\n\r\nPay is mediocre, not as great as other tech companies. Benefits are pretty solid and there are opportunities to invest in the company.\r\n\r\nThe BDC program is mainly composed of young people straight out of college. This is a pro and a con, a pro because it is easy to connect and make friends if you share the same interests. \r\n\r\nOverall accept the job for the NAME or if you are truly interested in a long term sales career (use the second line in your interview regardless).", "cons": "Each pro has a counterpart con.\r\n\r\nOracle is a great name to have on your resume because it is a monster tech company. Due to the size, you simply are just another replaceable number. \r\n\r\nThe training program is 3 months long and teaches the basics of sales, not Oracle technology, but sales. Don't get me wrong, there are a few weeks (1-2) where tech is the main focus, but there is so much tech lingo thrown around that it's difficult to catch on to what all of it means. The exam at the end of training is pretty easy, but a lot of people just crammed the information that was taught over the course of a few monstrous tech sessions.\r\n\r\nThe BDC position is a glorified secretary position combined with beginner sales. Daily routine consists of sending mass emails pertaining to Oracle events & updates, then cold calling people - half the numbers won't work because the information in our customer system is outdated. When a customer does answer the phone, you are not making a sale, you are selling a meeting to them so your sales rep can make a sale, but this is expected as this is a beginner sales job. Quantity is held above quality because after outreach there is little time left between meetings and trainings to prospect for new contacts and update the existing information.

A lot of funds are invested into the 3 month long training program which other companies don't have the means of doing. After working for Oracle for 6 months, recruiters will be sliding into your LinkedIn dms often. You really do learn the basics of selling and the sales process.\r\n\r\nThe BDC position is pretty chill, as long as you hit your metrics for the week, you're solid and management will stay off of your back. Your schedule is up to you to make even though you are expected to at least have access to your laptop between 9-5. Early fridays out are not promoted, but if your manager is chill you can be out of there/offline by lunch.\r\n\r\nPay is mediocre, not as great as other tech companies. Benefits are pretty solid and there are opportunities to invest in the company.\r\n\r\nThe BDC program is mainly composed of young people straight out of college. This is a pro and a con, a pro because it is easy to connect and make friends if you share the same interests. \r\n\r\nOverall accept the job for the NAME or if you are truly interested in a long term sales career (use the second line in your interview regardless).", "cons": "Each pro has a counterpart con.\r\n\r\nOracle is a great name to have on your resume because it is a monster tech company. Due to the size, you simply are just another replaceable number. \r\n\r\nThe training program is 3 months long and teaches the basics of sales, not Oracle technology, but sales. Don't get me wrong, there are a few weeks (1-2) where tech is the main focus, but there is so much tech lingo thrown around that it's difficult to catch on to what all of it means. The exam at the end of training is pretty easy, but a lot of people just crammed the information that was taught over the course of a few monstrous tech sessions.\r\n\r\nThe BDC position is a glorified secretary position combined with beginner sales. Daily routine consists of sending mass emails pertaining to Oracle events & updates, then cold calling people - half the numbers won't work because the information in our customer system is outdated.
