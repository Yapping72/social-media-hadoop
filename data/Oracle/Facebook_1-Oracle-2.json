I know most people can get their work done in 4 hours or less. Rarely working at all on Fridays. Great place if you have a side hustle. Never feel bad about taking time off here.\n-In my experience the quota pressure is year-over-year and not month-over-month which offers reduced pressure on reps", "cons": "Can't really share anything that hasn't been shared yet. It's funny going back over reviews from 2016 and realizing how little has changed. Here's my two cents after 5 years:\n\n-Customers are SO unhappy. Finding a reference is impossible. It's really a corporate strategy - get them on Oracle and then they're stuck.\n\n-Delivery of our products is awful. Partner network to implement ERP/SCM/HCM is a joke. They pass around failed implementations to one another; it's an achievement if a customer ever reaches go-live on just basic stuff. A majority of customers i've sold to never went live on our software. \n\n-Delivery part two: if you're the sales rep/AE, you're also customer support/customer success/implementation project manager/etc. We leave our customers to completely fend for themselves after buying. \n\n-Base pay raises are non-existent, even for top performers. Top top top performing AEs might get an extra 2 or 3 grand a year; even then that's really lucky and rarely seen. Presidents club recognition? Nothing - 40 billion dollar company can't expense one trip to recognize top performers. You might get a $100 starbucks gift card.\n\n-It's entirely luck of the draw if you'll make your number or not. From SMB to upmarket. I'll be honest- that's why i've stuck around as long as I have, I've been very fortunate here. Countless others are left with 15 sales accounts that have blocked every Oracle email address or are threatening to sue us. Note - It's really astounding how many companies are threatening to sue us. \n\n-Hilarious micro-managing of fake pipeline, fake dials, fake everything. And this comes from the TOP of management. \n\n-VPs reporting to other VPs who also report to their VP and then pass along reports to their VP to meet up with their VP and VPs and VP\u2014\n\n-another note: BDR program /\"Class Of\" is really what you make of it. I've seen rockstars come out of there but it's truly fend for yourself. The current management over there is a complete joke.\n\n-The fiscal year shake-up which everyone here has already talked about. Oracle hires more reps every year, reduces the size of your territory, has no continuity with customers. It's a total wasteland. Often this means Q1 from june-august is a complete wash with no work getting done while we wait for proper territories/comp plans/etc. Good or bad depending on how you look at that.\n\n-Turnover in the solution engineering org is awful. All the hard working and knowledgable SEs left for competitors because they were drastically underpaid here. It's been a problem for years but never addressed. That means getting demos together can take weeks if not months. \n\n-Management is definitely a boys club, frighteningly non-diverse"}, {"review_title": "Flexible work culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Software Developer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Never received no for a leave request Very good learning across different teams", "cons": "Work could sometimes become too much"}, {"review_title": "NA", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Information Security Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to work ...", "cons": "It all depends on the manager you work fo"}], [{"review_title": "NA", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Information Security Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to work ...", "cons": "It all depends on the manager you work fo"}, {"review_title": "Not good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "17 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Cloud Architect in Seoul", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "can take work life balance.", "cons": "Only db engineers are treated"}, {"review_title": "Overall Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Senior Consultant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work Life balance Gaining knowledge", "cons": "No cons that i can thing of"}, {"review_title": ".", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Consultant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible, stable, reliable, supportive, collaborative", "cons": "Stress, Pressure, Challenge, Tough, Time"}, {"review_title": "Oracle apps DBA", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Oct 2022", "job_title": "\"ORACLE DBA\"", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Providing great services through their technologies", "cons": "Obviously, this company has a great reputation as an innovator and leader in the industry.

If you want to really rise, quit the company go to a client or competitor and become a VP, or senior VP then Oracle will hire you back as a VP. \r\n\r\nCulture is of great infighting between different groups. Not of unity and collaboration and harmony but of jealousy and vindictiveness. I was pretty sure that was never the intention of senior management, but they were either never aware of this problem or if they are aware they do not know how to bring people together and make them as one people.\r\n\r\nGreat technical ideas and innovations are shot down by lower, and middle management with an excuse we don\u2019t have time for this. So great ideas and visions never reach senior management. That is probably a problem for most large companies.\r\n\r\nCertainly a lot of people people with egos much bigger than than their brains work here.

If you come up with a great idea. You might get a nasty email from your manager saying you don\u2019t know \u2014- a couple of bad curse words. And a couple days later you will see your slides in presentation of CTO with credits going to that same manager . Please have courtesy to simply thank people who really did the work even if you want to take credit for it.\r\n\r\nThat brings me no the next thing the use of curse words was very common.
