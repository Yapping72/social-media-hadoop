One month the goal is to close service requests and write good notes, the next is to make sure there are no calls in queue and then you are harassed if you're on a call too long. Like we want to be on a long call? Direction contradicts itself.\r\n Worst part is they fired our manager who was a 11-year dedicated and educated manager. They fired him because of political reasons and was completely unreasonable. If they are willing to fire a 11-year manager, shows you how much they value their employees. And yes, I am aware of ALL the details of the firing. \r\nMost tech companies value their employees more than the product and this is not the case here. \r\nUpper management (not in Utah) is uneducated in management and have archaic methods. \r\n Training was not provided at all on the product.
