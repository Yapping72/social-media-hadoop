You can google it and it would be the top result. The average length of employees is around 2-3 years because they realized.. wow it is true. Time to find a better paying job. I have seen ex-coworkers get 40% raises by accepting outside jobs. I did the same. \r\n\r\nWhat's maddening is when I discussed pay with a peer.. I discovered that as a new hire..

Started in the Class Of program when it included a trip to California. The company did a great job of introducing everyone to tech sales. Pre-Covid, Class Of was a good way to make friends and score some freebies. \r\n\r\nThe people are one of Oracle's best assets. It's easy to network and make friends since most people are willing to help and don't act too pretentious.\r\n\r\nYou get to choose from a number of locations across the country. However, salaries are fixed so your dollar will probably go farther in Austin than in Santa Monica.\r\n\r\nBonuses/Commission rates used to be better and promotions used to be plentiful. It was fairly common for a BDC to get promoted to a closing role after 1+ year in seat. Wasn't unheard of for recent college graduates to be making close to 6 figures.\r\n\r\nBenefits are pretty solid, nothing to complain about here.\r\n\r\nSales training is top-notch. However, only recently did the company start caring about giving its salespeople a strong technical foundation.\r\n\r\nOverall, a lot of Oracle's pros can be found at any other large tech company.", "cons": "Oracle is a behemoth of a company. You're just a number and any recognition you'll receive for doing a good job will be shortly met with a \"what have you done for me lately?\" mentality from your boss/director. \r\n\r\nDecision-making is a privilege reserved solely for upper management who rarely if ever step foot on the sales floor. For example, FY20 brought sweeping changes to OD Sales, with tons of people demoted without notice. I had 6 different managers my final year at the company. Sales here is a total revolving door.\r\n\r\nPromotions are much harder to come by now as Covid led to several hiring freezes. The company would rather hire more Class Ofs for less money than promote internally or hire from the outside. Speaking of which, every account has upwards of 50 sales reps all calling into the same DBA, IT Manager, etc. so that by the time you reach out, you'll most likely be hung up on or sent straight to voicemail.\r\n\r\nWith promotions come minuscule 5% salary increases and unreasonable sales targets and commission rates.\r\n\r\nBDCs, Inside Sales, and Field Sales, are often pitted against each other due to asinine territory management plans. Instead of working together to sell across product verticals, sales reps have to horde opporunity intelligence to ensure they can hit their quotas.\r\n\r\nWhile Oracle does well in HW, On premise DB, and some SaaS, its PaaS & IaaS offerings are sorely lacking and the pressure to compete with the likes of AWS and Azure falls, unfortunately, on the sales reps.\r\n\r\nWhile Oracle may be a well-known name to add to a resume, I'd highly suggest looking elsewhere.

Such an incredible place to learn - NetSuite puts a ton of pressure on their entry level analysts to learn and learn fast, I think that if you want a challenge this job will give it to you. You'll be really stressed your first year trying to learn everything and to be a good consultant but the amount you learn in your first year is insurmountable compared to other jobs\r\n\r\n2. Very little micro-managing - if you like to take on leadership and do your things yourself NetSuite doesn't micro manage - in fact your manager will probably never even know a fraction of the things you're doing most of the day. Definitely a pro if you don't like to be micro-managed a con if you want to have a relationship with your manager\r\n\r\n3. Heavy exposure to many lines of business - depending on what you specialize in, NetSuite provides you great exposure to many different types and kinds of businesses through their \"shared resource pool\"", "cons": "1. Isolating - very little connection between managers/co-workers/project managers. You feel really distant from management and your \"manager\" doesn't even really know what you're up to unless you're in trouble. Oracle doesn't do anything to help foster a connection between leadership and their employees.\r\n\r\n2. Very little work-life balance - expect to work weekends, late nights, and not get paid overtime until after your first year. Your PTO and vacation days are counted against your utilization so basically they inevitably discourage you from using PTO as your utilization is the key metric they look at for promotions. Expect to give your life and soul to NetSuite for your first 2 years if you end up staying that long\r\n\r\n3. Over-Utilized and Underpaid - compared to other firms oracle overworks their tenured consultants while consistently underpaying them. You won't get a bonus, you won't get a pay raise until they promote you - it's really corporate and you can't do anything about it (no negotiations, \"it's just how it is\")\r\n\r\n4.

In other words, you don't want to work a deal \"too big\" or it will get taken away. This leads to poor communication and confusion of the prospect/customer. \r\n\r\nChurn and burn culture with a warm body in place. Oracle treats sales as a cost, not an investment. No incentive to cross sell or collaborate with your co-workers. This leads to a high loss rate to competitors who sell strategically. It also leads to a dishonest work environment in terms of deal collaboration. Close rate is around 10% mind you. \r\n\r\nOracle rewards Audit Bargain Close and moving a customers spend from one bucket to another and neglects any kind of incentive to find genuine new revenue.\r\n\r\nVast majority of sales managers and even VPs have never sold genuine net new revenue, but got to where they are by the same Audit Bargain Close methodology, reading Oracle contracts to exploit the comp plan, or have managed KPI-based sales \"support orgs\" and somehow moved into managing sales. Thus, they have no real ideas of how to find new revenue. Oracle's revenue hasn't grown in 8 years, so obviously no one is actually selling genuine net new revenue. High customer churn because Oracle would rather pay audit jockeys to screw over customers than hire enough customer success managers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR, is this the kind of company you want to \"sell\" for?\r\n\r\nOracle's revenue hasn't grown in 8 years, yet EPS has.  High churn and low sales payouts (due to most reps not even remotely getting to their targets despite the org number as a whole being 100%+).\r\n\r\nOracle has been sued multiple times for \"Audit Bargain Close\" sales tactics.  This leads to high customer churn because Oracle doesn't understand that modern technology isn't as monolithic or hard to remove as it was in the 90s.  \r\n\r\nThere is an entire industry dedicated to servicing Oracle customers and protecting them from over usage and being audited.\r\n\r\nThis is not a sales company, it is a legal/accounting company.  It's a shame because the technology itself is world class."}, {"review_title": "Good company to work with", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Sales Representative in Bucharest, Bucuresti", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunity, Challenges, Commitment, Good professionals", "cons": "Team work, disjointed groups, lack of cohesion between teams"}, {"review_title": "Good Place", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Senior Applications Developer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work-life balance is good in oracle.", "cons": "Salary, hikes, promotions are slow but eventually, it depends on higher management."}, {"review_title": "Fast Paced Environment", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "12 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Senior Consulting Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Forward thinking company\r\nLots of internal opportunities", "cons": "Sometimes too fast paced and hard to keep your head above water."}, {"review_title": "If you get the right team", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer PMTS in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work wise you get very good exposure", "cons": "Very less salary hikes \r\nSometimes it is not even there"}, {"review_title": "Oracle", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "WFH, Flexibility, Purely depends on which Team/Manager/BU you work with", "cons": "Avoid Sustaining Engineering Division (it's extended support work,) , No Formal process for hikes and promotions.
