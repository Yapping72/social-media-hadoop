However, once I dove into the program, I found it to be very misleading. I was recruited for my district and was later informed that by taking the position I helped meet a quota for the number of MTP's hired in my district. I trained in a very busy store and it seemed like training me was somewhat of a distraction for management. I am a very small framed female and I feel like the amount of physical ability necessary to perform this job was very understated during my initial store visit and interview process. It almost seems like they are willing to hire anyone in order to make their stores more diverse, instead of hiring based on actually ability to perform all aspects of the job. For training, I spent 80% of my time watching videos and only about 20% of my time learning the actually duties of an Assistant Manager. The program then relocates and promotes the MTP to a position as Assistant Manager, which is great in theory, but I felt as though the short training leaves the trainee ill prepared to do the job to the best of his/her ability. My first week at my Assistant Manager position, I was informed that my manager was ill and that I would need to open the store on my own (keep in mind that I had never even stepped foot in this store due to the fact that it was 5 hours away from my original location and I was given 5 days notice before my start date). After finally getting slightly more adjusted to the store I realized that majority of my day was spent doing housekeeping chores and very little time was spent doing managerial duties.

As a sales associate, I was expected to not only sell product, understand what each product should be used on, and stock/face shelves. I was also expected to unload freight, organize the warehouse with the forklift, put freight away, tint paint, give color consultation, do lead generation calls, take deliveries, pick up product from other stores, and anything else that came up in the day. If a manager wasn't in the store it landed on me (or whoever was the most experienced in the store) to handle the situation.\r\n\r\nMy biggest complaint was with corporate and a lot of what happened while I was there didn't directly impact me, but I saw what it did to the management and other employees within the store. Store managers are paid salary, but they're expected to work as much as they possibly can. This led to them working 12-13 hour days at least 5 days a week, but sometimes they would also come in on the weekends. They are overworked and underpaid. If you do the math, they're really making under minimum wage with how many hours they work and with the fact that they don't get overtime.\r\n\r\nAssistant managers do get paid overtime, but not every assistant wants to do that. My former assistant was one of those who didn't want to work overtime as it isn't a requirement, by law, and he had a life. When corporate asked why he can't work overtime and my store manager explained that he's working as much he wants to, corporate's response was 'Well, what's he working for our company for if he isn't willing to work as much as he can for us?' This response to me was unacceptable and one of the reasons that I left Sherwin Williams after 3 years.\r\n\r\nPart of what led to this was that they watch how much their part-timers are working. If you average over 28 hours a week, they will cut your hours to average you out so they don't have to give you benefits. I was fortunate in that my hours never got cut in the 3 years that I was with Sherwin, but I saw this happen multiple times to many different coworkers of mine. In the last month that I was with Sherwin, one of my coworkers got cut to 3 hours a week. How can you live off of that? He ended up taking unemployment (which Sherwin got mad about because that hurts them financially in some way) and my store manager gave him at least $500 out of her own pocket so that he wouldn't quit.\r\n\r\nWe were understaffed in my last month with Sherwin. One coworker was cut to 3 hours a week, two others worked full time jobs and only worked about 1-2 days a week and along the way my assistant left the company. That left me, my store manager and two other coworkers. The other two coworkers had to watch their hours so they didn't get cut. I knew I would be leaving throughout this so I didn't worry about it.\r\n\r\nMy store manager also was having medical issues where she was having cataplexy (a form of seizures) in front of customers. She talked to her doctor and he was going to put her on medical leave. The doctor forgot to put an effective date on the note, he just dated the note as the day he wrote it. I assume that that meant that she was to go on leave immediately. Sherwin took advantage of that and asked my manager to stay with the company for 2 weeks so they could figure out what they were going to do staffing wise given that she was going on leave, my assistant two weeks later would be leaving and I would also be leaving. My store manager's last day and my last day were the same day. Sherwin still had not figured out who was going to come into the store to work.\r\n\r\nThis company is unorganized. I could go on, as I didn't even mention that their freight trucks are never on time, we always run out of product, I had a manager from another store that I worked at yell at me because he was being overworked and I couldn't come into a shift that he had scheduled me, they don't require their employees to take lunch breaks (somehow) and it's just a 'go when you want' kind of thing and you better hope that you have time to eat, they don't require employees to get licensed to use their forklifts (somehow), and they don't give you proper training in color consultation, some products such as the industrial and marine line, and there are other areas where I feel safety is overlooked. There was a time where I cut my hand really bad at work and I was urged by a manager to not go to the ER to get stitches (I ended up going anyway and, guess what, I needed stitches on it).\r\n\r\nI do not recommend Sherwin Williams. There are PLENTY of other companies out there that you can work for. They try to make the job and company sound amazing. DO NOT DRINK THE KOOL-AID! I've seen many people who work for this company get sucked in. These are people that have worked for the company for 20-30 years and the company doesn't care about them. Some are quitting after all this time. Some are literally demoting themselves so they get paid hourly and aren't required to be at the store 12-13 hours a day.\r\n\r\nSorry for the novel, but this is important and you MUST know what you are getting yourself into with Sherwin Williams."}, {"review_title": "Internship was lacking", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "29 Oct 2008", "job_title": " Management Training Intern", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Corporate training does allow for some professional development, most people working for the company are friendly and enthusiastic about what they do, your hard work pays off", "cons": "I was in the Management Training Internship and it left a lot to be desired.

The company also utilizes knowledge hotlines that employ experienced live people on the other end that ensure you'll always be able to find the right answer to a customer issue.\r\n\r\nThough I yet don't know of all the career opportunities at Sherwin I have learned about some of my managers' career paths with the company, and it appears that there is quite a bit of room for movement and advancement if you apply yourself. Many of the upper-level managers I've talked to have been interns, management trainees, assistant and store managers, sales reps, sales managers, and more. It is very common to be working with people (especially management) that have been with company 10+ years, which to me is a pretty strong testament to how the company treats dedicated employees. I have met managers that have been happily employed with the company for over 30 years, including my own grandfather who was a Sherwin store manager for over 30 years before he passed away. \r\n\r\nAs a sales associate I am paid a decent hourly rate and get enough hours, but have been offered a fair and much better, salaried pay out-of- school as a management trainee that is paired with supposed strong options for a benefits package that include retirement options such as 401k and a company-paid pension, different employee stock options, and your usual medical/dental etc. I work with a manager that explained how he initially wanted his job at SW primarily for the strong benefits. The pay and benefits supposedly get much better as you lengthen your stay with the company and move up towards store and district management. I have been told by managers that raises and career advancement in the company are very performance-based and driven. \r\n\r\nOverall, I am very happy with my current employment at SW and really look forward to developing my skills further with the upcoming training and hope to be an assistant manager within the year and see where it goes from there. I have already made many friends in the company and don't mind waking up for work. I strongly suggest to anyone (especially college students) even considering getting involved with the company to try and get an internship with SW and have fun with it and ask lots of questions, but also take it seriously-  it was an excellent learning/growing experience and is highly recommended for anyone thinking about aiming for a management position at some point in the company as it gets you prepared for work and training in a Sherwin store, cuts the training time for the MTP, and makes you much more attractive in the interview process for the MTP. So far, SW has been a great company to work for.", "cons": "-Promotions and hiring for management positions is done overwhelmingly from the inside of SW, which to some that are not employees of SW and trying to get involved in management with the company may be discouraging. The MTP program has gotten more competitive in the past few years and I believe to even apply for MTP nowadays a 4-year bachelor's degree preferably with a business background is required so that's another factor. If you don't have a college degree you can absolutely get involved with SW and be a driver or a sales associate and maybe some other positions I'm unaware of but I'd imagine it would be much more difficult to work your way up in the company without former formal education.   \r\n\r\n-Sometimes proper staffing can be an issue in smaller-volume stores during big sales."}, {"review_title": "Great company with great products.

Half of this was true. The stores where never staffed again. Upper management must have thought we did such a good job being understaffed there was little reason to bring on more men. Now many employees are beginning to leave and the ones still around are worn out bad. \r\n\r\nThe company also use to employ from within. They valued experience over everything else. Now they almost only hire people right out of college.  These college kids do not know anything for the first year. This angers the old time employees looked over. They are told they do not get the promotion, but then asked to train their new boss. The college kids only end up angering customers who see the injustice. Then after a year or two, with a college degree and some work experience they leave the company. \r\n\r\nI was originally an employee for a company that Sherwin-Williams acquired.  I watched over 7 years as they cut full time employees, looked over loyal employees, and mocked good men who worked for other companies. Upper management has a real pride issue they need to deal with. They feel they are invincible and no one can take them out. They treat employees like office supplies, to be used and then replaced.

That statement could not be further from the truth.  SW  has many rules and regulations passed down from the corporate headquarters.  Basic pay, store hours, inventory, selling events, pricing, margins, and several others business aspects are all pretty much controlled by SW corporate or district.  The main thing that bugs me is SW charges the stores 1% all the inventory they have at the end of each month.  This expense affects how your yearly numbers turn out.  Also, there is a major push by the District to keep inventory low.  However, frequently the stores are forced to take overstock items from the main distribution center.

At many locations, the duties of a part-timer blur very much with those of the store managers. In this way, it's good to earn such solid sales/networking/management experience, yet it's frustrating if it doesn't lead to promotion. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, promotions from part-time positions to Management trainee positions are an enigma; some kids get put straight into the program (earning $18+ an hour) while some really awesome and knowledgeable employees have to work for 2-3 years before being offered the management trainee position (if at all). In this way, most employees agree that nepotism and kissing-up to the district manager is the only quick way to get promoted, rather than exemplary performance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, working at Sherwin is only worth it once/if you become a management trainee or higher (thus earning $18+ per hour).

But even when you do have reliable people, most of the time they are part-timers and are allowed so many hours. When sales are slow, hours can be cut to as drastically as 5 a week. This sucks for the part-timer as well as the salaried manager, who puts in way may more hours than the 96 \"required\" in the job description and is not compensated for it. The store manager is often overwhelmed. \r\n\r\n-Cutthroat atmosphere if your district is toxic. \r\n\r\n-Corporate atmosphere amongst management and leadership. (Yes, this was also a pro but some people don't like that so here you are.) \r\n\r\n-If your sales are low for whatever reason, you are the problem regardless and you are to fix it ASAP.
