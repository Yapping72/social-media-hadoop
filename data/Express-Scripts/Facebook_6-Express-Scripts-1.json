This essentially is telling them to put the patient's needs above their own and their family's need.\r\n- They turn employees against each other (inadvertently) by having them report what was not done in their section by the other shift. Then that shift is told what mistakes they made. Since you know exactly who is working in your section/area on the other shift, this makes for some incredibly awkward situations between employees and months/years of this can cause some real friction.\r\n- Some members of management seem to hold grudges towards cetain employees and managers. This tension also creates awkward situations.\r\n- Employees/managers tend to lash out at one another when overworked (though some of this is voluntary overtime that the employee decided to work, as opposed to the company forcing them to). Some employees will work an extra 2-4 hours a day and, as a result, become irritable and leave other employees stressed out, and in turn angry, from dealing with tired coworkers."}, {"review_title": "A place you can't  wait to leave!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "18 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working at Medco was a pleasure.

On one hand, management asks us to do what is best for our Members.  On the other hand, they ask us to do what is best for our Clients.  Then there's the need to generate revenue for the company.\r\n\r\nIf you know anything about insurance industry, this is fundamentally conflicting mandates that cannot be reconciled.  Between Clients, Members, and Express Scripts, only 2 out of 3 parties can be happy at any given point.\r\n\r\nDespite the management mantra, our current business model disincentivizes us from doing what is best for our members and clients because disproportionate amount of the company profit is tied to script volume.  The more sick our members are, higher the script volume, and more money Express Scripts make. We are a one-trick pony.\r\n\r\nWall Street-consumption-ready sound bite about our diversified revenue streams is largely a farce. It doesn't matter if the revenue sources are evenly split between specialty drugs, mail order, service fees, and rebates if the size of the overall pie is completely dependent on the script volume.  This is not true diversification.\r\n\r\nFor true diversification and script-agnostic growth strategy, the company needs think outside the box it is trapped in, and invest in innovative strategies and people.  On the surface the company has been trying to be position itself as all-in-one, benefits management company, pharmacy, healthcare provider, and research institution.  But it is failing in all of them.\r\n\r\nTake the Big Data opportunity as an example.  As a PBM, we are sitting on mountains of empirical data about members, providers, treatment, and outcome.  We are not using them to drive growth in meaningful ways, because we are willfully ignoring data points that can improve member outcome and lower costs, but that can potentially reduce script volume.\r\n\r\nInstead, the big data is being used mostly for client marketing purpose (a.k.a Express Scripts Lab) and cut operating expenses, rather than meaningfully growing top-line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPay problem.\r\n\r\nThe current HR compensation structure and performance management system are designed to attract and retain mediocrity.  Many good people have already left and we are left with smart, but sour staff who've been chronically underpaid, and now even more sour than ever.\r\n\r\nPaying market rate salary is not going to work with Express Scripts.  In order to attract and retain good talent, the company needs to be paying above market rate.  When you have a problem that can easily be solved by literally throwing more money at it, you say \"thank you\" and start throwing cash.\r\n\r\nAfter the merger, management significantly reduced options and RSUs for middle managers and top talents to the point of insult.  Long term incentive is a key strategy in retaining top talents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT-pocalypse\r\n\r\nThe company suffers from weak IT leadership, particularly at Sr. Director level and above.  We are in a sore need to recruit highly competent, bold, leaders from a proven technology company to clean up the disastrous IT foundations that are root of cause of many project failures and hindrance to new initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe current leadership positions are all occupied by 50 something year old males or (30-40 year old females) with dubious technical skills who think going 'agile' is as easy as saying abracadabra and its utterance alone provides magical 30% productivity boost.\r\n\r\nNews Flash: Express Scripts is not set up for agile, and to its fairness, most large companies are not either.\r\n\r\nWhat the company needs is a new IT visionary and his/her lieutenants that will stand up to the senior management and call spade a spade, but smart enough to recognize when the lower level staff is serving turd sandwiches with PB&J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganizational culture and structure problem.\r\n\r\nThere is culture of business-worship that results in gross mis-allocation of resources. There are literally hundreds of directors on the business side with no direct reports while other department directors have to manage staff of half a dozen to hundreds.  And the ugly truth is, we have some of the weakest and woefully under-qualified business and product owners I have seen in my career.\r\n\r\nAnd in order to 'serve' business needs better, management inserted liaison roles between business and IT called them \"BAT\" or \"BIAC\"; roles that were traditionally performed by business analysts and project managers.  In theory, this specialization of roles sounds like a good idea from resource management perspective.  In practice, it results in IT project managers who are effectively clueless about the details of the projects they are managing, business analysts whose roles have been marginalized, and across the board staff bloat."}, {"review_title": "Major overhaul needed for morale issues.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Indianapolis, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Large corporation with decent benefits and opportunities for furthering one's education", "cons": "At the location in Indianapolis near the airport, a manager for the eligibility group would regularly pass employees without acknowledging them.

Well here is how it is in the trenches.  This is the worst company I have ever worked for in my whole career.  After the merger, ESRX introduced us to their form of management.  It is modeled after the car company Toyota and called Kaizen.  This company thinks production is production whether you are resolving a DUR issue with maybe 15 different interactions and several different doctors, or screwing in lug nuts.  Every job has a SWI (SOP) about how to do each part of it and it is broken down to seconds.  You have so many seconds to do each task whether it be a simple edit to resolve or one with multiple issues that requires research.  Every time there is a new or updated SWI, it is sent to you via email, but you are not allowed to read it while you are in production.  Each job classification has a \"Kaizen board\" in their section with your employee number and the previous days' production.   You are either red, yellow or green  (threshold, target, stretch).  There are even red, yellow and green stoplights in each department-just like on the assembly line!  There are other items on the board about how to improve things, which boils down to how can we make you work faster.  The company is constantly raising the goal.  If you do not reach the goal, you are put in the disciplinary process!  They use some other euphemism, but it is disciplinary.  Every 2 weeks, you meet with your supervisor, and if you haven't improved your rate, you proceed to the next step of discipline up to and including dismissal.  Under- goal rates are considered bad behavior.  So to be a good employee, you have to work faster than what your normal comfort zone is.  This causes people to ignore things they would otherwise question which greatly increases your possibility of making a life threatening error.  This is no longer a Pharmacy-it has been transformed into a factory.  That is why this job is so stressful.

I think that, in general, if you keep your head down and do just what you're told without asking too many questions, you'll probably be OK.  Some people are fine with being a 'cog in the wheel'; if that's what you're looking for, this might be a place to consider.  ESI still has a reputation in the general community as a good place to work, so it could be advantageous to have it on your resume if you're building a career in pharma and related businesses.\r\n\r\nThe lunch facilities are very good and reasonably priced; about half the people bring their lunch, and half take advantage of the Aramark-operated fresh lunch option.  There is a variety of freshly-prepared options, including numerous healthy choices.  There is also a coffee/ smoothie bar with snacks open for a few hours when the lunch room is not.  Parking is adequate, and more covered parking is being added.\r\n\r\nESI has some relationship with University of Missouri, St. Louis (on whose campus the HQ resides), and there may be opportunity for educational benefits as a result.\r\n\r\nBenefits are basic; some companies have better, but some certainly have worse.\r\n\r\nPeople mostly keep to themselves.", "cons": "If you are top-tier talent, this will not be a good place to grow your career.  ESI will teach bad habits, and will not support good ones.  You will not be able to influence change for the better.  You will receive no training, no education about the industry, and none about the overall function of the company and its goals.  You will be asked to put on blinders, to do a narrowly defined tightly prescribed task, and not ask questions, not try to learn.  Express Scripts is not a company guided by principles and vision.  People speak with cynical pride about some of the things they've done to save money that are ultimately at the expense of patients.\r\n\r\nWhen I knew that ESI would not be a long-term situation for me, I asked a few select people about some of my observations of being a terribly silo-ed workplace with no communication and no leadership; they laughed and said, \"Yeah, that's the way it is here.  It's been that way for as long as I can remember [around 20 years].\"\r\n\r\nESI pays below industry standard, and does not retain top talent.  People who have been with the company for a long time are those who have learned to keep their heads down and mouths shut.  They typically have little other work experience to compare to the ESI culture.\r\n\r\nI experienced a reasonable amount of autonomy in my job, but I think in retrospect that that was because there was such poor management.  No one ever seems happy to be there; no one makes eye contact; no one says 'Good morning\" or in any way expresses any pleasure at working at this company.  There is a daily pervasive sense of frustration or dread, and a culture of 'staying below the radar screen'.\r\n\r\nThere is little if any coordination between departments or work teams.  Theoretically, everyone should be working toward the same company goal, but the lack of communication and the presence of territoriality -hostility and protectionism- leads to duplication and wasted time and resources, and to an environment of low morale and job dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nWork areas are labeled with signs hanging from the ceiling, but work teams are very frequently spread out randomly across the facility, rather than with desks and workspaces in close proximity which would allow and encourage collaboration.  Space is at a premium, but no one seems concerned about organizing it.\r\n\r\nNepostism and cronyism is the standard for making hiring and promotion decisions.  ESI, just like every other company these days, claims to be a \"high performance company\" or \"driven by performance\".  The nearly complete absence of training, the amateurish new employee orientation, and the systemic inefficiencies refute this claim for Express Scripts.  Promotions have little if anything to do with qualifications; they have more to do with cronyism.  Very often, management hired from outside the company are castoffs, hired on the cheap, not for proven ability or performance.  There are also numerous examples of hiring people for high-level positions of responsibility  -with other people's livelihoods in their hands-  who have no experience and minimal ability to learn or learn quickly.  So, then everyone else is more pressured to 'perform', but dragged down because it was more important to hire the incompetent relative of some other manager or executive.\r\n\r\nSenior level executives seem unaware of this and other practices, or unmotivated to recognize the problems caused to overall performance of the company.  If shareholders knew, one wonders how they'd respond to such waste and inefficiency.  It is essentially stealing, to hire incompetent people for unethical reasons, and bring down performance as a result, while expending resources (including salaries and benefits) on people who should not be in their positions.\r\n\r\nPeople seem to be with ESI either for a long time or a very short time.  Those who've been there for a long time have very little if any experience elsewhere, so they have little to compare their ESI work experience to; they don't know how bad ESI is as a company and as an employer.  Those who are there for a short time usually leave because they know better, or because their resistance to the standard operating procedures can't be accomodated by supervisors who are consistently in over their heads when it comes to their responsibilities to provide leadership; these 'leaders' are threatened by subordinate competence and persistantely afraid for their jobs, and overwhelmed with workload.  There is no work/life balance, the higher up the chain you go.  'Leaders' do not know how to delegate, much less lead people.\r\n\r\nAlso, the facilities  -the shiny new St. Louis HQ- should be an embarrassment to a company that wishes to compete on this level of revenue and market competition.  Everything from lighting, floor coverings, heating and air conditioning, computers and IT, is just basic, used and well-worn.  This might be acceptable for a non-profit with a small budget, but for a company which needs to foster innovation and develop competitive strategies and actions, it merely adds another disspiriting layer to the management style of incompetence, oppression and back-biting."}, {"review_title": "Good Coworkers, Low Job Security", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Feb 2010", "job_title": "Senior Java Programmer in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My coworkers were generally good to be around and I got to work on some large and complicated Java software", "cons": "Sudden and massive layoffs and project cancellations, last minute changes that invalidate large chunks of work, poor communication between employees and managers"}, {"review_title": "Unfair", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "14 Mar 2012", "job_title": " in Tempe, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "being a mail order pharmacy, there is really no brain work to this job. the equipment counts your medication for you. if non challenging is what you prefer in a job, then this one is for you", "cons": "i was let go for a situation that had happened with no prior write up for that particular event. and although i immediately fixed the situation, i was terminated. if your head isnt up your superiors ass, you will not achieve advancement."}, {"review_title": "Verifying 1200 prescriptions a day.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "22 Jul 2013", "job_title": "Pharmacist in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pharmacists can work from home, wearing  jeans and shorts in the office, stock has been going up.", "cons": "The pressure to meet the numbers has taken a new ugly leap for work at home pharmacists.

The company as a whole isn't awful but its not great. In the four years I've worked at ESI (first Accredo then Medco, now ESI) I have had 4 different supervisors because they are always changing what the think isn't working. Always moving people or coming up with new ways to \"help\" you collect on claims. Every company has policies in place, steps they have to follow but at ESI we are supposed to demand the insurance companies to do what we say and if we can't, we have to get our supervisor to do it for us. Its all about meeting that cash goal, that as said in other comments, is always higher and is never attainable. If we don't meet the cash goal set by upper management then we are in this hand holding match where they ask over and over \"what can we do to help\" but if you say anything you are passive aggressively attacked. Or condescendingly told how you are wrong. I have never felt so incompetent in any position ever. Even if you do well its \"that's great but why aren't you doing it all the time\". Its never enough and there's too many cooks in the kitchen trying to help or fix the issues. \n\nOutside of that the business process we have to follow change so often always trying to make it better or easier but really don't change it if it works. We just learn it and get used to it then it changes. Then we get reprimanded for not following the new process or policies. And you better believe that's going on your annual review. I like this motto: keep it simple stupid. This company needs to follow this more. It makes our job harder and more time consuming to have to continuously look for the newest way to do what we need to do to get a simple task done. Changing something in the system that's wrong could take months! \nI work on a specific group of insurance carriers and those patients under that insurance for any/all drugs that are sent out. Would you believe we, as in the collections department just found out we don't have contracts with not one but two insurance companies and we NEVER did! and we have been servicing patients for YEARS under these carriers. Are you kidding me?!? Now I have to tell patients they have to get theirs scripts somewhere else because we don't have a contract with those carriers so they aren't obligated to pay us. Uhm... And I'm the incompetent one? how did we not know this sooner. It happens all the time with errors that go on for years that one day someone says holy crap how are you still in business with stuff like this. I wouldn't get my scripts there but I have to or I have to pay full price elsewhere. Don't work here and don't use their service it's awful. I spend most of my days fixing mistakes we as a company made and trying to get money for it.

Example: Express Scripts will not cover Omeprazole, even with prior authorization, even when presented with documentation from a Dr's office that it has already proven to be the most effective therapy for a patient, simply because they find the medication cost prohibitive. With prior authorization, they will cover a less-expensive medication, that does placate some of the symptoms associated with these particular medical condition(s) but, is only partially-effective therapy.        Metrics are everything in the ESI culture, spending abnormal amounts of time extrapolating possible cost-effective measures. The emphasis on charts and percentages over customer care is disturbing.   Bottom line is they don't value their employees: my last review ( a very positive one I might add) I was informed that I would not receive a raise, as I was already paid , \"35% above my market value.\" Exact words.

The workforce  is graded on a mandatory curve (20% threshold/70% target/10% stretch) and threshold performers are typically managed out (not up). Calibration of employees performance is a pissing contest between middle level managers.  The more aggressive and persuasive you are (as a manager) the less chance your team members end up as threshold performers.  I say \"chance\" because upper management has the final word and employees who are \"highly visible\" and contribute nothing ( can you say brown-noser?) are often rated higher than employees who actually do the work needed. In the end it's a popularity contest\r\nDon't mis-understand me ... there are people who work their butts off and get recognized; but, for every one of those, there are 3 that work just as hard and get no recognition and 2 who do nothing but be \"visible\" and are designated as stretch performers.  In at least one case that I know of a manager was evaluated as a stretch performer despite having no stretch performers on her team ... how is that possible ? \r\n\r\nManagement in IT has recently (in the last 2 years) moved toward an outsourced model and (in some IT departments)  instead of acting like mature ethical people and announcing layoffs and providing severance packages, they have perverted the evaluation process to convince people they should leave (adjusting evaluations downward, changing the metrics by which performance was to be evaluated a month before review time, putting strong performers on performance improvement plans etc. ).  In other IT departments layoffs were announced severances and bonuses were paid.\r\nThe treatment of employees is clearly inequitable.", "cons": "Work/life balance is non-existent ... management preaches it loud enough and tells you how the new model will make it happen, but the reality is, if you don't work more than a 40 hour week consistently there is no way to get all the work done that is expected.  There are exceptions ... there are people who have so little direction from their management that they struggle to find enough to fill their time (these are often people who've carried the workload of two or more people in years past and thus apparently proved to management that they can't be scared off by overwork!!)\r\n. \r\nManagement has been saying \"do more with less\" for so long and IT has been pulling it off for so long, that now they are convinced we can do anything with nothing.  There are even departments where management has instituted mandatory 45 hour work weeks (an increase from the 40 hr work week most people signed up for) with no pay increase.  It's legal because everyone affected is salaried (exempt from the protections of labor law).  But by no stretch of the imagination could it be called ethical.  In case you don't want to do the math that's effectively a 12% per hour pay-cut!!  \r\nAs a measure of just how unreasonable the expectations are - 2 contractors at ESI (who are paid by the hour for every hour they work!!)  have told their contracting companies that they want to be placed somewhere else or they will quit because the expectations are unreasonable!\r\n\r\nRecognition programs are being eliminated and what remains is a joke.  A telling point is that the only \"Employee of the Quarter\" who was not a manager in the last five years was a janitor who literally saved someones life on the premises!  Every Employee of the Year as far back as i can remember has been a manager ... why are managers even eligible ? \r\nOther \"perks\" that have been eliminated or severely curtailed, casual Friday, a small gift on a milestone anniversary (replaced by an email from the CEO's secretary), flexible work hours & working remotely.\r\n \r\nProject management is a black hole of dissatisfaction and despair - project managers are given 8 to 10 projects to manage, held accountable for the on time/on budget delivery and have no authority to assign (or even keep assigned) resources. Responsibility without authority is a recipe for failure.\r\n(There are even a few positions which have the opposite situation - authority without accountability.  not a problem for the lucky few in this situation, but boy, does it cause a ton of pain for the people trying to fulfill the whims of these folks!  A recipe for disaster if ever there was one.) \r\n\r\nTechnical leads have to fill the roles of project managers more often than not (see previous point) in addition to being the technical leads for offshore resources who have no understanding of the complex systems they are changing and minimal skills in the languages they are working in.\r\n\r\nI recently heard that as many as 25 of the account management team had taken time off for mental health reasons and at least 3 people that i know personally have had stress related health issues some are even taking anti-depressants to enable them to continue to work there. \r\n\r\nA manager of my acquaintance described the management philosophy at ESI as \"Kiss up & Kick down.\"  and told me that managing up was more important than managing people.  That's a sad commentary on the entire management organization. ESI doesn't have leaders and managers, they have bosses.  \r\n\r\nThe work environment is positively toxic. Morale is at an all time low and it's getting worse.

The company feels that they are and should be the #1 priority in your life. You get time off weekly based off of the hours you have worked, good luck using that time off though. When you request the time off, it is approved based off work volume and how many other people in a large department or combination of multiple departments, have already been approved for that day off.

If you have an issue with attendance issues because of medical issues, then ask your supervisor to decrease your hours in an effort to minimize your attendance issues, you are told based on work volume, they cannot approve a decrease in work hours.

Even when managers themselves would call a unit meeting,  a lot of questions by staff we're always skirted around so no real answers were received and you would leave the meeting scratching your head asking yourself, what just happened.  There was a very vocalized \"open door policy\" but hardly anyone used it in fear of then being picked on in your weekly monitors, which would add such a greater level of stress to an already high job stress level that people would even sometimes quite.  I saw this happen to many very good people who the company should have sought to keep as they were actually doing the correct job and asking relevant questions.

We who worked there knew why it came back so hi a \"good\" rating, one word, \"Scared\" . Most people who took it, even though it was done by independent contractor, felt the company could figure out who was filling it out and then that person too would be picked on.

The company is very unique in what they offer and how the internal systems work, yet ESI believes that anyone from outside the company can step right in and pick up where someone left off. They do not value a person's longevity, experience or knowledge of internal systems. If you are a consultant, you're hired. If a permanent employee, the job prospects are not promising. \r\n\r\nManagers fail to understand all the tasks and roles that their people perform as part of their daily roles. If you fill a void that is needed yet it's technically not in your job description, then no one knows about it. And because managers have no idea what you do, they assign too much work to complete in an unrealistic time frame. If someone does leave the company, there are no exit plans to transition the remaining work to someone else. It becomes an afterthought of what happens to the work in progress. It's then handed to someone else that is already overburdened, to figure out a new system or project. Even when several weeks notice are given of someone leaving, it takes months to find a replacement, if a replacement is even hired.\r\n \r\nNone of the job descriptions make sense. They do not define a person's role, and if you need to find someone from another department, good luck trying to track down the name of the department to find someone. You need to reply on internal connections and asking around. \r\n\r\nThere is no promotion from within or from areas outside of St. Louis. Even though ESI merged with a company (Medco) that had locations throughout the USA and had talent from across the country, unless you are located in St. Louis, then the chances of being promoted or being hired are slim to none. \r\n\r\nThere is poor planning with new projects. The correct department expert are never brought into initial discussions for scope and sizing. By the time the expert are brought in, the sizing has already been determined so the project scope is greatly reduced or the project is eliminated. And since new projects always bring in new people from the outside to work on the project, it always takes two to three times longer to implement the project due to the lack of knowledge and misses.

The image of a company that has employees with the ability to have dedicated focus on their clients.\r\nI have been asked by upper management and sales to tell clients I have 7 clients on my desk (or at the very least under 10) instead of 27 because they know clients don't want to think they are an after thought to their account manager.

They could be sitting in limbo for weeks on end.  It's not the agent's fault as they are specifically told to just complete the form and do nothing further.  If you do, you're in trouble.  If you make any effort to actually help a patient and go outside your job description,  you receive a warning.  Anything you do to help a customer, needs to be done under the radar.

Run as fast as you can ...and don't look back!  Of course when they recruit they say and show all the right things.  I would say there may be positions out there that are worse, but besides Wal-mart, I have not seen any.\r\n\r\nAll pharmacists in a production role, which is most except the few supervisors, punch a clock and have an attendance point system so that if one is more than 5 minutes late to their shift...tisk tisk....you get a attendance point.  Imagine junior high school and you have the idea.   Maybe that was great for 7th graders but when you are a well educated professional it is quite debilitating to not only morale but also professional flexibility.  Such flexibility would lend to cooperation amongst peers to switch shifts, cover lunches, work extra nights during maternity leaves or any number of things where a professional environment generally benefits from some healthy cooperation.\r\n\r\nAll staff pharmacists are required to utilize a tracking system for each activity.  Take a call,  verify an order, your computer goes down and need to reboot for 3-5 minutes...all have to be clock coded in the phone system that is used to track everything.  Need to go to the bathroom for 5 minutes?  Well you must punch in the correct clock code at your station before leaving and upon returning.  Counseling a patient who has terminal cancer?  Well the call can't last longer than 7:30 seconds or you are outside of goal. These metrics are tracked and reviewed with each pharmacist monthly based on their monthly average performance.  There is no discussion of the quality of care, or the angry vehement customer who threatened you with a lawsuit. \r\n\r\nThe sad thing is the company has signs up with reminders about the company values called \"The Express Way.\"  Amongst these are such things as Integrity, Collaboration, Alignment, Mutual Respect.  Yet, the daily reality could not be more evasive and uncooperative.  Imagine the juxtaposition illustrated in the recent movie called \"The Hunger Games\" between the government video played during the introduction touting how great the society was but in reality the people in the districts were kept under the control of a suppressive police state and you will have the idea.\r\n\r\nIf that sounds melodramatic, lets review a few specific examples.  Company policy states that if an employee calls in sick the day after a paid holiday then they forfeit holiday pay.  This creates a police state that pre-supposes a criminal mentality onto employees.  The assumption here is that if someone has a sick day immediately following a holiday they are automatically trying to unjustly work the system by playing hooky.  The feedback from management is that they would consider waving the policy on a case-by-case basis if someone provides a doctors note.  Most people in their mid 20's to mid 50's who are relatively healthy, they don't go to the doctor when they need a sick day because, as a generally healthy person, when they are under the weather, they simply get some rest, and take some Tylenol and Vitamin C.  By the time the next day rolls around they generally feel well enough to return to work rather that flying off in a panic to the nearest emergency room or doctors office and paying a $50 co-pay just to prove you weren't lying to the company.\r\n\r\nConcerning annual reviews and raises there is a performance rating where that is based on a curve called a 20/70/10 split.  That is to say that no matter how great anyone might happen to be performing in relation to the goals set forth, 20% of people get a commendable review while 70% are limited to only a acceptable and 10 % get a review suggesting that improvement is needed.  Sounds like a disconnect to me.\r\n\r\nVacation time is limited to only 10 hours per day among the entire staff pool.  Roughly 15 staff pharmacists work in a variety of tasks in the Indianapolis facility.  Getting any reasonable time off while working for this outfit is a long shot at the least.\r\n\r\nThere is a formal company policy that states, \"It is forbidden for any employee to contact the State Board of Pharmacy or any other regulatory agency without specific authorization from management.\"  Now as a pharmacist I know I have an obligation to protect public health and am responsible to the state BOP where I am licensed.  I am not sure,  but I think such a policy might just be illegal.  That is why we have \"whistle blower\" laws in this country.\r\n\r\nIf this review were not limited in length, then this list could go on much longer.\r\n\r\nAs our Pharmacist In Charge (PIC) recently said repeatedly and openly in a group meeting with many staff present while speaking on the topic of Curascript adopting the Accredo name....\"We don't care what people call our company, we just want to get paid!\"  That pretty much sums up the culture here."}, {"review_title": "The Jury is still out", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "17 Mar 2013", "job_title": "St Manager in Pittsburgh, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "ESI management is very unqualified..MSH management will be called upon to make the big decisions..PTO time is generous.", "cons": "Very long hours.

I worked with Curascript over two years in a management position. Due to the economic downturn I was forced to take a job here.  This review is based on working in the Orlando location.\r\n\r\nThe overall corporate culture is honestly the worst I have worked in. Most employees have no empowerment and no voice in the company. The Orlando location has several recruiters who find people to work for the company.  There is usually one training class a month which should tell you how bad the turnover is. As an employee, I felt that I was just a number and I could be easily be replaced if I did not meet the numbers the company sets for their employees. \r\n\r\nThere are several unfilled positions, which requires more work from current employees. I feel many of the positions were for low-skill employees and the company got just that. At times I felt concerned about patients and their medication. For example, a patient care advocate sending medication but not sending syringes/ supply kit that goes along with it. I believe too much is required of an employee that causes the person on the other-side of the phone rush the customer.\r\n\r\nI think a big thing that this company promotes is it\u2019s growth. I found this posting and felt the need to include it in this post. Most growth is attributed to acquisitions, so the growth you read about is not sustainable. Growth is not due to innovation or forward-looking strategy, unless of course it is related to acquiring another company. I believe this to be dead on.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day Curascript pharmacy is a client and patient relationship business which it ultimately fails at. I hope potential job seekers, patients, and plan sponsors read this post. As a person in management I feel this company will fail if it continues on the course it\u2019s on."}], [{"review_title": "\" DID YOU SAY RAISES \"", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Sept 2010", "job_title": "Warehouse in Stockton, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The day shift gives you 3 days off which is cool, and the PTO time that you can earn is real nice.
