It doesn't matter what your degree is in or how long you've been at the company -- if you get stuff done and do it well you'll be treated well.  And, of course, the coworkers are luminaries, but they tend (in my experience) to be accepting of newcomers without the same background.  I've had no trouble digging my fingers into topics from machine learning to the Java virtual machine, learning all the while.  The company has some communication silos due to its size, but the walls aren't solid -- I routinely hack on other peoples' code, and they hack back.  It's all very open.\r\n\r\nThey really pull out all the stops to make sure engineers can do their job, whether you need a second workstation, a thousand more machines in a datacenter, or scones.  Information flow within the company is still quite free, particularly compared to Microsoft or Apple.\r\n\r\nManagers I've interacted with are sharp and encourage good work-life balance, reminding employees to take time off and guarding against burnout.  My managers have constantly communicated their expectations and our performance, and have actively worked to help me in my career development and promotions -- or, when a project slips off track, to understand why and help.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, I think Google's pay is pretty darn good.  Microsoft recruiters assure me that it's 30% lower, but I've got friends at MS and those numbers just don't add up.  This site should do a good job showing the true situation (and the resulting competition will help us all!).", "cons": "You are expected to deliver.  This doesn't mean 80-hour work weeks (at least in my end of the company), but you are expected to make goals and hold yourself to them -- and ideally deliver something that beats the rest of the industry while you're at it.  Do not come to Google expecting a research environment; there's plenty of research going on, but if it's not in your 20% time you'd better have something to ship.  I list this as a con only because I suspect this bit some of the people who rated Google negatively.\r\n\r\nThe company has grown really fast.  This has caused some strain, both in terms of infrastructure and in communication.  Many of the nooglers are fresh out of college, and the naivety cuts both ways: they're simultaneously over-eager to re-engineer everything in sight, and bitter when perks change or they don't get promoted fast (nevermind that it's still better than the rest of the industry -- they've never been there).  With rapid growth comes a lack of focus, as well, with weird projects with no monetization story.  (Caveat: I'm in Ads, where money matters.)\r\n\r\nI get the impression that we've got our share of bad managers.  My manager (and the two immediately above him) are all great -- technically sharp, caring, and happy to get their hands dirty.  But I've heard horror stories from other teams, and you can read plenty of them on this site, I'm sure -- preference for low employee numbers, suckups and yes-men, etc.  I suspect most of the thoroughly bitter people have gotten a bad manager and not requested a transfer out from under him/her.\r\n\r\nOn that note, Google does a bad job of handling underperformers.  They try hard to help crappy engineers and managers improve, but at some point you've got to cut your losses -- a bad employee, particularly one with a bad attitude, is poison that eats away at morale.  I've seen people go through two or more performance improvement plans before finally getting the much-needed axe.\r\n\r\nGoogle also does a fair-to-middling job of handling *overperformers*.  I've gotten a few spot bonuses for successful projects (which, to be fair, were tens of times larger than the bonuses I got at similarly-sized companies in the past), but the motivating effect of the Founder's Awards are gone.  No matter how many millions of dollars you make the company, if you're not in LSE's pet segments, no Founder's Award for you -- it'll go to some guys in search or something.  Google is done making millionaires -- for those of us who got who got here after the IPO, the only way we'll retire is a 401(k).  Again, having worked in industry outside of Google, this makes me wistful but not angry.  I don't expect other people to make me a millionare.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, your family will ask you questions about everything Google related.  Be prepared to have to explain dozens of times that you don't actually work on Search/Maps/Writely/whatever and can't fix their pet problem. :-)"}, {"review_title": "Satisfaction at Google depends on the department you're in.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Jul 2009", "job_title": "Account Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Google is a great place to start your career.

Maybe it varies somewhat by team, but from my vantage point, engineering seemed very bloated and bureaucratic.  There is an obscenely long and restrictive \"style guide\" of programming rules that must be followed and company-wide banned language features that makes coding much less productive than I'm used to.  Code reviews sometimes become bickerfests and can drag on for weeks or months.  The allocation of engineers to teams is awful - my recruiter basically lied about what I would be working on, when I arrived I was assigned to a team and project that I had no interest in whatsoever, and there was nothing I could do about it except suck it up until I could leave.  My coworkers were extremely risk-averse and were far more concerned about breaking something that already worked than about making progress.  Also the culture is biased towards \"perfect\" engineering solutions, and just hacking to get something done is highly frowned upon.  This isn't always bad, and you can learn good programming practices and discipline, but unfortunately it just isn't always practical in the real world of deadlines and needing to make progress.\r\n\r\nThe worst part of all is that I never felt like my work mattered anyway to the success of the company.

Within this role and organization, you receive a great deal of respect and prestige from your clients, as they look to you for strong business guidance. The pay is very competitive, and if you have a supportive manager, the potential to gain merit raises annually is very high (as are the stock refreshes). The company provides many internal trainings for those interested in personal development, and the opportunity to travel to another office in another city/country is readily available on a quarterly basis. Most importantly, it's some of the best people you will ever work with.

Don't believe everything you read in the press about how fantastic Google work culture is. Although the HR department has made multiple attempts to improve the promotion structure at Google, it can be near impossible to navigate all of the appropriate politics to gain a promotion. Furthermore, a promotion in the sales org at Google does not necessarily mean an increase in responsibility or a title change. Employees usually work in roles 1-2 levels above them in order to first demonstrate that they are worthy of promotion. In this same vein, the opportunities for growth are VERY few within this org, and you often find people moving from industry to industry (within the sales org) to keep their day-to-day interesting. There is a huge bottleneck for middle management to make their way into leadership positions. Most importantly, the leadership within the sales org is severely lacking. Leadership makes decisions well removed from the sales organization itself (and its employees) and often work like politicians to further their own careers, rather than improve the larger organization itself."}], [{"review_title": "Google is a great place for engineers", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "10 Feb 2017", "job_title": "Staff Software Engineer in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very smart people and very high density of smart people.

Seemingly you would think this is a good thing, and while to a degree it is (pretty much everyone I work with is outright brilliant), the repercussions of this are far greater than you would initially assume.  Imagine the most type A, overachieving folks in your old college classes. You know, the ones that will literally go way above and beyond to do a truly exceptional job (chances are if you work at Google you were one of those folks). Now imagine only the top 1% of all of those people are in one place at the same time. Now think about what happens to the culture when you put all of those folks together and keep hiring them as your company scales. Suddenly everyone is taking  on the max possible amount of work and doing the equivalent of 3 people's workload, and then that becomes the norm for everyone. And no one will ever complain about it because at the end of the day everyone wants to be a team player and never say no to a request, regardless of the time commitment. This leads to everyone working long hours, working on vacations, and even while sick. \r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, your manager is probably the same way. Since Google will hire a director from another company and make them a manager at Google (because Google is so big a director's scope of work will be similar to that of a manager at Google), chances are your direct manager has the ambition of a top preforming senior leader. And while they are likely to be very nice (for example my current manager is absolutely amazing) , they will set your workload based on your peer's workload since the average assumption is that if the others on the team can do it, why can't you?\r\n\r\nPut this all together and you quickly have folks burning out left and right, and consequentially a very low average tenure for your team despite people loving their core jobs. It quite sad really because everyone I know in my Org is very happy outside of the amount of burnout they feel.  \r\n\r\nAnother important note is that it takes forever to get promoted at Google because regardless of how good the quality of your work is, you have to compete against colleagues who generally speaking are willing to do whatever it takes, and make any life compromise necessary to get promoted.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think Google is a well intended company, with well intended employees that sadly have fell victim to losing their own culture through scaling and hiring the best."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work for programmers.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Nov 2008", "job_title": "Software Engineer II in Mountain View, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Google offers a very goal-oriented and challenging work environment.

He is the best politician I have ever seen in my life. Ever since he promoted to be a manager, he started to play all the dirty games among us. \r\nHe spent $20 mil per year on some equipments which melt down network connectivity so many times every month. He claimed that the equipments would save Google for 10 millions per year, but in fact, we spent a lot more work hours on trying to solve the problems these junks caused. The main problem is, there is no test base for these junks. Aren't we supposed to test all the equipment before we implement or even purchase them? Not these junks... how does it happen? pick ur guess!\r\nHow about we go the manger above him. Too bad.. the upper manager is his buddy. There is no complain or any bad thing would ever leak out through these 2 layers of managers. They cover everything up very well. In fact, one of the manager's jobs should ensure the fairness. Well... \"fairness\" is NEVER been seen at this team.\r\n\r\n2. politics tricks\r\nMy manager has this policy: all the engineers under level III can not talk to the engineers above level IV. Well.... before I join google, I thought anyone could talk directly to anyone, even to CEO. But my manager fired a person who asked questions to a level IV. \r\nHis recently move was - promoted two of his favorites to be managers and directly reported to him. You know what it means? He just promoted himself since there are two managers reporting to him now. That was the exact trick his upper manager did a couple years ago. Now... there are 3 levels of management under one director. How does this director allow this happen?? well.. that's the politics. So, when the new engineer join the team, how many levels above him?? It's IMPOSSIBLE that you get promoted if there is one new layer added.  Most likely, you got downgraded every year!!\r\n\r\n3. STEALING/CHEATING\r\nI've never seen so many cheating cases ever since I graduated from college, but here, at Google. We have two level IV engineers responsible for designing networks with one stealing ideas/credits from the other one's work!! And this cheating is permitted by the upper manager!! How did it happen? well... the managers playing the games. The two (now three) levels managers ensures that none of outside team could work with the talent engineer alone. When they steals, those seniors all lined up and the upper manager would give pressure down to turn in the design and the credits. Whoever on the same side of this level IV engineer would suffer a hard time and have bad reviews from those managers. So, we watched the stealing and cheating happening every day but no one dare to say anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n<to be continued>"}, {"review_title": "anonymous", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The food - kind of overboard actually.", "cons": "Poor management by team leads and next few layers.

I guess more importantly, who doesn't want to know what the expectations for their work are?? \r\n\r\nThe one saving grace for me was that I found a forum for people working from home where some other folks who were doing temp work for Google could get together and chat a little - without breaking any confidentiality agreements - about what we struggled with, how much we were able to do in a day, and what we thought the expectations for us were, based on all of our experiences. \r\n\r\nThe other major downside was that the temp agency they used, WorkForceLogic, was just TERRIBLE - specifically at handling payroll, which is a terrible thing to be terrible at. There were many times that I didn't get paid, got a bonus deducted from my check instead of added to it, et cetera - and it was always a different mistake from all the ones they had made before, and it always took them a while to figure out what had gone wrong, track down whoever needed to fix it, wait for them to get back from lunch or an appointment or come back to work the next day or.... And they were no better at communication, really; I had hoped that once this assignment was up I would be able to get more assignments through WFL, but no matter how many phone calls I made, nobody could ever figure out who I should be talking to or find anyone who would return calls."}, {"review_title": "Still a great place to work as long as you're dreaming to be suddenly rich", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Aug 2009", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Mountain View, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Smart people\r\n- Great technology\r\n- Engineering driven\r\n- Huge impact on the world\r\n- Profitable and financially stable\r\n- Perks", "cons": "- Base pay average, though bonus is high\r\n- low number shares of stock (plus, stock prices are low compared to peak)\r\n- Getting big and bureaucratic (e.g., launch process long and painful)\r\n- Harder to advance because of stronger peers\r\n- Minimal management attention: non-self-starters can get lost"}, {"review_title": "Great place for new grads to start off; limited for more senior folks", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "+ You'll work with smart, hard-working people who care about products and the world\r\n+ Build a great network of people who will eventually leave to start great companies\r\n+ Work on challenging problems and cool products", "cons": "+ Flat org structure makes it hard to move into team lead roles\r\n+ You have to promote yourself and your work well to get ahead\r\n+ Not as entreprenuerial of a working environment as a few years ago; more process now"}, {"review_title": "When No One \"Owns\" Decisions and Managers Fail to Lead, It's Easy for People to Coast", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 Feb 2010", "job_title": "Non-engineer in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Great food\r\n-Internal transparency when it comes to what projects are being worked on (not transparent on things like promotions)\r\n-Lots of stuff going on\r\n-Always changing\r\n-Fun people\r\n-Great location in NYC\r\n-Speakers and authors visit Google--great perk!\r\n-Concierge team helps arrange discounts, etc.\r\n-In-house massage (I will miss that!)\r\n-Good for the resume\r\n-Great place to meet future start-up partners.

My manager never once created an annual or quarterly strategic business plan. He (actually *I*) filled in the template given by management, but he never created a plan we could work toward. As a result, people did what they wanted, which was not always most profitable (in part because short term incentives don't align with long term profitability). This created a lot of problems. In 2007, the company created a new layer of middle-manager jobs and hired people internally...without training them to be managers! Disaster. Lots of inefficiency and broken promises. Horrible decision that continues to plague employees. There are some good managers, I just didn't work with any. \r\n-No career development. Minimal worthwhile training. You can take a course here and there, but when it comes to moving around the company, watch out. Sales, Engineering, and Enterprise are silos---you can't move between them. *Everyone* complains about this. Smart people have for years been talking about leaving.\r\n-They fired most of HR in 2009 (the others have always been contract workers without benefits); what remains of HR is really weak. HR is never helpful anyway.\r\n-No one \"owns\" decisions (not even managers or their managers!), but everyone gets a say...so few risks get taken and greatness rarely evolves beyond the idea stage\r\n-There's a lot of mediocrity; why improve when improvement might require you or teammates to work a little smarter or harder? Lots of resistance to change that requires more work.\r\n-Flat organization is bad for people whose work shows skill beyond job level / area & typical promotion cycles (senior management encouraged national sales team to think of lateral moves as promotions...even though you don't make more money, get better titles--and then must start the promotion journey afresh as if you had never worked there before)\r\n-Salary. When Google offered me the job, a well-known, respected web property with a similar job did as well. The latter offered me TWICE as much money as Google. Twice! And all the good benefits. \r\n-Salary increases over time. When you're promoted, you don't make all that much more. Bonuses are small (and taxed at 50%). Options are not worth as much as you think. And you don't get as much stock as you think, either. (These are taxed at 50%, too, so you don't really get very much!)\r\n\r\nAll of this relates to the non-engineering side. I always really liked the engineers and when I worked with their projects found great synergies.

There are also a lot of politics surrounding promotions, etc. because of this large middle management structure. It also causes a lot of unnecessary bureaucracy which slows down work and can be extremely frustrating for individuals who are still on the lower rungs of the ladder.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, at least within the sales org, there appears to be virtually no real career path or hope for development/promotion.

Unlike many companies, where employee productivity is dependent already having a certain set of skills needed to get the job done, Google encourages (if not expected) employees to spend a majority of their time doing things they don't currently know how to do. In effect, you are getting paid to learn new skills, and due to the \"act now, think later\" Google mindset, it's generally okay to make mistakes as you learn. World-renowned industry experts regularly lecture at Google, giving the campus an even stronger college-like feel.

Unfortunately, there's too many glassy-eyed Google cultists/lifers who are willing to overwork themselves for a 35% (or more) paycut on projects that may not actually go anywhere. Despite claiming to seek openness, management keeps a lot of secrets-- especially around performance reviews (all employees are graded and rank-ordered, but employees don't get to know how well they fared). \r\n\r\nIn terms of actual productive work, employees are demoralized by having direction constantly changed. I suppose this is known as \"keeping us on our toes.\" Further, it's tiring to hear every team say that they're acting as their own startup within Google, and that team members are going to be hand-picked to be involved in such a prestigious project. It's not uncommon for entire teams to be uprooted or replaced in one fell swoop. Put together, this leads to an uneasy feeling about one's job stability. \r\n\r\nOne final problem: too many Googlers are young, inexperienced, and short-sighted in their understanding of how much power they actually have in developing public-facing products.

In order to being able to commit some code at Google you would need to have a \"readability\" in a language you're writing this piece of a code. It doesn't matter if you have 10 years of experience in that language. It doesn't matter if you have certificate from the company that developed this language. And in order to get readability you would need to write a lot of code in that language. Catch-22. Also, you would have to wait for a pretty long time in the readability queue in order to just start with process. You fill like you lost all the experience you had before with this language. Somebody who has readability and has less experience in this language than you will have power over you. You would have to persuade this other person that your code is OK.\r\n\r\nHypocrisy. They still have courses at Google where they teach you that it is important to have a rest, it is important to manage your energy, it is important to work when you are excited and energized and not work when you're not. This is why they have all those massage chairs. It used to be the company that valued all this. It all changed. I saw my manager writing in 2am and then writing in 6am again. Manager sets an example for it's subordinates and this example is terrible. I also remember my manager writing email about his current state that he is sick. At the same email he tells that \"he will do his best to do some work\". At the same time this same manager tells everybody else that \"if you're sick - go home and take a rest and don't work\". I lost respect for my manager long time ago.\r\n\r\nThey want you to deliver results as soon as possible and yet they don't give you the ability to do it. Instead of JUST DOING IT you would have to write design docs with the future possible architecture (which will always be different because we can't predict software development) and persuade people who have more power than you. Those people will do their best to make sure you don't just start working on your code. You would have to pass several rounds of this absurd.\r\n\r\nThey told me it is very important to predict how much time it would take to finish the project. I asked them what is the technique to predict unpredictable and got no answer in return. They told me it is very important to make sure you did your project as close to your predictions as possible. I asked them what stops people from deliberately giving very large estimates, completing a project sooner and just do nothing for the rest of the time. I got no answer in return.

My experience in Cloud was disappointing, and not a day goes by where I don't regret leaving earlier. My current team, while not perfect, treats me with respect; it really goes to show how huge the variation can be across Google.\r\n\r\nHere are many lessons I've learned in my previous team which I hope will benefit you:\r\n\r\n- If your project is not listed as part of an OKR (Objective & Key Result), no one cares about your project. While most managers will make sure you have a project that can grow your skills and career, many won't and may even try to mislead you into believing your project is more meaningful than it is. Voice your concerns, and firmly ask for a meaningful project. As an L3 engineer, it is not your duty to come up with projects, so your manager has the responsibility to find a good one for you.\r\n\r\n- If you feel your career is going nowhere, transfer to a different team (which can be done without manager approval after 1 year). Do not fall into the sunk costs trap of refusing to leave because you didn't get what you wanted out of your 1 year on the team. For my first half year at Google, I fixed bugs, set up system health monitoring, did deprecations, refactorings, migrations, etc but never had a genuine project. I thought that after a half year of BS work, I would be given better opportunities. Then, I was assigned a monolithic project. I worked long hours to move the project forward. However, our sibling team repeatedly bailed on their responsibilities in the project, and I had to continuously adapt the design accordingly. Eventually, it became clear that our sibling team was not going to contribute anything, and I felt I could no longer leave the team because the project would require significantly more work than initially anticipated. After one year of working on this project, our management decided not to launch without any basis. If you're not treated well after a year, don't think your coworkers and boss will suddenly start treating you well in your second year or even third year. Don't be idealistic or loyal because Google was rated #1 in employee happiness; it's a big company and not every team is the same.\r\n\r\n- Management is perfectly fine wasting 1+ years of your time rather than have an honest conversation about the relevance of your project. On my previous team, this was the norm, not the exception. See the previous bullet point for one example, but this had also happened to my next project, as well as many of my coworkers' projects. The reality is: Managers don't face as much penalty for cancelled projects as engineers. Some managers have 30 reports working under them on a variety of projects, and the performance evaluation has a word limit and a limit of 5 projects. If a project fails, managers can just add more words to the other projects. However, as an entry-level engineer, you may only be working on 0-2 projects, so a cancelled project is much more detrimental to you. The same applies for cross-team collaborations. Make sure the partnering team has a tangible investment in your project. People have a tendency to promise commitments for a reputation boost, but when it comes to actually doing the work, they will flake if there's nothing in it for them. One way to reduce the chance of your project getting abandoned is to make sure your project is part of your team's (or the partnering team's) OKRs. Managers have an explicit responsibility to fulfill their OKRs.\r\n\r\n- In 1-on-1 meetings, do not believe everything your manager says about your career path. Actions speak louder than words. Has your manager been giving you ample project opportunities for growth? Are you getting opportunities for impact comparable to your peers? If the answer to these questions is no, you're not on a strong path to promotion, no matter what your manager says. At Google, performance evaluations are done at a cycle of every half-year. In my second cycle, my manager told me I performed well, and was on track to getting promoted in the next cycle. In the following cycle though, my manager said it may take another 1 year before I would get promoted, even though I never received any indication I had gone off-track. While I would imagine most managers are honest about your career growth, some aren't. By telling you that you have a chance at promotion in the next cycle even if it's not true, they have effectively kept you for another half-year and postponed any consequences for their dishonesty until then. Also, it does not matter if you're assigned an unimportant project or your coworkers failed to do their part. No one is going to say: \"Johnny's project failed to launch, but Johnny did an excellent job and deserves to be promoted anyway\" because it implies someone else should be blamed, and no one is willing to make that sacrifice for you. Also, the promotion committee frankly doesn't care; they need to see measurable impact because that's one of the criteria for promotion, regardless of whose fault it is."}, {"review_title": "Still the best experience of my life", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Jun 2008", "job_title": "Engineering Project Manager in Mountain View, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "In my opionion, Google is truly the best large company to work for.

The people were just as googley, the environment was just as comfortable. I felt part of a big family.\r\n3)  A true care for employees -- benefits are benefits, but I see the heart beind it. I have never felt so taken care of by an employer nor felt an employer go out of its way to make work easy for its employees. From the ease of dealing with the tech stop (our version of technical support), to the overhaul of the mini kitchens to keep us healthy. Everything was done with heart. \r\n4) Indiscriminate respect for all levels -- i worked closely with senior management and never once did i feel slighted. all opinions were considered as long as you had the \"balls\" to bring it up. I felt like a member of the team with real value add from the very start. It was a trip overseas and i was asked to lead a meeting with some officials. I was hesitant and stated my inexperience (i was 25!). my eng director at the time said one thing i would never forget: \"Age and experience is not an issue. You're here now and you know what we need accomplished, so i'm sure you'll figure it out\". \r\n5) Autonomy -- I've started multiple projects at google that have now taken root and have either become part of how the company is defined or have affected change in a meaningful way. None were part of my original job scope, and were ideas i took upon myself to get implemented. It truly is an entrepreneurs' playground -- you need to rally support, obtain resources and push through to completion.

Throw an ineffective HR team in the mix and it is actually not a very supportive or pleasant place to work. I worked in a group that was dominated by men who actively did not like women. My male boss actually stated in a 1:1 with me once that he though several recent promotions were to fill some sort of \"promote women quota\" and that some of the women promoted did not actually deserve it based on their performance or skills. He actually said this to me, a woman. I did mention this to my HRBP and her response was \"do you want me to do something about that?\" A completely inappropriate response. Only young white men from top level universities and very masculine women were hired into our group, I was reorganized into the group my second year at Google and was shocked and disturbed by the environment on the team i joined. Work life balance was a joke and the only appreciation and recognition I received was from the  internal client groups I supported. I would not recommend working at Google to anyone and would say that women in particular need to think long and hard before going to work there. I think there is a lot of bullying, bias and harassment happening in the group I was in and HR should know about this as many people have raised it and no action towards improvements are being taken."}, {"review_title": "Marketing a new product at Google", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Marketing Specialist in Mountain View, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing perks, seriously.
