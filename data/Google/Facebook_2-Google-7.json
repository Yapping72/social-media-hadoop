Maintaining and improving or spending the energy to rebuild and transfer data doesnt get you a promotion.\r\n\r\nYou need to land something, but you also need to excel for over a year this dissuades people pushing to do something to try and get a promotion which is good but also disincentivizing. The whole thing is political, you need to land grab at times to get work other teams might be doing so they can't do it.... again so you can get promoted.

Fast forward to 2020 and we don't even make the top 100.\r\n\r\nThere is a serious lack of coherence and communication anymore. Motivation to succeed is not based on making great products, but instead on what you can do for promotion. This is clearly evident in the products we develop - or develop then abandon. It's also why we once had nine discrete messaging apps while many other products included messaging functions.\r\n\r\nThe world would be a better place if great ideas like Google Fiber, Stadia, and Voice were better executed. However, we're left with products that are not only made fun of by the public, but given countdown clocks to when they'll be discontinued. What remains are disjointed products like Gmail - including a UI so butchered and bloated, they needed to add a loading screen so you didn't think long loads times means the service is down. \r\n\r\nWe once did great work and were on the top of the tech world.

Called \"Perf\", it's a twice a year process that managers and staff alike despise because it takes up enormous amounts of time and results in questionable promotion decisions. \n\nIn Finance, approximately 10% of the team can get promoted in any given Perf cycle and there are only two per year. I recommend learning about Google's internal level system during the hiring process and asking what level your role is before you accept the job offer. Talk to a friend or contact and see if the leveling of your role is reasonable to start with. I was hired at too low of a level and then slow (3 years) to reach my first promotion. \n\nFinance Levels at Google (rough work experience required):\n\nL3 Financial Analyst (1-2 years)\nL4 Financial Analyst (2-4 years)\nL5 Senior Financial Analyst (4-6 years)\nL6 Finance Manager (6-8 years)\nL7 & L7.5 Senior Finance Manager (8+)\nL8 Finance Director (12+)\n\nL5 is the terminal level for many Finance employees. It's extremely difficult to get into management. L6 and above are very political promotions. For promotions at levels 3-5, they are largely time-based (2 years on average for L3/L4, 3 years for L5). Super strong performers do not get promoted more quickly, contrary to what Google claims. \n\nWhile total compensation (salary + 15% bonus + equity) is often competitive, the salary component is quite low and makes it hard to afford the SF Bay Area cost of living, especially in your first year before you get a bonus and before any of your equity vests."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- office perks\r\n- compensation\r\n- working with generally smart people", "cons": "- bureaucracy\r\n- lower connection with teammates"}, {"review_title": "Not excessive", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place for people to work in an environment", "cons": "you don't learn too much"}], [{"review_title": "Best", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best place to work in this planet", "cons": "I haven't seen any cons"}, {"review_title": "Respectful Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Our org shows respect for everyone and allows everyone to have a voice.
