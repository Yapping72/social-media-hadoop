I have listed the pros and cons of the role below. As you can see, the cons outweigh the pros, which is why I left for a different role within Google.\r\n\r\n1. Great way to get your foot in the door in Google. The interview process is relatively easy (compared to SWE) and they are hiring at a fast pace. (UPDATE - Recently there has been news that they are limiting hiring in the USA and have even let go of some employees)\r\n\r\n2. Great way to learn how a growing Cloud enterprise operates.\r\n\r\n3. Get the Google brand on your work experience.", "cons": "1. Not really a technical role. You basically resolve customer issues. There is almost no coding. This is great for people who are not technically inclined but still want to get paid well for support work. But it drained me as I did not feel challenged and had nothing to actually learn as I believe that the only way to learn is to implement things. I am surprised by how many of my fellow TSEs (with MS degrees) were OK with this sort of work.\r\n\r\n2. No opportunities to learn and grow by building a project from scratch. This may seem like a copy of the first point but it's not. Before joining Google Cloud, I had 4 years of experience as a Software Engineer and a Data Engineer at multiple companies. In all of them, you either had a new or relatively-new project that you got assigned to and you contributed to its development. Watching your project grow and get to production is an important part of being an engineer and why I love my line of work. But this is not possible when you are flooded with cases that you need to resolve. Google does allow 20% of your time to work on projects outside of your work, but unless you come up with an idea to benefit your own sub-organization (i.e. Cloud Support), you cannot really include that work in your year-end performance review. I am observing a pattern where GCP is focussing more on hiring interns straight out of college. The good thing is that it prevents them from hiring experienced over-qualified engineers for support work. The bad thing is that many new engineering graduates will accept the fact that solving customer cases is true engineering work and will never venture outside of this proverbial well.\r\n\r\n3. Lot of churn in employees. Based on the above 2 points, employees are dissatisfied. I have seen quite a few people either leave Google or move to a different role after less than 2 years. This reinforces my belief that I am not the only one who feels the same way about this role. This is even true even for senior leadership. During my time working there, I saw a lot of changes in the leadership structure. \r\n\r\n4. Customers are not the most patient people in the world. This is especially true when they are facing an issue and they have asked you to resolve it. I had a particularly bad experience when on a customer call, the customer talked to me like I was a waiter who had made a mistake with his order. Not all customers are like this, but it takes only one to make you rethink your career choices."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer (Swe II) in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great compensation Great tech Onsite Catering for all meals Time for personal projects Great compensation", "cons": "Significant Bureaucracy Long hours overall"}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Learn the best practices - Everyone around you is smart", "cons": "- Roles can be limiting - Wheel in a cog feeling"}, {"review_title": "we did nothing", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "its decent ig but ppretty bad overall", "cons": "very underpaying and brutal job"}, {"review_title": "woo", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Internship in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "so good and employment well", "cons": "not that many cons tbh"}, {"review_title": "Salary", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Accountant in Palo, IA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company Culture and diversity", "cons": "Can be a bit stressful"}, {"review_title": "Good culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Culture, work life balance is drcent", "cons": "Not as entrepreneurial as startups"}, {"review_title": "Fair company", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance and friendly employees", "cons": "Tight deadlines sometimes and not much benefits"}, {"review_title": "review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "gain experience in a high pressure", "cons": "poor management style in a high pressure environment"}, {"review_title": "The Popularity Contest", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Strategic Alliance Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great technology\nGood salary and benefits \nVery smart colleagues and experts", "cons": "Overly political \nToxic culture in Google Cloud due to bad managers that come from laggard competitors with a blow-torch management style. \nOverly focused on engineering and not enough on customers.\nVery strict return to office policies"}], [{"review_title": "daily work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Program Manager in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great place very convientent easy towrk and bwest collegues communicate frrequently and alot of automation\nalot of growth oppurtunities.", "cons": "somes times work is alo0t and stessful bnut at of the day there are ways to deal with that and google is quiet helpful"}, {"review_title": "Senior management", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Management Trainee in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to work at", "cons": "Pay could be better for the industry"}, {"review_title": "Good times, made me happy", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "13 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Perks, good times, and of course the food.", "cons": "Deadlines and some people who did not see the mission."}, {"review_title": "I'm thrououghly enjoying my time", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Product Support Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Merit based promotion process", "cons": "- Large company.
