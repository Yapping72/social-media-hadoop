I have worked for 8 years in industry now. Seriously, there is not a single dumb employee. \r\n\r\n--  Perks\r\nGoogle is the best company I have worked for as far as perks are concerned. Name a perk and Google will beat its rival. Food? Massage? Shuttle service? Nap room ? Doctor? Offsites? Beer on campus? What else?", "cons": "If you join as a Noogler, you will enjoy the perks, free food, massage, infinite offsites, inter-grouplets, events, socials and meeting brilliant people and all that.\r\nBut the moment you start thinking of promotion or career role change, you will start observing this:\r\n--\tExtreme preference is given for manager feedback during performance review cycles. Some managers have no clue about the products they are managing, In such cases, employees who are more vocal and are manager suck-ups get preferential treatment during the review cycles. But engineers who make more contributions, are recognized by peers but who are not in \u201cgood books\u201d  of their direct management or a level above, get penalized. Google should fix this, and fix it NOW, before it continues scaling rapidly thereby scaling this problem with it. So many of its managers are managers just because they happened to be there when Google was 500 people company. \r\n--   You will also observe that there is very little or no chance of career path advancement. This is different from a start-up. If you are ambitious and you haven\u2019t discovered what your technical passions are, best advice is to not join Google. Google makes staying and getting stuck in your job very easy. All those perks are hard to leave behind. There is a fat possibility that you are stuck doing a tiny project that has no impact, no direction and you keep working hard day after day just to realize that the project is doomed to be deleted or has no future. Best bet is to get working on projects such as infrastructure, search or ads.\r\n--\t You have to be in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to changing projects. This used to be easier in early days. Now managers decide your fate. Manager can essentially lock you down for 18 months before \u201creleasing\u201d you to a different project. Google should never take its employee morale for granted, yes, even if it is the most sought after company. There are many brilliant engineers leaving Google, and these are also people with lot of unvested options. Stock isn\u2019t a carrot anymore."}, {"review_title": "It deserves it's \"Best Place To Work\" title.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Dec 2008", "job_title": "Software Engineer Intern in Mountain View, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Google was founded based on the ideals of having a comfortable work environment, and it shows.

Other examples include free bikes, on-site gyms and massages, free shuttle busses around the bay area, and even free co-op cars for employees who bike to work. \r\n\r\nAside from the benefits, the people at Google are also what makes it stand out: you'll constantly be in close proximity to some of the smartest people (albeit some are weird) around. Of course since there are so many projects, the work quality can vary, but I was extremely happy with my assigned work when I was there as an Intern.", "cons": "Since there are so make projects going on a Google, you may be hired and work on something not so interesting. Of course there are opportunities to change your team, it may take a while. Similarly, since some projects are just experimental projects, it's possible that your project is shut down and you're moved to something else.\r\n\r\nThough not technically a 'downside', the only reason I am not returning to Google is because of the lack of hiring right now.

This goes with point #1. You are free to define what can be done in your domain (of course you have to sell it).\n- a lot of basic infra exists and is exceptional. So you don't have to spend too much time on your \"means\" to the end.\n- pay for performance: if you are a good performer, you are taken care of.\n- needless to say, perks are amazing.\n- at Google you will learn a lot of things and you will learn it from the best.

At least when you get promoted, you can feel good that you have truly done something.\n\n- You have to have skill to find impactful areas or projects or start one in order to grow fast. A lot of people can't or don't want to do that. They want it lying there in a platter in front of them (I don't mean this disrespectfully. I have been there). This is why smaller companies or startups look attractive. It's easier to grow in a less competitive place and there is nothing wrong in wanting that.\n In my experience, a lot of people who say Google is boring and young & smaller companies are those that are good at building things and solving problems that a thousand other engineers can solve. They just want a place where it hasn't been solved. At google, a lot of your basic services and infra are built. So the problems to solve get substantially more difficult and requires some lateral thinking as well. Again, no disrespect. There are lot of people out there, including me, who would like interesting problems handed over to us.\n\n- in a place of this size, you have to navigate some political issues.\n\n- in critical systems like search, you can just push new things (rightfully so).

I can make an analysis that makes it look great ) - even if not explicit the pressure to please powerful VPs in Eng is intense.  This is compounded by the hyper-reliance on 360 feedback and networking which means it can be hard to make a change or stand up if something seems wrong.\r\n\r\nFinance is primarily full of investment bankers & consultants, with little folks with actual Corp Finance experience.

Then they don't staff these solutions with adequate Eng resources.  Result is an incredible lack of data availability with the expectation that finance be \"scrappy\" to find ways to tease out or completely guess at the data.

Google is supposed to have a project matrix where tech leads are peers, not managers, but managers commonly flout this and micromanaging is endemic.  Moving between projects is limited by complex procedures and is rarely attempted.   In satellite offices the selection of projects to work on is limited and to make matters worse it is discouraged for engineers to work on projects not centered in their own offices.  Being friends with your manager is a more effective way to get promoted than showing competence.  In fact, showing too much competence or initiative is a good way to earn the ire of your manager.   Performance evaluation is supposed to be by peer review but in reality, feedback from peers is ignored and only the manager's rating is taken seriously.  Political infighting and character assassination are increasingly the norm at Google.  Managers turn a blind eye to it, perhaps because they have found such techniques useful in developing their own careers.  Google base compensation is on the low side, and is supposed to be more than made up for by incentive bonuses, but these are largely illusionary because few employees receive the necessary \"exceeds expectations\" performance evaluation.  Managers at Google tend to consider themselves special people, better than engineers.  Few will bother to greet or otherwise acknowledge the existence of anybody other than another manager if they pass them in the hall.

Since that is a rather vague term, let me elaborate.  Google has established and continues to nurture a culture that fosters, high levels of both work satisfaction and contribution from its employees.  It does this by recognizing the potential in all employees via established work policies, rather than just through lip service, like many companies.  Following are some concrete examples of this:\r\n\r\nPromotion and work performances is entirely reliant on peer reviews.  In other words, to get ahead at Google and to get a positive performance review, you must get positive reviews from your fellow co-workers.  Your manager might love you, but if your co-workers don't like you, you have some work to do.  Managers are also required to seek peer review from those they manage. (I have never seen this before in my career.) Senior level employees from other fields are also encouraged to seek peer reviews from people in other departments.  For example, engineers need reviews from people other than engineers in order to advance.  For this reason, a culture of cooperation is endemic at Google.  This is great because the percentage of \"cowboys\" that seems common at other high tech companies is quite low at Google.  It also fosters an awareness of the type of contribution made by people outside your department, since everyone reviews people in other fields, and therefore must learn a bit about what others do outside their sphere.\r\n\r\nCareer tracks fall into either management or individual contributor.  This is great for people who might want to try management but later decide that they perform best as an individual contributor, or who just want to take a break from management for a while.  In addition, it's not too difficult to switch between tracks.  Finally, managers and team leads are also encouraged to solicit leadership-level contribution from the reportees, as a way to encourage career growth and to share the load, so to speak.  This whole mechanism results in a very strong sense of independence and high-level of function from everyone, because if there is a problem that you think should be fixed, you can fix it and get genuine recognition for it, both from peers and managers.\r\n\r\nYou are required to keep a work log, as a means for you to accurately report on your contributions and as a source for your own assessment and of others' assessment of you.  In addition, there are other assessment tools that are big part of Google work life, designed to keep you mindful of your work contribution and to help you and others write performance reviews.  This sort of sounds tough, but the end result is that you can work to your best and not have to worry about mis-perceptions of your performance: you've written it down.  Additionally, if you are spending a LOT of time working on tasks not related to your main project, your log is a way for you to work with your manager in order to change unnecessary demands on your time.  I would say that this practice exemplifies one portion of the transparency that is so pervasive at Google.\r\n\r\nIdeas and contributions from employees are highly encouraged.  This results in some great products for the company, like AdWords, which was an idea from an early Google engineer, and Gmail, which was a 20% project.  Googlers also gain a lot of company and community recognition for extra efforts/contributions that they feel passionate about, and this only adds to the environment for everyone. As another example, some employees at Google Mountain View worked hard to create alternative means of fresh drinking water for employees, rather than having the company stock water bottles (which contribute tremendously to landfill waste).  This was a big effort. Now we have filtered water stations all over the place--it's not directly tied to \"search\" but it contributed to the company mission to \"do no evil\" and it added to the green image of the company. \r\n\r\nI could go on and on about culture at Google, and I've only scratched the surface, but hopefullly this conveys a sense of what I mean by \"culture\" at Google and how important this element is to a great working environment.", "cons": "From my four years of working at Google, I've seen the following downsides:\r\n\r\n* In sales, management level employees tended to be hired from MBA programs rather than be promoted from within.  I was not personally affected by this practice, but I witnessed the demoralizing effect this had on a good number of very high performers who would have benefitted from a performance-education program so that their level of effort and seniority would have been recognized.  In addition, as is almost always the case from hiring outside management, there was a great deal of frustration from employees because the manager was completely unfamiliar with the culture and process at Google, and this resulted in a feeling of being managed by someone who learned management at Harvard or Yale.\r\n\r\n* Google \"over-hires\" people.  By this, I mean that Google regularly staffs highly-qualified people in positions that are not suited to their level of education.  So, for example, you would see software engineers being hired by support.  That's just stupid.  I appreciate the high standards that Google has for its employees, but I genuinely think they tend to over-correct in that regard, and this results in people not really being suited for the position into which they are hired.  Sometimes it's possible for such people to migrate to other positions within the company to which they are better suited, but often this results in a level of frustration... mostly in this case people find work elsewhere, but in the mean time, this very necessary position must be filled by another hire, which then must also be trained.  Not efficient, and not effective.  Google also tends to focus hiring assessment on academic scores, which is entirely appropriate for new grads, but they do this even for people with multiple years in the field.  That's just silly, and it actually does run contrary to the whole performance process within the company itself, where effort and accomplishments are recognized.  Thus, it makes no sense to disregard this type of assessment for new hires whose professional contribution can far outweigh their academic performance by many years.\r\n\r\n* Google encourages employee contribution to so many different projects that it is difficult for someone to get \"deep\" into a particular project and focus entirely on that effort.  In this, I am speaking from my own personal experience.  I feel that volume of contribution is valued at times over quality or depth of contribution.  There is a sort of \"check list\" mentality where, the more bullet items you can point to, the more you are seen as a strong contributor.  I think there should be more attention paid to contribution to items that are complex in nature and require more focused attention.  for me, it's just frustrating, because I cannot live up to my own level of quality in my main project because of other demands from other projects."}, {"review_title": "Great company and products, spoiled employees", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "29 Mar 2011", "job_title": "AdWords Senior Account Manager in S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great perks and laid back culture.

Everything is measured, quantified and evaluated in terms of growth and impact. Exponential growth is expected in every single metric: number of projects, number of users, lines of code, impact, whatever. If something stops growing, it usually gets killed. Do you remember Google Reader? It stopped growing. Look out for your own stats, and get transferred quickly if you stop growing at your current place.\r\n\r\nLack of focus. Hyperactive and very disruptive development in most areas, with user experience neglected. It is starting to hit back (as of 2014-2015). Unfortunately, I can't go into details on the consequences of this one, due to confidentiality.\r\n\r\nChaos. There is no stable point, everything changes all the time. All documentation is unfinished and/or outdated. Very few people have the 'big picture' and they don't have time to share it, because they have to chase their own growth. Reorganization is continually happening. People come and go, teams come and go, products come and go. Usually we move 3-4 times a year. Noogler onboarding is often forgotten. There's a story about a noogler haunting the buildings for 2 months before finding out whom he reported to. I'm not sure if that ever happened, but I've seen people wandering around for several days. (Now I have the routine to spot them and help finding their team.)\r\n\r\nLong working hours and stress. This is most prevalent in SRE, but many development teams experience it, too.\r\n\r\nCult vocabulary. There are hundreds of words for common things. On top of that, all projects have their internal codenames, and sometimes 3-4 different names refer to the same thing. You can speak whole sentences with words that only googlers understand. Willpower, Ikea, magnet, batman, etc.: those words do not mean what you think they mean.\r\n\r\nLocation-specific issues. The company is centered around Mountain View, and you are almost certainly required to move there if you become important. Other sites (especially non-US sites) provide significantly less perks and choices.\r\nMountain View is extremely crowded, and facilities can't keep up with the growth. Property prices are crazily inflated by googlers, and traffic is bad for the same reason.\r\nLondon still has some office space, but it pays much less than other sites, while living costs are the same or higher. The company sets the salaries based purely on industry average, not on living costs. The London benchmark seems to be flawed. You can't afford to rent any decent flat near the office, and commute is awful during peak times.\r\nOffices are open plan everywhere. Waiting for male toilets is very common at most sites.\r\nWith regards to quality of life, the Zurich site is the most livable in Europe, and maybe New York in the US (until Eric Schmidt applies his stupid crowdedness-makes-you-creative theory)."}, {"review_title": "Google over the last 9 years", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "5 Apr 2015", "job_title": "Manager, Software Engineering in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people are brilliant, motivated, and interesting.

Their conference room layouts make a lot of sense, and the designs and liveliness pouring through those walls were on another level. \r\n\r\n* There are tons and tons AND TONS of teams at Google working on close to anything that you can think of, technical or not, and transferring between them is actually encouraged as long as you're on good standing performance-wise.\r\n\r\n* Feedback is taken very seriously at Google. It's paramount to their culture and it shows: the Food department cares a lot about turning out high-quality food, People Ops does everything they can to make the employee experience a happy one, etc. Even though it's kind-of a talking piece now, the TGIF sessions with Larry, Sergey and top management are unprecedented.\r\n\r\n* The food is quite good most of the time. Some of it's restaurant-quality, even. (It highly depends on the cafe you go to and the food you typically eat.)\r\n\r\n* Aside from a tech startup, I can't think of any other place that's on the bleeding edge of technology at this scale. Google is highly, highly experimental, almost to a fault. (More on that in the \"Cons.\")\r\n\r\n* Their benefits are really generous for a large org. They're not insanely so compared to others like them, but all of the basics (and then some!) are covered. \r\n\r\n* If you like free stuff, Google will bury you with it over time. I didn't work there very long but somehow got two backpacks, a few shirts and a hoodie. Interns get way more stuff, though.", "cons": "A lot of the cons below are projections of my experience at Google. Do a TON of research on the role you'll be applying for. Find people on LinkedIn. Scour reddit. Learn as much as you possibly can about what you'll be doing to try and prepare for what's to come.\r\n\r\n* Your experience at Google will largely depend on your team and/or manager. If you join a bad team and/or a bad manager, you'll be in for a rough 12 months (the minimum amount of time that's usually required to transfer out.)\r\n\r\n* ANYTHING you do or create outside of work is owned by Google, regardless of whether you used their resources or not to do it. This could be a HUGE issue for you if you contribute heavily to open-source and/or like to build side projects. Google's People Ops **do** look out for people doing this too.\r\n\r\n* The compensation is okay depending on where you're coming from, but salary is practically non-negotiable (stock units are more flexible, though) and might not even be competitive depending on your area. Lots of funded startups and finance shops pay significantly better for the same level of experience. Additionally, compensation doesn't scale relative to growth. One could double their salary or more within the same amount of time it takes to get from mid-range to senior at Google.\r\n\r\n* Almost everything that an engineer at Google uses on a daily basis is home-grown and maintained by other Googlers. Much of this tooling is incredibly complicated and takes months to warm up to. This could be a MAJOR brain drain to consider depending on your career path and/or whether you're thinking of staying at Google long-term. (That said, some of the tools were pretty good, though I usually preferred third-party alternatives for many of the others I worked with.)\r\n\r\n* Most of the sexy projects that makes Google Google are in Mountain View, and if you really want to take your career at Google seriously, you'll eventually have to move out there. Living costs in the Bay are insane and show no signs of restoring sanity any time soon.\r\n\r\n* Despite having all of the infrastructure to support it, remotely working is generally discouraged by most teams. That said, many, MANY meetings are done completely or partially with Hangouts and Google's solution for accessing internal resources from public endpoints is probably the best there is. \r\n\r\n* Their interview process is generally terrible. Engineers at Google generally don't like to interview and/or provide feedback, so the interview experience for potential candidates varies wildly across the board. The process also takes a really long time. It took me about four months to get to the offer stage; apparently, that's normal there. (To put this into perspective, I've worked at places that took a week from cold start to signed offer; they can't possibly not be losing talent from these insane delays.)\r\n\r\n* I don't remember seeing more people glued to their phone or laptop in a single workplace before coming here. It seems like almost everyone travels while glued to their phone here. It's maddening. \r\n\r\n* Most interviews are focused almost entirely on technical merit. This makes it (much) more likely for engineers with strong technical skills but (very) weak social skills to make it through the cracks. If you're more outgoing and \"extroverted,\" this might bother you. (It bothered me to no end.)\r\n\r\n* There's lots of exciting work being done at Google, but more exciting work usually means even more operational work. A lot of extremely capable people get slotted into doing that sort of work. Do as much research as you can on your role to give you an idea of what you're getting into.\r\n\r\n* Technical merit is placed above all else as an engineer. Because this is a significant determinant in promotion decisions, a lot of people spend a lot of time doing \"complex and impactful\" work at the expense of things like documentation or maintainability. As you might imagine, this leads to a lot of reinvented wheels and deprecation. (It doesn't help that every project seemingly *has* to have a name to it that might or might not have anything to do with the project that describes it.)\r\n\r\n* Work-life balance HIGHLY depends on your team. In my experience, people at Google that spent a lot of time working after-hours did so on their own volition (for better or worse).

Friday TGIF with beer and wine. Engineers\u2019 qualities are general fine. Many satellite offices so people don\u2019t always have to relocate.

It\u2019s not the best setting for strong and independent engineers to focus and develop solid code. There are such engineers in our office that hardly able to focus and be quiet for more than 30 minutes, always talk loud and flatter each other. I am annoyed and disturbed on an hourly basis.\r\n\r\nProject management: poor project management, lack of discipline and launch schedule. It\u2019s very hard to estimate what and by when project will be launched. There is no one to enforce some discipline on code quality and stability. Launch delay quarter after quarter. When accountability finally comes and the project risks of being canceled, I see desperate launch push and poor code quality.\r\n\r\nManager role: Managers and directors usually stay far away from daily project management duties. Manager does not know what individual software engineer is doing so don\u2019t slightly expect such otherwise you will be disappointed. Majority managers are not technically strong and write zero or negligible code. Don\u2019t expect much technical inspirations or lead by example from your manager. You will neither see much career mentoring nor other \u201csoft\u201d help from the manager. I had 1:1 with my previous manager maybe 3~4 times during the whole year period. Despite being the \u201cmanager\u201d of our project, all his involvement was showing up a few times in our project meeting and later claims making big impact to the project on his self performance evaluation.\r\n\r\nCareer growth: Despite the peer review model, the manager\u2019s feedbacks appear to be what really matter. People that are vocal and suck up to their managers are very more likely to be promoted. If you are hard-working engineer that is able to and like to solve hard problems independently without making superficial noises, and expect Google to recognize your contributions, you will be very disappointed. I know some of such solid and senior engineers; about half of them already let Google. This is very counter-intuitive given the perception people have about Google.\r\n\r\nProject and team: Google is primarily an advertisement (instead of technology) company. The web search infrastructure is awesome however only need a relatively small number of people work on that. The available projects for most people, especially in satellite offices, are limited and not technically hard-core. If you are a senior and talented engineer, you may not find a local project that allows you to focus and solve hard challenging technical problems. It also becomes harder to find other senior talented engineers that you respect and love to work on, given senior engineers are leaving and junior engineers are joining.\r\n\r\nEngineering quality: I am disappointed with the code quality of my current team. Despite Google\u2019s code review standard and practices, too many times people hastily touch existing code or add hacky code with no real testing. Such code checked in and deployed to data center. Overall it requires a lot more unnecessary iterations and bug fixes to stabilize the system. I don\u2019t mind working 60 hours per week at all but it is frustrated to see most time wasted dealing with silly buggy integrated system. There is no engineering process to ensure code quality and stability or make a launch date more predictable. I see a general lack of engineering discipline and experience to implement very solid code from software engineers with no or just a few years experience."}], [{"review_title": "Still a good company, but may not be the best anymore", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Sept 2008", "job_title": "Software Engineering in Mountain View, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Cutting-edge technology, famous brand, good food.

A mess of mindless micromanagement, by self absorbed, arrogant, old-guard types. Everybody manages up, but does not share back down. This is easily the most old fashioned sales management team I have ever experienced. The Cloud sales and sales engineering organisations spend a ridiculous amount of time focused inward on things that reduce time with the customer, while offering no benefit to the customer. Combine that with regular fire drills, where EMEA management needs some information (without communicating why) and everyone! scrambles to provide it, with local management just passing things along, all the while pressuring you about your quota. Speaking of: If you are not in retail, don't even think about having a chance to make quota. Most enterprise customers see no reason to work with Google Cloud and even the sales engineers (CEs) haven't found a reasonable answer to the \"why Google Cloud?\" question that gets asked by almost every account. The new leadership under Thomas Kurian is implementing the \"strategy\" of throwing more sales people at the problem, and trying to play catch up on traditional workloads that make money, but where AWS and Azure are years ahead of Google. Not very creative or visionary. Publicly stating this, is even more damning. All of the DACH sales leadership comes from companies that have lost in the public cloud market (HP, Vmware, etc), but bring their mindset of traditional software sales with them. Finally there is a mix of arrogance (we are Google, we know best) and na\u00efvet\u00e9 (if we build it, customers will come) that permeates the organisation. Instead of adapting industry best practices around sales processes, literally hundreds of people internally spend valuable time in creating over engineered processes  for large deals that almost never materialise. It is becoming harder and harder to consult customer on GCP, because I'm starting to believe that the company will get bored of it, if it doesn't turn a profit in the next 24 months and will abandon it."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work, great resume builder", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Jun 2008", "job_title": "Enterprise Sales Engineer in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Google is in the process of changing the world, or more specifically, how the world uses information.

With a few caveats, anyone interested in challenges should consider working here.\r\n\r\n1. In contrast to recent complaints within the company about compensation, you are well compensated in engineering here. Period. You might be able to find better at a startup or another big tech firm, but make no mistake, Google pays highly overall. Look at the salaries page here on Glassdoor and you'll see that right away.\r\n\r\n2. The office atmosphere in Boulder is great. As a satellite office with experienced-trending engineers, it's more relaxed than Mountain View with most of the same perks. A decent gym, bouldering wall, and full cafeteria are all things to mention.\r\n\r\n3. Work life balance, while very team dependent, is generally superb . I work 8 hours a day, don't carry a pager, and feel no pressure to work more than that. I don't feel the slightest bit of scrutiny if I need to work from home, or go to a comfy nook somewhere out of sight to get some work done.\r\n\r\n4. Again, in contrast to recent complaints from Googlers, the senior leadership at Google (thinking of Sundar here) is *very* open. Find me another 80,000 person company that has its CEO answer crowd-sourced questions on very emotional issues like compensation and diversity.\r\n\r\n5. I generally have positive human interactions here. There's the typical swath of introverted and occasionally awkward engineers, but generally speaking everyone is \"Googley\", i.e. considerate at a level above the average human on the street.", "cons": "The big cons fall into two categories: engineering and company.\r\n\r\nEngineering specific:\r\n\r\n1. The internal tools, compared to open source projects and other companies, suffer from immense proliferation and domain overlap. There are too many ways to deploy code, too many ways to look at a metric graph, too many ways to build a Java library, too many ways to spin up an RPC server, and the list goes on. This ultimately means that none of the products are very satisfactory. There's too much license to \"innovate\" on the fundamental building blocks, and the engineering culture as a whole needs to enforce more standards. \r\n\r\n2. It's an extremely common practice for engineers (i.e. with a title of software engineer) to have direct reports. The result is a bunch of very technical leaders who don't care as much about people operations. This is great when you need backing for a proposal, but sub-par when you need to talk about career development or other non-technical topics.\r\n\r\n3. Technical Googlers are promoted predominately for \"impact\" - think launching a new service, or saving the company $Xm. There does not seem to be heavy motivation to promote engineers who work hard to maintain stable and important systems. It's a running joke that in order to get promoted, it's better to deprecate something reliable and create something new. In other words, Google is an excellent place to gain experience, but to get \"promoted\", you're probably better off seeking out new opportunities. \r\n\r\n4. While mostly good people (especially at a company of 80k), Googlers can sometimes come across as entitled. Yes, finances in the Bay Area is hard even on a salary of $120k+, but the perspective on how much of a privilege it is to work here is sometimes lost.\r\n\r\n5. Google is struggling with some of the same issues that the US is politically. The company has the best intentions, but does fall into a hysteria over \"diversity\". Less than 50% hiring of females in engineering is seen as a systemic problem. Google is slowly starting to realize that this is mostly a pipeline problem, especially considering that the industry (and company) makes enormous efforts to hire existing qualified women.  However, leadership does not seem very interested in respectful but contrary opinions on this topic, as the firing of James Damore demonstrated. If you care about racial and gender equality, but have doubts about a leftist political agenda, you may occasionally feel afraid to speak up at Google."}, {"review_title": "Great perks and culture, but poor middle management", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Apr 2012", "job_title": " in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Google has an amazing work environment.

Also, the availability of free food, gym, etc. on campus and the plenty of fun distractions on its corp network make it easy to spend more time there.\r\n\r\nHard to be visible and make an impact. Visibility and Impact are the economy by which software engineers are measured, and they are becoming harder to come by.

In general, operating margins have been decreasing, although they are still amazing. I'm not saying that legal fees are the reason for decreasing operating margins. Google is investing heavily (in new hires, acquisitions, etc) and any benefits from this spike in investment will take some time to catch up with the costs, and there is no guarantee that they ever will.\r\n\r\nI am a relatively recent (post-recession) hire, and after way over a year on the job I still feel that I am evaluating Google and wondering whether I can have a career here, which is not a good sign. Compared to previous jobs, I feel less recognized, having to work more, less proud of my work, and being more conscious on the effect that specific projects will have on my career instead of just doing what is right for the users/company. It is not that I am less smart/capable/experienced than others, it's just that the opportunities are less compared to someone who joined earlier. The work is not the most interesting I ever done, but it is OK and gives me the opportunity to expand my technical breadth. If this is all Google needs from me, then I am likely to move on, more sooner than later, and if this is a common experience of the relatively recent hires then the smartest and the brightest will not be flocking to Google anymore. Nothing particularly wrong with Google, I assume that's part of a company's normal progression from start-up to behemoth, and I still recommend giving Google a try, especially for new grads as it can be a good place to jump-start an engineering career.

After a grueling week of work, an employee can look forward to a company-funded bender in the form of microbrew beer (both on tap and in bottles!), wine, and the occasional Jell-O shot.

They used to try to take your preferences into account when allocating; they seem to do much less of this as they've grown. If you're at all purpose-driven, you'll eventually become restless at work, looking for something with more meaning than the project you're on. You could potentially 20% something, but that notion has always applied more to some groups than others, and the company has tended to downplay it in recent years.\r\n\r\nMore disturbingly, there's a severe opportunity cost to your side projects: their position is that everything that you do in your personal time belongs to them, although that is not what the employment agreement says and would be an unenforceable position in California. They instead get around this by suggesting that everything that touches the web or mobile (and perhaps the desktop as well) is competitive with them. There's a committee that will examine ideas, but it appears to be moribund.\r\n\r\nGoogle has grown tremendously, and systematized to the point where it's a large machine, needing an increasing number of cogs to keep the engine running. The culture has been eroding recently because the company hasn't been able to reconcile it with its growth, and because the company has sidetracked from its core mission and thrown resources at \"me-too\" projects such as Google+. I predict that this will hurt the company's outlook in the long term, as most of its revenue generation still comes from relatively few core activities which are exposed to market and competitive risks. As it becomes less entrepreneurial, it becomes less able to diversify into new areas, and thus becomes less resilient. I would expect this to take 5-10 years to become apparent (the market would need to shift in a way that causes one of their pillars to collapse), which means that it may not be an issue for most people considering it now.\r\n\r\nOne other thing I've found is that while they care collectively about their engineers a great deal, they're generally not very willing to go out on a limb to make individuals happy.
