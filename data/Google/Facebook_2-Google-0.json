Food and coffee's taken care of and its actually the most exciting part of your day apart from checking out. 2. Massively culturally diverse environment - you get to work with everyone from all over the globe if you're part of a regional team. Everyone's well travelled and you get the best tips for holiday planning 3. If you enjoy doing mindless tasks on top of your job scope which FTEs tend say are \"a huge waste of their time\" - you'll have plenty of that around and you'll be well paid to do that too.", "cons": "If you're considering to take on a temp role or treated like 3rd class citizens by FTEs, this is what your experience will be like: 1. Some white badges have a serious superioriy complex (usually Google purists who have been here >7 years) and truly e joy to refer to you discriminately as red badges or \"TVCs\". You're beneath them so don't expect to be treated with decent human respect. Some senior employees find every chance to diss you for having lower standards than Googlers and remind you that all the benefits you have are extended to you because of their goodwill. 2. DEI only applies to users and not TVCs. TVCs must be kept hidden away from senior management at all times. This includes removing all credit on work you've done and letting FTEs shine on your behalf. 3. Expect your mental health to take a toll if you don't have fellow temps on your team. You often find yourself excluded from team meetings, team lunches etc - and you'll hear all about the fun things they get to do over lunch. 4. You wonder why they hire you to do intern-kind of work even though you've got 10 years of experience. Googlers with less experience tell you what to do because they always know better. I really don't recommend you to stay here longer than you need to because a lot of such work only applies to companies as massive and unproductive as the big G. 5. Watch your FTE friends coast- have nice work-from-overseas-breaks every 2 months while you slog away to keep the ground running. Yet, you're absolutely the dispensable one. 6. They don't like to use outside tools and everything is built in house by aspiring engineers who are tasked to make transformative impact. 7. Everything takes FOREVER to be done here. Global calls all the shots and they don't understand how things work regionally. You find yourself going round in circles. Things that take 1 week to do outside usually gets done here in 3 months. There are just way too many people. No wonder investors keep calling for layoffs. It's too bloated and I have to agree. 8. Extremely messy and bureaucratic. Kind of hard to imagine for a tech company that marketed its employee culture so well. For anyone looking to join Google: 1. Most important skill you'll need to have to survive here: Google slides and google sheets. Throw away your other project management tools. Everything runs on these 2. And youll need to keep track of thousands of these because there's no centralised system to manage your tasks. 2. Don't join unless at a higher level (>L7). Otherwise your influence is 0 unless you do well at influencing. 3. Great brand name to have for sure, but your hard skills take a hit if you stay long enough. You'll definitely hone soft skills though. 4. Networking here is so important if you want to ever get things done. Very extrovert friendly. 5. Meetings galore! Well.. at least they're kept short."}], [{"review_title": "Hahaha", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Security Officer in Bedok New Town,", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good working environment and fun", "cons": "None of it is bad"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Strategy", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Culture, benefits, and interesting work", "cons": "Slow moving organization, not as nimble as it used to be"}, {"review_title": "Good Job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Product Manager in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "compensation is great. just need to negotiate more with HR", "cons": "no cons, it's too good"}, {"review_title": "Good Working Area", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Account Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Environment and good benefit for staff", "cons": "All are nice and good in Google"}, {"review_title": "Food", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Technical Account Manager in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free breakfast, lunch and snacks", "cons": "No cons discovered for now"}, {"review_title": "Overall", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "All of the company provides", "cons": "None of what it provides"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Recruiter", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Culture, people, work life balance", "cons": "US-led initiatives sometimes, disregard of APAC nuances"}, {"review_title": "Really good culture, team bonding and learning", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Talent Acquisition Specialist in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Big community Growing your network great culture", "cons": "the job is limited Hard to grow"}, {"review_title": "Best place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Sales Representative in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Employee and family benefits are unmatched", "cons": "None.

In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  \r\n\r\n4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).\r\n\r\n5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  \r\n\r\n6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a \"con\" to that, too (see below).", "cons": "1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, \"You have to work on weekends/vacations\" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.\r\n\r\n2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too \"difficult.\"  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because \"emotional intelligence\" or \"adaptive leadership\" are not taken seriously.\r\n\r\n3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.\r\n\r\n4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, \"Don't be evil.\"  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :("}, {"review_title": "Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 May 2014", "job_title": "Software Engineer III in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).\r\n* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.\r\n* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.\r\n* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.\r\n* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).\r\n* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.\r\n* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.\r\n\r\nNeither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.\r\n* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.\r\n* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance \"even at Google\" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.", "cons": "* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).\r\n* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.\r\n* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago.

But it can feel brutal.\r\n\r\nYour first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.\r\n\r\nYou'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.

If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.\r\n\r\nWhen you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.\r\n\r\nIt's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance.

Upper management is dodging important observations from employees.\r\n\r\nThe compensation offered by the company is not competitive in light of the current inflation rate, and the issue has yet to be addressed by management. As a long-term employee of Google, I have observed a decline in the company's workplace culture and employee benefits. While the company previously provided various amenities, such as on-site tech stations and holiday events, these perks have been gradually phased out. This trend may indicate a reduction in the company's resources and could impact employee satisfaction. Recently, inexperienced managers from Meta and Microsoft have been hired without adequate consideration for their ability to set realistic targets and provide constructive feedback to employees. Some managers have created a negative work environment, and performance evaluations may not accurately reflect employees' contributions. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, unrealistic targets have resulted in a high percentage of employees not meeting their goals, and the use of performance improvement plans has become common. Due to poor management practices and a manipulative work environment, employees are actively seeking opportunities to either switch teams or pursue new job prospects. In the past, Google has experienced layoffs that were not managed with sensitivity or respect for affected employees. Despite employee feedback indicating a preference for remote work, the company has pushed for in-person collaboration, which can lead to unproductive meetings and a lack of focus. Furthermore, a one-sided performance evaluation system is in place, which may not accurately capture employee input or fairness. \r\n\r\nFinally, it has become evident that managers may not consistently document important follow-up tasks agreed upon during one-on-one meetings with employees. This lack of accountability may lead to misunderstandings and issues, for which employees may be unfairly blamed. In conclusion, the issues outlined above may impact employee morale and productivity, and it is important for management to address them in a timely and effective manner."}, {"review_title": "Best place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Field Marketing Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people, great benefits, and i really enjoy the work i do", "cons": "Some projects can feel like too many cooks in the kitchen.
