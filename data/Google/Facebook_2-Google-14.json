Also, leveling-up gets super competitive due to the large size of the company. Transferring teams is a challenge, so most employees grin and bear it for a couple of years, or leave the company. It's hard for outsiders to understand, but this happens to a lot of Nooglers, and \"re-Noogler\" events are done  for employees that complete their first year. It's unfortunate, but after the \"rainbow-colored glasses\" come-off most new employees burn-out .
