(a lot of that isn't accessible during COVID-19, but the spirit is there.\r\n- Has made significant strides in addressing press-reported D&I challenges, but has more to do (as does everyone)\r\n- Really great products in League of Legends and VALORANT; some true world-class expertise. \r\n- If you're at Riot, you want to be on a game team: League of Legends, VALORANT, even Legends of Runeterra. Wild Rift is more painful potentially... IP/Creative is probably good too. You really want to heavily avoid anything relating to the central teams or \"publishing\".\r\n- This company has incredible potential, but see the cons section below as to why it's a problem", "cons": "Riot is truly a place that struggles because it scaled too quickly and never figured out its leadership layer correctly. So, all the successes of the company are found in the part of the company that is valuable: GAMES. \r\n\r\nThe current CEO, Nicolo is a good person, who ultimately cares a lot about the company and the employees, but doesn't have what it takes to lead. It's just a sad reality. He doesn't know how to create games (he never has done this), he doesn't know how to hold his publishing team accountable (he built it, it's pretty much all he's done in his career and so he doesn't know how truly terrible it is), he doesn't know how to prioritize or focus (his approach is always the biggest bets, not necessarily the smartest bets and he's been unwilling to change anything materially--it sounds big at first, but it ends in status quo), he doesn't know how to delegate (he holds his decisions close to himself and doesn't even delegate to his leadership team). He doesn't know how to set strategy (he just talks big talks about things that have nothing to do with the historic success of the company and are not even necessarily valuable moves--I'm being vague for Glassdoor... but basically distractions). He's also not your inspiration type leader either--that's ok. \r\n but he's very low empathy and pretty arrogant, which makes him gaffe-prone. Under his leadership he has further eroded accountability and has not furthered \"rewards\" for \"risk\"--people internally ask themselves \"why should I bust-ass for Riot? why don't I just go somewhere else to gain more upside or grow?\". \r\n\r\nNow, the truth of this is: this really mostly matters if you're director level up. If you're an incredible IC or Senior, that wants to make games and you've got a dream job on League, well then take it. It'll make you very happy, you should get paid well, and the game teams are legitimate. \r\n\r\nIt matters for directors up because you're the ones who have to deal with this level of top-level incompetence. Riot refuses to get a handle on their social media and that blows up? Boom, you're now stuck in 1:1 with annoyed sometimes entitled employees. You drive impact and are successful? Well, too bad: there's no real growth for you, or maybe it's all going to be decided behind closed doors anyway. There are no plans to have growth, no true mentorship, no skip-level investment. You only advance when someone else leaves or by luck of the constant incompetent org shuffles. Of course, if you've got a great manager you're in great shape. But basically it's all local, be in a great situation, you're in great shape. \r\n\r\nThis all feels like maybe it's getting better... but it's way too slow and poorly executed and just a failure of the top leadership team. They don't know how to empower or raise. They're mostly working hard and well meaning, but this is literally what happens when people are stretched into roles that they are not equipped to do and rise to their level of incompetence. And it's hurting the company--because the great talent is leaving. The thing is there is no true top-leadership team, it's just a collection of some mostly great leaders that don't have empowerment, it's just the Nicolo show. \r\n\r\nHere's the deal:\r\n- Game teams and R&D: The true magic of Riot. These work well.\r\n- Publishing: led by a truly bad leader who doesn't know what he's doing; no accountability. Ridiculously over-funded to the detriment of other parts of the company that need the resources--with not much to show for it (I know, Riot can do pretty awesome marketing, but that STARTS on the game team, or succeeds despite this organization because of a few heroes)\r\n- Central Tech/Riot GO/Central Platform: Really concerning implementation of an idea that could work, but because of bad tech choices, or leadership decisions and the way they are placed is a bit of a mess. Getting better, but concerning.\r\n- HR&Finance, etc.: Both hilariously over-funded and under-funded at the same time. These teams were historically dis-empowered at Riot and so have so much org/tech debt. They struggle to pay it off with their team staff sizes and meanwhile were over-funded historically, but mismanaged, so it's a weird game here. Also, company culture wants to ignore this stuff. It sucks.\r\n- IP/Creative: IP is important, but under-funded; focus should be on games, but is instead getting pulled into other things that are distractions. Can't mandate, always has to partner.

Everything about Riot is dual-edged and requires consistent grounding to maintain realistic perspectives.  If I could summarize, Rioters are given great power.  \"And with great power comes great responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nRiot believes in its cultural manifesto.  Culture drives everything, but it's not as simple as reading and consenting to the manifesto.  Riot culture is a mirror through which Rioters reflect on whether we're winning or losing both as a company and as individuals, and it requires ongoing introspection even after years of working here.\r\n\r\nRiot has lots of perks.  Free meals, parties, international trips, lots of swag, relaxed work environment, flexible hours, unlimited PTO, time allotted to play games, playfund (they will pay for you to buy games), etc.  Riot takes good care of its employees and strives to create a work environment that is fun and challenging.  Many on the outside accidentally mistake this for culture.  It isn't.  Culture is the set of shared values we can agree upon as being important to us and describing who we aspire to be.  \r\n\r\nDuring the interview process, candidates are screened not only on their raw qualifications (what have they accomplished, can they perform the job function), but on whether they demonstrate clear alignment with Riot's cultural values.  Yearly 360-Reviews break feedback down into categories aligned with the cultural manifesto.  A large portion of Riot's senior leadership is focused on how to make sure Riot's culture remains intact as the organization continues to grow globally.  This has some interesting manifestations as it comes to hiring and career growth.\r\n\r\n - Culture is prized more than raw technical ability in a hire.  A candidate may be intellectually brilliant or driven, but will not make it through if they seem to lack humility or a default orientation toward succeeding as a team versus as an individual.  I have witnessed any number of amazing engineers either be passed over as a hire or leave the company because at the end of the day they valued building awesome technology more than they valued how that technology was creating better experiences for the player.  This is neither a pro nor a con, but it is a reality that potential Rioters should understand and keep in mind.\r\n \r\n - Promotion and career progression are disconnected from how \"hard\" one works, who they know, or one's particular work quality (unless that quality is sub-par).  It's mostly a function of one's demonstrated ability to force-multiply; to help their team or other teams to accomplish more and to drive new ways to approaching problems.  \"Senior\" individuals are not looked at as merely having greater expertise than their peers or having higher throughput.  They're primarily viewed as people who are able to create an environment or atmosphere that removes obstacles and makes their peers feel empowered.  Thus, longevity or delivery on mere quantity of features doesn't play well for advancement.\r\n \r\n - Everything is done as part of a team.  Lone-wolves, no matter how brilliant, will not succeed long term.  Individual contributors are not highly valued unless they are also helping to level up the rest of their peers.  Individual quantity, throughput, or flashes of brilliance don't really make up for failure in this regard.\r\n \r\n - Internal advancement to senior leadership is primarily achieved through challenging convention - championing some new idea or problem space - and being able to rally a team around it.  Waiting for a new department to have an open leadership slot is not very effective.  Most senior leaders I've observed that weren't external hires were folks who identified a problem space they cared about passionately, were able to rally others around around it, and ended up proposing and creating the team/department from wholecloth.\r\n \r\n - Management will generally not tell you what to do.  This is good for the type of people Riot wants to attract, not so good for those who are fundamentally task-oriented.  Leaders at Riot want to clarify goals and expectations, but unless you're an associate level, they don't want to tell you what to do or how to do it.  They generally expect that Rioters are capable of thinking for themselves and understand when to reach out to their teammates or leaders for alignment or help.  But individual Rioters are expected to own this themselves and figure out what needs to be done.  This can be empowering much of the time, but also frustrating when a Rioter lacks clarity and doesn't understand how to seek it.\r\n \r\nLastly, on the positive side, Riot's culture of open feedback has created an environment where everything mentioned in this review (both in pros here and the cons below) can be (and are regularly) discussed openly.  Riot isn't a perfect organization - it's made of human beings after all - but it is an organization that craves feedback and opportunities to learn how to be better all the time.", "cons": "Same with the pros above, I don't consider these purely negative, but they do present some challenges.  Most of these center on how Rioters communicate effectively as the scale of the company increases.\r\n\r\n - Hiring feels SLOW.  The need to maintain Riot culture in addition to finding highly qualified candidates can make it feel like you're constantly searching for a unicorn.  It's super important to find cultural fits.  But if your team needs to hire 5 people to succeed, get ready to feel like you're short on resources for the next year.\r\n \r\n - Immature communication channels.  Riot is gradually figuring out how to manage team interactions as the company grows across multiple offices, but this can often be painful.  There is still some startup mentality where people think they can just call folks into a room/meeting and everyone will be on the same page.  This can sometimes lead to a sense that you need to be \"in the room\" in order to have your opinion matter.  \r\n \r\n - Too many recurring meetings.  As Riot grows and it becomes harder to have casual face-to-face conversations with all stakeholders, lots of folks try to schedule meetings as a replacement.  These drain the productive juices out of many participants.  Be prepared to push back on any meeting invite that doesn't have a set, clear agenda.  They will try to take over your calendar.\r\n\r\n - Weak meeting facilitation.  Riot prides itself on being a flat organization.  Bosses don't dominate the discussion and all Rioters are encouraged to participate.  Riot tries to create a meritocratic environment for surfacing ideas in meetings, where anyone is encouraged to speak up at any time.  But without strong facilitation, this often leads to people who are willing to interrupt or those whose style is to \"think out loud\" to be the majority of the voice that gets heard.  This has led to an impression among many that when it comes to getting your vision across at Riot, only alpha personalities are valued.  This is an unfortunate (and inaccurate) perception, but it's not helped by lack of strong facilitation during meetings.  Riot needs to learn stronger facilitation techniques in order to maintain meritocratic interactions without accidentally promoting a culture that values \"waiting to talk\" over listening.  Be prepared to exercise patience here.\r\n \r\n - Side-effects of a strong culture of ownership.  Usually this is a great thing, as it encourages teams to take responsibility for what they create end-to-end without pointing fingers when they assumed another team would handle something for them.  But a side effect one will notice over time is that some teams come to believe they own an entire type of problem space for the company and can become territorial when other teams start to tread in their domain.  This is something management seems sort of aware of and is gradually dealing with over time, but it can be a pain point.  People who excel at inter-team collaboration and relationship building will be most effective under these circumstances.\r\n \r\n - Individual Rioters are responsible for maintaining their own work/life balance.  This is a positive in principle, but I think the company could do more to arm new Rioters with some practical tools & techniques.  Nobody makes you stay late or work weekends, but it's very easy to fall into doing that at Riot if you don't make a conscious effort to stay on top of it."}, {"review_title": "Analyst", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "nice working environment and high pay", "cons": "too intensive work load for me"}, {"review_title": "\ud83d\udc4d", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 May 2022", "job_title": "QA Engineer II", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best QA staff in the industry.", "cons": "Leadership is disconnected from workers."}, {"review_title": "Good place to start career", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "8 May 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent attitude toward players, excellent comp", "cons": "Inexperienced, rapidly changing managers who are held to low standards; from the c-suite on down"}, {"review_title": "Pros and cons as a Riot Games employee", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 May 2022", "job_title": "Senior Graphic Designer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "On-Campus Cafeteria and fairly stocked Pantry, Playtests, Culture, Learning and Development Courses", "cons": "Company culture, Management(Lack of any manager accountability)"}, {"review_title": "Still the best job I've ever had", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 May 2022", "job_title": "Country Manager in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Meritorious\r\nFull accountability\r\nGreat salary\r\nOpen\r\nGreat leadership\r\nNicol\u00f2 is the best boss I've ever had", "cons": "Work-life balance\r\nBeing is Sydney I missed my daily contact with my manager"}, {"review_title": "Amazing people", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 May 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Employees are awesome and welcoming\r\nLoads of room to grow", "cons": "Pressure to take on projects outside of your day to day role"}, {"review_title": "Great job if you want to take it easy and are very social", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Individual Contributor in Santa Monica, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Note: Actual title hidden for privacy since my team was small.

If you like games, the industry and you are starting or early in your career - definitely apply, it will be a great place for you to work and develop yourself. Nowadays, It is more of a corporation than an innovative startup though. It once dared to dream and defied the rules of the game industry establishment, but now it is part of the establishment. So if you are a senior manager and above, be ready for a good old corporate world of politics, incompetent management, zero accountability, and lack of growth opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe good:\r\n- Great talent inside the game studio teams including the executive producers. Go there if you can as it will feel exactly as if you were working in a great game studio.\r\n- Great autonomy for a self-starter: you will define what you think you should be doing, align stakeholders, ship it, then rinse and repeat. You may even grow over time if your role/level allows it.\r\n- The onboarding program is quite good, although be careful with expectations set there. \r\n- True flexible hours, remote-friendly environment (3/2 post COVID), good time-off opportunities. The company\u2019s break during December, sometimes company-wide days off to cope with burnout.\r\n- The Internal Job Market that actually works. Apply to a new role internally once you fulfill your first role\u2019s mission. Do not stay in the same role for more than 2 years. \r\n- The company does sincerely try to be inclusive and some things they do in that regard are good indeed. They do try indeed to improve it.\r\n- If you are from other parts of the game industry the comp should feel fine. But the company is not competitive versus top tech firms and is being open about it. Do not expect any serious comp increases with promotions as all of it is heavily regulated by the talent team.\r\n- post-COVID, you will enjoy a great LAX office with Bilgewater coffee, snacks, free lunch, and dinner, unless it goes away due to the virus. There is a PC Cafe area, plenty of activities you can do while meeting other people (basketball, ping pong, arcade machines).\r\n- The benefits package is good, features a play fund and wellbeing fund as well as good coverage for your family members.\r\n- There is a good deal of understanding of what it is like when you have small kids, especially now.", "cons": "The bad:\r\n- Despite its name (Riot) suggesting a rebellion the company is nowadays a typical game publisher with studios, where unless you are an \u201cindustry veteran\u201d, \u201cshipped AAA titles in leadership roles\u201d BS you likely have no future in higher ranks (inversely if you are game industry veteran - you will do great)\r\n- No real investment into talent or craft, there are only talks and plans and constant promises with no accountability. No serious learning courses and programs. Lack of mentorship and definitely no proper performance coaching.\r\n- The internal knowledge system is basically outdated garbage by now (it used to be OK). So be ready to go through a ton of poorly structured docs and keep in mind most of that can be inaccurate.\r\n- Player focus gets weaponized a lot. You may receive feedback that you are not player-focused while in fact, you do 0 work for players to consume. So it is best to be on a team shipping something to players at Riot.\r\n- Pretty bad change management during org changes. You can get hired to do one thing and then your superiors will expect you to do 3x more and other things without any reset in expectations. And surely expect no conversation about your comp increase or even title change.\r\n- No compensation for overtime. If you are a software engineer and you joined a team with a lot of live incidents, expect to do a lot of on-call duties without any additional benefit (you may take a day off though).\r\n- You will encounter a lot of documents describing what good looks like, such as Manager Expectations, and then learn that no one really holds managers accountable for what they should do. Generally do not expect Riot managers to be good people managers. There are a lot of people in the M category with no clue or actual training to manage people or they simply won\u2019t have time for you.\r\n- The new talent team hired mostly from Blizzard is basically on an \u201coptimization\u201d mission similar to what Blizzard had after M&A.

The founders have not been around in recent years, though Marc is back, which is great for Riot.\r\n\r\nRiot does look after its people in many ways - the benefits (medical, life insurance, 401k match, comp is decent and bonuses can be good) and there\u2019s a nice campus. I guess superficially also with great lunches/coffee and the kitchen pantries that many Rioters like to raid for their late-night weekend gaming snacks.\r\n\r\nThere are managers who genuinely care and also provide great mentorship, but once you get to a senior leadership level, both that mentorship and the Learning Development programs for middle management (and up) are severely lacking. \r\n\r\nThe games are great, well maybe not all - it\u2019s worth calling out the creation and execution of TFT as being incredible (the protection that team got to work in a bubble was impressive, huge credit to LoL leadership and all involved).", "cons": "The current vision and future plans are uninspiring and weak, but when you put Publishing in charge of the company you will become a stolid publisher like many game companies before. In reality, Nicolo\u2019s vision is executed as \u201call the things, let\u2019s not miss out on China and give Jin more\u201d. \r\n\r\nThere is a lack of accountability throughout, especially in Senior and Executive Leadership, which is evidenced by Publishing becoming so powerful despite being the worst-performing area of the company for years (and they defunded the teams that were supposed to measure their performance), but yet their leader just keeps getting more power.\r\n\r\nMany in leadership care more about your \"approach\" versus what you contribute. They ask for your feedback but they don\u2019t really want it, especially if you point out \"the emperor has no clothes\". At this point, be prepared for feedback about being critical, or advised to get aligned or to stick to your lane. You may then hear a narrative about you being negative or misaligned. If you want to progress to VP and above, be prepared to be political but look, this goes for most companies so that\u2019s just life, but it seems to have become worse since the CEO change.\r\n\r\nThe executive team have empowered the vocal minority (i.e. the Slack warriors, who are bitter about everything and whose job seems to be to ensure every social issue is a focus for Riot), while also rewarding many overly political leaders, who drive mostly failure, dish the kool-aid without any substance and never have to worry about being held accountable.\r\n\r\nSo, with the culture changing, reward for performance \u201cstandardized\u201d, and unaccountable leadership who continue to be allowed to get away with anything, the best talent is now leaving (during a pandemic) - many good leaders, upper management layer (who carried the company despite the weak executive layer) and ICs (i.e. the doers). Leadership has a tough job now on their hands to ensure more talent doesn\u2019t leave but it\u2019s mostly of their own making. They will most likely protect themselves and tell their own narrative regarding those who have left were not a cultural fit or were negative, i.e. \u201cdon\u2019t worry, we are stronger now\u201d.\r\n\r\nIn closing, if you\u2019re reading this and thinking about joining Riot, it really depends on the area you\u2019re joining and its leadership. There are many amazing and talented people there (LoL, TFT & Valorant would be the highlights, though they\u2019ve also lost a plethora of talent) but it is a cult and be wary of the narrative. There will also probably be an exodus of talent next March when the final big bonus payment drops."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Software Tester", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of opportunities and challenges", "cons": "Too much work and pressure"}], [{"review_title": "Great company with great benefits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Digital Artist in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing headquarters with brilliant construction designs\nPTO \nFree snacks/lunch", "cons": "Sexism unfortunately still happens within the community \nReally hard to ask for a raise"}, {"review_title": "Rioter", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work-life balance and salary", "cons": "Not much cons in my opinion"}, {"review_title": "Great, but also frustrating", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great product, great aspirational culture, great benefits", "cons": "Real day-to-day culture is many times too far from the aspiration"}, {"review_title": "Cool Place to Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "27 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Senior Manager, Operations", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good company culture and nice campus.\nPeople are amazing and creative.", "cons": "Los Angeles traffic is horrible."}, {"review_title": "Not for everyone", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great to learn some crafts, good to have on a resume.", "cons": "The work environment is all about making you feel that you\u2019re never enough.

This isn't a 9-5 corporate job for sure.", "cons": "Let the witch hunt begin.\r\n\r\nThe single biggest issue with Riot is poor management that refuses to leave because of the lack of liquidity (and can't be fired because they are great at blowing smoke). \r\n\r\nYou have people who may have been good at running a 200-person company years ago but the company has outscaled them. Running a 10x bigger company come with 10x bigger problems. There are also people who are great at surviving rather than creating value. \r\n\r\nThere are people with the best of intentions but an equal if not larger amount of vested people who just want to coast until the next liquidity event. If you worked at Riot for 3-4 years, you will know what triggers to push to bog things down. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed? Don't go. If you want to move the needle, don't go. Not now, for Riot is the graveyard of ambitions. \r\n\r\nThe main consideration isn't innovation, it is protecting the core asset at all costs and milking it (League of Legends). This isn't a bad thing - just a specific business decision. Want to do big things? Go join a startup instead.  \r\n\r\nBonus tip for female candidates: ask during your interviews how many female senior leaders are in the company (zero), and then consider how far you are going to rise beyond junior/mid levels.

I've never known a company so focused on education!", "cons": "I'm echoing everything else that has been said in other negative reviews. It's a sad and sobering fact that none of them are overly dramatic. This place is extremely toxic.\r\n\r\n- \"Bro culture\" and harassment run rampant and pervades leadership. You know those Uber stories going around recently? Riot is a half-step down from those experiences. Your clout and stability are directly proportional to the state of your abs (I'm only somewhat kidding about this). Leadership is filled with privileged men who do not recognize their own privilege and destructively wield their lack of awareness.\r\n\r\n- In order to be successful at Riot you have to do one of two things: 1) deal with an absurd amount of nonsense (this is the majority of Rioters) or 2) play the political game of backstabbing, befriending the right people, and focusing on presentation rather than results or expertise. Nepotism is your friend. It is incredible how many incompetent, unproven people have risen their ways through the ranks just from smooth talking and agreeing with the people around them.\r\n\r\n- Senior leadership is the layer of cancer that infects the rest of the company. More and more \"mercenaries\" are being hired who are looking to not do much and take a lot of credit. There's an obliviousness/naivety to these kinds of mercenaries from leadership (yet obvious to everyone else), and they're always surprised when one leaves the company for more money somewhere else. Some have stayed long-term since they've discovered there isn't a lot of hard work to be done. All they have to do is ask some \"powerful questions\" to cast the illusion that they're adding value.\r\n\r\n- As progressive as Riot is in its employee policies, HR remains the same as every other company out there. They will not help you. They will only help the company. Do not bother bringing to their attention the problems you've experienced; they'll just run you around conducting interviews and not actually address the issue, especially if you have a grievance towards one specific person and that person has a powerful manager. \r\n\r\n- Practicing what you preach is not followed at Riot. Leadership loves to say that it's on you to call out bad people, experiences, people who are \"misaligned\", etc, but god forbid you challenge a leader when they're being hypocritical or doing a bad job. Your career at Riot will end if you rock the boat, even when it's clearly coming from a good place (like being player-focused). If you're perceived as \"complaining\" about an issue, you're done (doubly so if you're a woman). Leadership is void of empathy and loves to spin everything so that you're part of the problem when you bring something up. Phrases like, \"Why don't you do something about it?\" \"Is this the appropriate way to bring it up?\" are thrown at Rioters when they appropriately call out red flags, ignoring the facts that they have already taken the right steps or them calling it out IS doing something because they don't realistically have the power to affect it.\r\n\r\nThis also relates to the privilege part I wrote out above: leadership sings about merit and disregards any real struggles people have when the odds are stacked against them. They fail to recognize that people don't \"rise to the challenge\" in their eyes because they have made it a hostile, unsafe environment to do so, or that issues like sexism make it impossible for people to tackle problems.\r\n\r\n- \"Misaligned\" is a word thrown around by leadership to easily fire people, which really just translates to: \"They hurt my fragile ego and I have more power than them so I'll abuse it right now.\"\r\n\r\n- Diversity is not taken seriously. There is a diversity initiative, but the truth is leadership is not empathetic of diversity and doesn't fully internalize the positives of hiring minorities. They fall into the misguided attitudes of, \"More minorities should just apply\" without, again, recognizing that maybe minorities don't want to for good reason.\r\n\r\n- If you're a woman who is looking to succeed, you're expected to act like a type-A man yet you cannot be TOO loud. The line is extremely fuzzy, so it's easier to err on the side of a female \"yes man.\" It was commonplace to find that feedback included gender-based slurs for women, but not for men.\r\n\r\n- An open feedback culture is encouraged but you cannot give negative feedback to certain people or you will be shown the door. They will ignore the fact that the negative feedback you give is actually constructive and intending to improve the company, but you will be painted as a negative person yourself. It's a very simple, easy defense tactic from higher-ups, and it's employed frequently. Fragile egos, again. Witch hunts are common. Prepare to be called \"difficult to work with\" if you give constructive feedback to the wrong people.\r\n\r\n- It takes forever to get anything done. Trust is not widely available and there are too many stakeholders at any given point, so don't expect to come out of this job with a resume with tangible deliverables.\r\n\r\n- You'll be brainwashed to ignore all of these issues. If you can give into that, I envy you to a small degree."}, {"review_title": "Would recommend", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Maker of Rules", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very exciting and inspiring work", "cons": "Busy schedule, sometimes overtime needed"}, {"review_title": "Decent Benefits but Major Downsides", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Basically the same benefits that have been lauded by pretty much everyone else here: Free snacks and lunches/dinner, unlimited PTO, nice offices, etc.", "cons": "Disorganization is rampant so lots of time and resources are wasted.

Then, out of the blue I was laid off.   \r\n\r\nHowever, it wasn't even the being let go without explanation that hurt the most.  It was the being mistreated at every step along the way.  Seriously no one could tell me for over 6 months WHO my manager was.  They told me I was not a \"strategic thinker\" even though they knew nothing about why I advocated for the changes I did.  They completely disregarded a woman who left in my dept who called sexism when she and I were both overlooked for a position that was then given to a man who had 2.5 years of experience (when we both had over 10 years of experience).  They refused to answer why he was given this role when he clearly had far less experience than both she and I.\r\n\r\nThey then ignored that this man then went on a power trip and would not prioritize any of my work (despite having PROOF that my efforts were in fact paying significant dividends).  \r\n\r\nThat man then  disinvited me to meetings that I should have been apart of and made decisions about me that didn't actually involve me.   He wouldn't respond to communications and questions from me that he knew I need to be successful in my role but he had no problem communicating with the men in the dept.  He would then claim he just forgot to mention it (when it significantly would affect how I worked with the team).   He forced me to work on things that they knew were outside my skill set just to get confirmation biases that I wasn't good and needed help (they then admitted to me that they had done that).\r\n\r\nThey labeled me \"not a big enough gamer\" even though I played more LoL than anyone in my department.  They told me they were open to finding me a better role and then 3 separate times got started and then shot down the ideas.  My then \"supposed manager\" took nearly 2 hours of blabbing rather than admitting I was being let go.  I had to ask him why we were talking for 2 hours with no clear sign about what the conversation was about and had to ask him \"are you trying to let me go\" in which he then responded \"that is what they asked me to do\".  WHO IS THEY?  He wouldn't answer.\r\n\r\nThat man then put his arm around me and tried to coddle me as though I was a child.  Being a woman does NOT make me weak and his insinuation that I needed to be hugged is outrageous.  Some may misconstrue that as  highly inappropriate although I know that was not his intention.\r\n\r\nFinally,  Riot built up a case against me.  They only talked to 3 people I rarely worked with any they knew I had contention with, rathering the speaking to the 12 people I worked most closely with to get feedback.  \r\n\r\nI loved Riot with all my heart when I started.  It was (I thought) the best company I had ever worked for.  I just didn't realize (until after I was let go) that their behavior was NOT related to me, it was related to the fact that I was a woman.  I spoke with 6 other woman in the office who mentioned very similar/same behavior that happened to them.  What a shame when something you love so much, becomes the biggest nightmare you can imagine.

Complete dead weight who take credit as much as possible, shut anything down that's not their initiative, leave early, and are the loudest voice in the room.

I could go on about each of them, but several reviews already do so.\r\n\r\nExpanding on the above, a few point's not called out.\r\n\r\nEntitlement: Entitlement has gone up significantly at Riot and is often found in those with the least reason to feel entitled. The number of people who waste time and have roles where they are accountable to no one has increased significantly since the start of 2015. Work quality and output that was mediocre in 2013 is now the norm.  Play games 2-3 hours a day? Not a problem on some teams.\r\n\r\nCompensation: Perhaps one reason a large amount of the company feels so entitled is the pay at Riot is about 20-35% less than competitors in west LA, if you are below senior leadership level. Your ability to negotiate pay raises is extraordinarily difficult. It is seen as un-riotous to ask for more money and senior leadership often stonewalls monetary requests.  What makes this so much worse than it appears at first glance is the number of senior people who are compensated very well for the work they did years ago and now coast by making so very much more than the rest of us while doing less work.\r\n\r\nPerks: Many perks which people took for granted years ago are dwindling or gone. These lost perks include: WeRiot yearly vacation, unlocked game account, equity in the company, ability to negotiate compensation packages, trips to conferences or events like PAX, and the ability to switch teams to focus on what you are passionate about are all gone or almost gone."}, {"review_title": "Great Workplace, Great Work, Great People", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jun 2013", "job_title": "Recruiting in Santa Monica, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "One of the best things about Riot is it doesn't change it's business model based on what would make money.

Every decision we make is always in interest of players. Even when we screw up, we think about how we could\u2019ve made it better. The mission singularly aligns all of us to use our best judgement to always prioritize what brings the most value to players.\r\n\r\n- Empowerment and growth: Since coming to Riot, and for the first time in my 11 year career, I feel like I can bring my whole self to work. I don\u2019t feel like a round peg getting pushed into a square hole. Not only am I empowered and encouraged to be myself, being at Riot has help mature me into the best version of me. There is an incredible group of peers and leadership that care so much about my growth, that they\u2019re willing to invest hours upon hours in my professional development. This isn\u2019t unique to just my experience - Rioters care so earnestly about leveling one another up, the growth is exponential.\r\n\r\n- Autonomy and entrepreneurial spirit: Rioters are expected to write their own story. It\u2019s up to us to define what our path is, and Riot provides the environment where we can make that happen. Autonomy doesn\u2019t mean going rogue or bulldozing your own ideas - they still require stakeholder vetting and buy-in. What this means is we\u2019re in an environment where we\u2019re encouraged to pursue big ideas, and find ways to make them real, but as a team. Managers also won\u2019t hold your hand and tell you what to do. Riot is constantly working in ambiguity - if you need an ultra regimented or structured environment, Riot\u2019s not for you.\r\n\r\n- Culture: This is what makes Riot special. Riot has such a firm sense of who we are, and who we\u2019re not. The Riot Manifesto is real inside our walls, and there are stories for each one. It\u2019s also a crucible - our limits get put to the test, and it can be really tough if you\u2019re not prepared to handle it.\r\n\r\n- People: Rioters are the most passionate people I\u2019ve ever met - it\u2019s practically contagious. Most Rioters are interested in working as teams to achieve awesome stuff, and are not interested in drama or nasty-politicking.\r\n\r\n- Work/life balance: I used to be in the camp that felt that Rioter work/life balance was really bad, and that Riot needs to step in to manage/coach us better at this. Over the past year I had a lot of personal obligations come up that required me to take time off, sometimes at inconvenient times. I was able to make every wedding and family function last year (and they all required travel). Why was I able to? Because Riot\u2019s unlimited PTO, flexible schedules, and results oriented environment allowed me to make the call if I can get my stuff done in order to commit to these personal obligations. It\u2019s true that Rioters spend a lot of time at work, but we\u2019re also responsible for finding the sustainable balance that\u2019s right for us. We shouldn\u2019t rely on Riot to coach us on how to adopt sustainable behaviors as professionals.", "cons": "- Leadership gaps: Our hiring philosophy tends to favor hiring those with growth for potential over raw talent. This has worked for us, but we now are dealing with major leadership gaps in critical parts of the org. There are bottom heavy teams, where junior managers are managing over 20 reports (seriously). Even though Riot\u2019s identified this weakness and have prioritized hiring leaders in these key roles, there\u2019s lots of chaos between managers, and teams are severely undermanaged as a result until we\u2019re able to find and put those senior leaders in place.\r\n\r\n- Bro culture is real: This comes up a lot in other reviews because it\u2019s true. I perceive that we have a higher male to female ratio compared to previous game/tech companies I\u2019ve worked at in the past, but it doesn\u2019t seem to discourage bro culture at Riot. Default gender pronouns tend to be \u201che\u201d, jokes among team members can be inappropriate, women more often expected to take on administrative responsibilities (even amongst male peers). More recently these behaviors have surfaced as areas we have to improve, and there are groups inside Riot to be change agents - it\u2019s far from being a toxic environment, but is a major weak area that needs to improve sooner than later.\r\n\r\n- Professionalism: Maybe this is a sign that I\u2019m a curmudgeon, but Rioters are rowdy...and sometimes not in a fun way. More junior Rioters run the gamut of unprofessional behaviors: consistently late to meetings (or not responding to invites), inconsistent follow up/through, being super loud in open workspace (especially while playing games), leaving common areas like conference rooms super messy...and it doesn\u2019t end there. I don\u2019t think Rioters do this to be intentionally discourteous, but it\u2019s super frustrating nonetheless.\r\n\r\n- Noise and distraction: It\u2019s just loud. Our open floorplan + bad noise management in the building makes concentration at your desk nearly impossible. I rely on working from home more often in order to get work done - I would normally opt to find a phone booth room to sequester myself in, but with the shortage of conference room space at our current HQ, it\u2019s just easier to stay at home. I hope that this is resolved in our new space /crossesfingers\r\n\r\n- Communication: We just super suck at this, across the board. Teams get spun up and down constantly and many individuals possess tribal knowledge and don\u2019t pass them on to others. There are lots of situations where you find out two teams are working on the same problem, but in different ways, all because they don\u2019t know to talk to one another. We really need to identify how to connect teams locally and globally to one another.\r\n\r\n- Feedback: Riot\u2019s a feedback oriented culture, except Rioters are terrible at giving feedback. It\u2019s common these days for Rioters to assume feedback means it\u2019s critical in nature. There are many junior Rioters that were surprised to discover that there is such a thing as positive feedback. This exists because you have a ton of uncoached people giving feedback in a number of ways, many of which can be either untactful or just plain unhelpful. Riot claims to be good at this, but we\u2019re not. Instead of just saying, \u201cgive feedback to this person\u201d, we need to coach Rioters on the ways to best give and receive it.\r\n\r\n- Culture misfits: I\u2019ve detected a number of Rioters in influential positions who feel like culture misfits - those who are seeking to engage in ugly politics and glad-handing. I worry that because of their senior roles they will poison their groups, but go undetected because of their effectiveness at managing up. Long term this is especially worrisome because the larger Riot is, the more likely the subculture goes undetected."}, {"review_title": "Love the cult or leave!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Nov 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Location in Santa Monica, vicinity to nice lunch spots, hype about the co. that turned out to be yes, just hype, and those who recruited me look like liars", "cons": "Cultural fit seems to be more important than skills or experience.

You are human labor. Not to mention, very often these people hopped onto League after it was already in beta and do not have any experience making and shipping an actual game (vs. just game updates or patches). This lack of expertise is often painfully clear. \r\n\r\n- Some of the company kool-aid is hokey. \"We don't use the 'e' word here.

I joined few months before the game launched, traveled and helped set up multiples offices and I now work in the Hong Kong office. There are already a lot of reviews about Riot Games and I made one something like three years ago. This time, I will then focus more on the Hong Kong office, its pros and cons. \r\n\r\n---- International accountability structure ----\r\n in most companies, a foreign office job is to basically execute in the local country whatever the head office has decided. Or what the regional office (Asia Pacific HQ, EMEA HQ, etc..) has decided.\r\n\r\nAt Riot, the structure is different. The headquarter basically decides and has authority on whatever needs to be the same everyone (like champion balance, company culture or the company logo), while the local offices decide and have authority on stuff that are specific to their territory (like local e-sports, local features, local community, etc\u2026). What it means is that although you won\u2019t have the authority to make a champion, a skin or change game balance from the Hong Kong office (we want the same for the whole world there, so HQ owns that), you\u2019ll have the full accountability and authority on things that matters exclusively for China. This means: no dotted line reporting to another office, no back and forth approval over the ocean, no budget limit set by someone who doesn\u2019t know your market, etc\u2026 If you are an entrepreneur and love action, building stuff and accountability, this is great. Your scope / impact might be more limited than in HQ (although China is a pretty big market), but you\u2019ll have full ownership of whatever project you work on. \r\n\r\n---- Culture----\r\nRiot is super picky when it comes to maintaining its culture in the company. Several interviewers will interview only this area to vet during the interview process. What has been great is the company has not compromised on this when expanding into other countries. This was tricky as some of the Riot culture principles go against the local culture. As a example, the culture of performance and the principle of exiting poor performer which is unusual in some countries. Or the culture of direct and transparent feedback which is sometimes quite unusual in some asian culture. In the example of Hong Kong, Riot brought existing Rioters from different origins (America, China, Europe), but who were all Rioters for at least a couple of years. It helped ciment the culture in the office and have the new hires integrate in the culture right away. The office won\u2019t compromise on culture fit for new hire, even if it means hiring slower than we\u2019d want. As a result, the company culture is also transparent in the Hong Kong office. \r\n\r\n----Office----\r\nThe office is really nice, and capture the same spirit, color scheme and comfort than HQ\u2026 with a great view as a plus! The other benefit is the location: it is based in Central, which means it is pretty accessible from anywhere in Hong Kong with massive public transportation network (buses, subway, ferry, escalators, etc\u2026)\r\n\r\n----Team size----\r\nWhat has been great for a few of us is to work in a small team. Some of our other offices start to be big. Even if we keep an interesting team oriented org, these are still big offices where you often run into people you don\u2019t know. At the moment, the Hong Kong office is just about 20 people. So everybody knows everybody and has good visibility on the rest of the office. \r\n\r\n----Focus----\r\nBecause the office is focused exclusively on China, there is little distraction about all the other things that happened across the company. Several of us worked in other Riot offices for a few years and the ability to just focus on one topic is pretty cool (sure China is a big topic, but still one topic)\r\n\r\n----Partner----\r\nIn China, League of Legends is operated by a partner. This brings pros and cons. Among the pros is this enables a lot of things. We can do stuff in China that are harder to do in other territories. Additionally, when we evaluate new projects, our partner can chip in and help with resources, and thus increase our ability to get things done.", "cons": "----Partner----\r\nOn the other hand, working with a partner means you also have to negotiate sometimes. Although we get full accountability from our HQ, we still sometimes have to negotiate with our local partner. Most of the time we are in alignment, but obviously sometimes we are not. The good news is that we are still accountable of these negotiations in our Hong Kong office. So up to us to improve the relationship or better negotiate when we think it should be improved :-).

This is accounting for a full career in leadership and management roles spanning 20+ years, 10 of which have been in the games industry working for the most recognized names in gaming.  Every place I have worked has had a set of \"core values\", but only 2 of them have ever really shown some belief in those values (Riot being one of them), and only Riot has fully nailed them from aspiration to execution, while truly living those values through their actions, extending to (and especially in) the \"customer service\" side of the business.\r\n\r\nBelow are some bullets of the things that make Riot the top of the list for me: \r\n\r\nEthos/Culture - What you do proves what you believe.  The Riot Manifesto isn't just some catchy words or phrases that a group of execs put together to communicate what they aspire to be as an organization.  It isn't pasted around the office on brightly colored posters pontificating how you should behave to be a Rioter.  The Manifesto and it's guiding principles are the foundation of every action, decision, and endeavor that Riot undertakes.  Each individual is able to articulate how their contribution impacts the player experience, and while the recruitment process is brutal (more on that later), it is designed to identify those that share a deep connection with and belief in those principles.  \r\n\r\nEmpowerment/Trust - At Riot, you can make mistakes as long as you don't repeat them, and as long as you are learning in the process.  I have never in my career in leadership and management roles been so completely empowered.  There are no strings attached, and I know that as long as I am accountable and responsible while demonstrating a strong, guided reason for my decisions, I can do pretty much anything.  That isn't an exaggeration ... I am trusted to make decisions that impact Riot as a whole, and that trust is as common at Riot as grains of sand on a beach.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Stimulation - I am working with some of the most intelligent people I have ever met, hands down.  And I don't mean just smart ... these people are next level.  Riot's philosophy on hiring extreme talent with shared ethos and passion has resulted in a work space that is continuously stimulating with healthy, engaging debate, conversation, and work.  The bar here is exceptionally high, and because of that you are constantly meeting new people that continue to raise your expectation of what amazing is.   Also, I might add, without the pretentious bullsh*t.\r\n\r\nPassion/Engagement - Riot cares, and the people do to.  That is because everyone shares that common ethos and a passion, not just for League of Legends and gaming in general, but for achieving excellence and mastery.  And if excellence has been achieved, they celebrate it ... then raise the bar again.  It is an endless quest for perfection in a group of people that love what they do.  Imagine that for a moment, and what it is like to work with those people every day. \r\n\r\nPersonal/Professional Growth Opportunities - Leveling up is an integral part of being a Rioter.  As I mentioned before, there is an endless quest for mastery and Riot supports this at every turn.  There is a constant stream of educational and development opportunities through a variety of channels, and if there is something unique that you want to do that will help level up both you and Riot (even sometimes not directly related to your current role), there is support for that as well.  As an example, I recently wanted to take an academic accreditation in a specific methodology for leadership, management, and communications.  From start to finish, the approval for this took a day despite the fact that there was a cost associated with it ... that should tell you something about how Riot operates and looks at professional growth.  No one has to tell me that the expectation is that I will take what I learn, bring it to Riot, and level up the other Rioters around me by sharing this knowledge.  And damned right I will.", "cons": "Recruitment Process - The recruitment process can be incredibly brutal.  There can be long delays in communication before and after screenings and interviews, and the overall process is lengthy as well due to the number of people in various locations involved in every new hire process.  They are working on making this process better, but it is still quite painful for many applicants. \r\n\r\nAmbiguity - Riot doesn't really do black and white.  If you are looking for a data and process driven work environment with people telling you what to do and when to do it, you probably wont fit the majority of roles at Riot.   Riot uses data to inform decisions, yes, but context is king.  You don't get to lay back and say \"well the numbers say x so y is correct\".  You have to figure out a lot of things, and in some cases this is great ... in other cases, it is a sign of missing direction or leadership and this is something that Riot is beginning to tackle, though it is pretty rare from what I have seen.   The result in these rare situations is misalignment, which in turn can cause confusion and frustration.\r\n\r\nBlistering Pace - Things are constantly changing and evolving ... some people love this, some people don't.  I love it and thrive in an environment that moves at a fast pace, but I know there are a lot of people out there that prefer a more consistently stable and routine work environment.  Riot really is a culture of work hard, play hard.  If you can't keep up, chances are you will be left behind.  To use an anthropological analogy, Riot is hunter friendly, not farmer friendly.  \r\n\r\nCost of Living - Dublin, while a super cool city, is incredibly expensive in terms of cost of living.  Rents are so expensive that as a sole provider in your family, things can be tight even on an above average salary, especially if you want to live in a family-friendly area around Dublin without a hellish commute to the office.  That can add extra pressure if you aren't prepared for this change when moving to Dublin.  If you are single and going for an entry level role, chances are you will have to find a flatmate if you want to live close to work."}], [{"review_title": "High-risk, high-reward", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jun 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Santa Monica, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Riot's provided a great opportunity to work alongside a group of geniuses on a daily basis.

Not everyone gets to work on a product so many people love.", "cons": "-Veterans are leaving. Leadership will site our turnover stats are low, but this is extremely deceptive when hiring at the rate we are. Across all departments, competent people are voluntarily leaving and senior leaders don't really get why.\r\n-Politicians are winning in senior leadership. Relationship management with Marc and Brandon becomes more important every year. The business has grown too fast around them and they struggle to keep up. This has allowed for smooth talkers and yes-men (they are all men) to slip into highly influential positions while leaders focused on doing actual work get left behind.\r\n-Serious lack of work ethic. Take a tour through the office and look at how many people are playing games, web browsing, or updating their LinkedIn profile. Then ask why League seems to seriously lack many features common to other online games or the last time League shipped a patch without immediately having to disable key content. Marginal features and content get credit as if they are a major release. It's incredibly demoralizing to see how many people coast, which is why ambitious talent are the ones leaving the company.\r\n-Creative Development. This entire department, tasked with expanding the League IP, has directionless leadership, low output, and high organizational cost. The team itself essentially relies on a few creative figures to ship anything: every single other project has failed or been endlessly delayed. Churn is high on the team; seasoned professionals leave without having a single release under their belt. Every single project meets intense executive scrutiny, despite having no bottom line impact and little player impact compared to League. This frustrates both people work on the projects and the rest of the organization; the former because the executive team does not have an expertise in creative work, and the latter because it inhibits their ability to get feedback and approvals, as well as creating the perception that CDev work is way more important and valuable.\r\n-Reorgs every six months. Like clockwork, every six months or so the company goes through a reorg or structural shift. Typically this has no impact on senior leaders but rather their direct reports get shuffled around, teams are broken down and rebuilt, and generally not much changes or improves. It's annoying, costly, and pointless, and has not done anything to solve execution problems.\r\n-Riot's definition of quality or good. The simplest way of creating conflict, delaying or killing a project, and scoring points, is to question or talk about a product in terms of the \"Riot Quality Bar.\" The Riot Quality Bar, an aesthetic imperative, is totally undefined and is not connected in any way to core company values or stated goals. Conversations are supposed to ultimately about player value, however overwhelmingly the topic of the quality can dominate decision-making instead of player impact. Genre-Defining or Brand Values are also used as euphemisms for the Riot Quality bar. The direct consequence of this is general analysis paralysis, circular debating, dismissal of data, slowing output, and an inordinate amount of time spent on elements tangential at best to the success of the core product.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you are someone looking to get things done and make big changes, for now its probably a good idea to stay away. You'll be frustrated carrying your co-workers while leaders take credit, and seeing the huge time cost of meaningless debates around you. It's unlikely the company will be able to ship a seriously game changing product until it's financial situation starts to go seriously wrong."}, {"review_title": "As good as it gets in this industry", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Sept 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "All companies of this size inevitably have issues, but this place by far has the best working environment I've experienced.\r\n\r\nBeyond the benefits (which are amazing), I've never seen leadership take responsibility for the bad things, offer personal apologies, etc. The amount of ownership and  dedication is inspiring.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to many of the other large companies I've worked for, I feel I finally have found a place I can call home.

Make sure you quickly understand which core values the company is living versus ones they are aspiring to (A.k.a. they are very hit or miss on) and you won't be let down. If you are working on something of high value and focus viciously on it, you will succeed. If you succeed, promote it internally through Taste-the-Riot and Show &Tell and you will be given more opportunities to do so.\r\n\r\nThere are many amazing opportunities to learn from the best talent in the industry and if you have a role which touches the game you will feel part of delivering a great game to a passionate player base which idolizes you for the most part. It can feel really great to see how much appreciation players have for your work all over the world. If you care about making players delighted, this is the right place for you.\r\n\r\nSome of the benefits are great. Use them as much as you can since they are a pretty big part of your compensation. Riot is very strategic with its perks, but if you are single and in your 20s you can really capitalize on a gig from Riot. Participate in all the social clubs, spend time at the office or with your office pals, learn Kickboxing, do Yoga, learn to swing dance, go our drinking, go to the gym, etc etc etc.\r\n\r\nSome departments and regional teams have true autonomy. If you are in one of these places, capitalize on this and leverage your creativity and talent to make incredible things happen. The budget is more of a guideline anyway so just make sure that enough player value is delivered and you are golden. If you are not in one of these places find a way to get in with one of the decision makers (your colleagues can tell you easily who those are).

The honeymoon is great in many ways, however I would suggest looking over all the negatives, this is where you can get to the meat of what the issues are. Some may not bother you or affect you, in which case Riot is perfect!\r\n\r\nWhether the place tries to be a meritocracy or not, having a sibling run part of your company is going to cause issues, especially when he is abrasive and unable to show anyone else who is not on the Board any professional courtesy. To make matters worse you have rude and incompetent people being rewarded and allowed to fail repeatedly while other teams have to re-explain the reasoning behind projects over and over after a proven record of success. All this leads to spotty morale for people who are passed the aforementioned \"honeymoon\" stage.\r\n\r\nIf you have sensitivity to bro-ish behavior, crude jokes about gender, ethnicity, age and trolly harassment you should avoid Riot. These are part of the culture in most of the teams except data science and art.\r\n\r\nThe organization has many people who will smile to your face and then stab you in the back when it will bring them even a slight bit of advancement. This is not a problem if you are fiercely competitive and assume this going in, however if you are not a fan of this kind of environment it can be very disheartening, especially in a culture priding itself on transparency and feedback sharing as well as friendliness. \r\n\r\nFigure out who the key people are, build relationships with them and make them feel that you are indispensable for their success. This will pay you way more dividends than competence or aptitude. Granted, relationship management is a key part of succeeding at a job, the skew however for Riot is far more towards relationships and popularity with the right clique. \r\n\r\nFinally, if you are single and willing to room with others or if you are hired as a senior leadership you may be able to afford living in the area.

Riot\u2019s dedication to this topic is based on a belief that aligned people and teams have more autonomy and more inherent trust in each other. Riot is confident in its culture and doesn't water it down.\r\n\r\nPositive: *Meritocratic ideals* I've worked at places where friendship, marriage, or genetic relationships are the primary determinant of who receives the juiciest promotions and pay increases. Riot\u2019s not like that.

Those who are accustomed to \"family\" style environments will have some adjusting to do.\r\n\r\nPositive: *Prioritizes long-term business health* Elsewhere in the games industry, a few companies make deals with their investors that result in behaviors that undermine player trust. In an effort to make certain profit or revenue targets for next quarter, these companies monetize in a way makes discerning gamers gag.

The new HQ looks like it\u2019ll be a wonderful relief, and it cannot arrive fast enough.\r\n\r\nNegative: *Recruiting difficulties* Our recruiting processes aren't something we\u2019re proud of at present. Candidates report very long and drawn-out interview processes (sometimes taking many months), and hiring managers internally are often frustrated by some of the immature process and systems that we use to manage applicant pipelines. Some of these difficulties are typical of companies that have experienced hyper-growth, some of this is attributable to Riot\u2019s extremely high hiring bar that results in a very low ratio of offers-to-applicants, and some of this is just a result of a recruiting and talent operations functions that are still lacking key leaders who can straighten things out.\r\n\r\nNegative: *Immature middle management layer* Because of Riot\u2019s growth, a lot of managers at Riot are first-time managers, and are making first-time management mistakes. This wouldn't be a problem if we had better training for managers and better mentorship systems that paired inexperienced managers with experienced managers to help accelerate the learning curve and minimize preventable mistakes. We\u2019re trying to solve this problem by simultaneously hiring experienced managers (hence some complaints from current Rioters that they feel passed up for promotion) and by building out management training and mentorship systems so that we can successfully elevate more non-managers to management roles. I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll eventually build a very solid management team, but the current situation is recognized to be suboptimal. \r\n\r\nNegative: *Reputation issues* Certain aspects of how Riot operates are misunderstood by some gamers, some press, and some applicants. This is very frustrating to watch from the inside and is a job stressor for those of us who care deeply about seeing Riot recognized in a truthful fashion. Here are two common misconceptions that are particularly bothersome. These things will weigh on you and stress you out if you work at Riot: \r\n\r\n(1) Some players doubt our motivations: perhaps because many for-profit businesses hyper-optimize for profit above all else and also because we move fast and make mistakes in execution, players sometimes attribute our decisions to a desire to put profit first. I wish we could invite groups of players in to our meetings where champions are designed, servers are configured, and decisions are made so that they could see that our teams universally put the player experience first. \r\n\r\n(2) Some former Rioters who have taken to Glassdoor had bad experiences and believe those experiences are representative of the whole. Reading through some of the very negative reviews here, I believe that we genuinely disappointed these people (in part because of the \u201crecruiting difficulties\u201d and \u201cimmature middle management layer\u201d discussed above). But I\u2019m dismayed that these folks believe that the whole company is as bad as their narrow experience. I wish I could apologize to these people and help them understand the bigger picture at the company, because it\u2019s distressing to see them paint the whole company with a broad brush dipped only in the small bucket of their experience."}, {"review_title": "Commitment to Players, Core Values, and Continuous Improvement", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Dec 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Santa Monica, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Riot has some of the smartest people I've worked with in games and tech who are also humble, unassuming and genuinely aligned around a common goal of making great experiences for gamers around the world.

I\u2019m surrounded by some of the brightest people I\u2019ve ever met, and I\u2019m constantly being pushed off my comfort zone by the type of challenges and problems we\u2019re solving on a daily basis. It feels like a truly unique place in Gaming created by Gamers.\r\n\r\nSo, what\u2019s so special about it? Let me try to break it down by sections.\r\n\r\nCareer opportunities:\r\n\r\nRiot Games promotes open feedback culture and the notion of continuous self-development. It feels that you're the sole owner of your success here due to the flat structure and how much freedom each Rioter is given. Everyone is encouraged to share their ideas, provide feedback and challenge the established notions. Though, to be fair, this is harder and harder to do due to the rapid growth of the company. Empowerment is a key word here - everyone is given the opportunity to solve problems and think creatively without being micromanaged. It's very common to hear that we \"hire to elevate\" so that each new hire always pushes the bar higher, or at the very least this is the genuine intent. As a result, there are many opportunities to learn and get coaching from some of the brightest people in the industry today.\r\n\r\nThe company facilitates multiple personal development resources to all Rioters (formal training, certifications, assessments, 1on1s, development plans, mentorship opportunities). Every Rioter can sign-up to a training course with the approval from a manager. And so far in my experience, this is highly encouraged.\r\n\r\nCompensation & Benefits:\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the Compensation is according to the market standards. Sometimes higher, sometimes lower depending on the role and the priority that the company puts into certain areas. For example, Engineering is a high priority area for Riot, so it\u2019s reflected in compensation. Other areas in % terms may be closer to a market standard.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can\u2019t disconnect compensation from the cost of living. The reality, Riot Central campus is located in Santa Monica - an expensive area, so it\u2019s something to consider when relocating from the outside. I recommend doing a thorough research on rent, transportation routes, and general expenses before committing to a decision to move. \r\n\r\nThe benefits outside of salary are numerous and include standard things like private health care, dental care, eye care, free food, and snacks but also numerous not so usual benefits such as travel allowance, gaming allowance and gym subsidizing.\r\n\r\nBut most importantly I feel that the company cares about me as individual and valuing my contribution and provides numerous opportunities to learn and develop my skills. To me, this is the biggest benefit of being part of Riot.\r\n\r\nWork / Life balance:\r\n\r\nRiot Games is filled with passionate people who deeply care about what they do and feel committed to delivering player value. The company\u2019s culture is very appealing if you\u2019re a gamer and often I found myself volunteering my time because I wanted to get something done. And I know many Rioters do the same even if the company doesn\u2019t technically demand that special commitment from you. \r\n\r\nI believe that you own that relationship with the company 100%. After about one year with Riot, I learned how to manage my Work / Life balance better. So, in the end, I think it comes down to the individual to decide how much of that personal time you want to dedicate. \r\n\r\nNow, my line of work doesn\u2019t demand weekend work for example. If you\u2019re in Esports or some Live Services functions, it may not be the same. Riot is big now; multiple functions demand different work schedules, overtime, and commitments from Rioters. \r\n\r\nSenior Management:\r\n\r\nThe leadership team is stacked with some of the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s not uncommon to see legendary game industry veterans walking in the halls of the Central Campus. Now, it goes without saying that Riot isn\u2019t free from politics, as any big organization filled with humans and not robots.

This gets exacerbated by the fact that many early, junior Rioters get promoted into leadership positions, because Rioters conflate people management with prestige. A layer of inexperienced managers has led to the company having a high school-like culture where the personal and professional get mixed up too often. Career opportunities vary greatly across departments, and sometimes opportunities that are great for the company get derailed because they are great for the department or team. \r\n\r\nThese criticisms can get ignored or reasoned away because of the overwhelming success of the company, and instead Rioters will hear that anyone who disagrees either wasn't a \"culture fit\" or couldn't \"align\" with the company or couldn't hack it at Riot.

Barely any adherence to ITIL process and most tech employees I asked about it had never heard of it.

There used to be an all hands type meeting for many years but it was disbanded once the company grew too fast and spread too thin. \r\n* Technical direction is impaired by the above point, engineers are not empowered to know the overall architecture (game loop knowledge training is far too vague and doesn't cover the actual reality of the architecture like it used to because of how much things have changed since that required knowledge was implemented.)\r\n* Cultural hiring process fails to hire experts, instead hiring based on popularity. \r\n* WAY TOO MANY EMPLOYEES PLAYING LoL DURING WORKING HOURS. So much productivity lost here causing systemic laziness. \r\n* Majority of technical side of the company suffers from unhealthy lifestyles.

But the industry and times change as does development.  Riot overall has a culture where they will bring in very high end talent then disregard everything they bring to help increase productivity and move titles to Ship.  The League team functions differently the the other dev teams because its a living product however that has to ship.  Ya gotta keep the lights on basically.  Sadly riot is far more concerned with how you say things rather then work or action.  At times it felt like the company would rather spend millions, and I mean millions of dollars to avoid a few difficult conversations and terminations.  The current management strategy seems to be to throw money at the problem.  The issue with this is that all good things come to an end and if you can't make a new product then having the studio in one of the most expensive areas in the United States starts to be a big problem.  Following that another con is the location of the studio at least in California.  Santa Monica is sky high in living cost.  Expect to pay between 2-5k a month depending on your family size.  Otherwise expect to drive 2-3 hours into work.  I've had on multiple occasions been told by junior artists that changing the workflow was too hard and they where fine with working slowly.  Even if that meant a massive increase dev cost or even worse their co-workers had to work more because of it.  The mid management seems to be the biggest issue there.  I've seen managers actively fire people who they thought that person was a threat to their job or go out of their to manage them out.  This happens regularly to higher end employees, I'd suspect because of intimidation.  Promoting people who should not be in high level roles seems to be the normal, especially on the RnD teams.  Artists that claim others work get promoted to leads while actually good strong devs who knows what they are doing are forced out because frankly there is a large amount of people who don't realize that game development is a job.

No one is actively babysitting you (unlike much of the corporate world these days). Feel free to shuffle your hours around as long as you make all of your (MANY) meetings, which in practice puts a damper on that flexibility. Better stay a couple hours late, so you have time to actually do the work we talked about in all those meetings.\r\n\r\nYour work can touch a massive audience\r\nThat is, if it's in the 5-10% of things we do that actually see the light of day. Most projects are a complete mess and get rebooted constantly. It's demoralizing when players complain about needing feature or product X that we've been working on for years, but will probably never ship due to internal politics. Some Riot time might look good on a resume because of our reach, but don't plan on Riot being good for your portfolio, or your confidence.\r\n\r\nPlay League of Legends at work\r\nYou should, because you'll need some kind of stress relief from the insanity, if you can squeeze a game in between meetings. Again, super cool benefit but kind of hampered by the reality of Riot life. The other double-edged sword is that people get really loud when they play. If your work schedule doesn't match up to your neighbors' prepare for constant distraction as they shout profanities at each other across the room.\r\n\r\nLots of free food\r\nRemember the freshman 15? Try the Riot 20! This is how Riot shows it's love. Catered meetings and presentations, late night dinner subsidies, adult beverages at company wide events. It's really nice for the first few months. The numerous college-aged kids at Riot get excited about it a lot longer, but it's appeal can only last so long.\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\nThis is one of the few areas where Riot shines. Primarily because it is easy to throw a chunk of money at the people team and there's not a lot of politics involved. If your SO doesn't have their own coverage, Riot will subsidize them as if they are an employee, which is a very nice gesture and is probably very useful to some Rioters. 401k match is decent too.", "cons": "Ineffective leadership\r\nTitles don't matter, except when they do. What passes for autonomy here is a lot of theoretical talk about possible directions we can go among the masses at Riot, but the actual decisions are all still made in closed door meetings between product owners and top leaders. Once teams observe this effect, they tend to flail around trying to please the leadership. There's a real sense that no one at the top really understands which of our early decisions caused our success and which were the decisions we succeeded in spite of, so many of our leaders are afraid to make the kind of bold decisions we need to raise quality to where we want it. Painful conversations often just get kicked down the road, so we trudge on with the status quo. Many mid to upper level managers are inexperienced and/or insensitive, causing pockets of poor morale and patterns of avoidance.\r\n\r\nOur values often ring false\r\nOne example: we use that word humbitious (ambitious but humble). Honestly, I think we are starting to fail at both. There's a lack of urgency in the decision making progress, because it feels like we automatically rake in a fortune no matter what we do, so why rock the boat? The humble part is fading too. There are a lot of alpha types that dominate conversations and leave little room for healthy debate. Nobody is really keeping these people in check, and they are found in many leadership positions.\r\n\r\nWe're overly focused on hiring over internal promotion\r\nThe discipline leaders are so focused on desperately hiring as fast as possible, that they aren't nurturing their existing teams properly. If you are currently being wooed by Riot recruiters, enjoy it. It's possibly the last time you will feel like Riot really cares about your growth. There is no clear path to promotion, and it's rare to hear about them. We recently started a regular performance review program, but the reviews don't appear to have any relationship to compensation or title.\r\n\r\nStagnant compensation\r\nIf you join up you'd better darn well negotiate like a boss, because you're getting stuck with that salary for the long haul. Riot is so obsessed with hiring, that it is ignoring the stagnant compensation of it's existing teams. This a growing powder keg that few are talking about except in frustrated whispers, because leadership has made it clear that we should just do our work out of a passion for our players. It seems the managers below them have interpreted that literally to mean no one should talk about money. Ever. Sure, passion is our primary motivation, but passion only stretches so far when you never get cost of living adjustments or bonuses to prop up dead wages and the office is located in Santa Monica, one of the most expensive areas to live in So.

Here's I'll just list a few to help you determine whether Riot Games is right for you.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started at Riot Games, I was like awesome, a game company. After about three months, I would ask myself \"why are they running the company this way? Don't they realize people aren't happy with doing it this way?\" I would bring my voice to upper management--because Riot Games prides themselves on open communication--and management would say \"We don't follow conventions. We like to consider ourselves unique.\" \r\n\r\nOk, I get it. They don't want to run a \"corporate\" environment, but when the company gets to the size they are (>3000 ppl world wide) there needs to be some sort of standard and compromise for growth and communication.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, I would no longer see people that I would normally see. I found out they were \"let go\", but no one could give me an explaination of why. Shaddy if you ask me. \r\n\r\nSo, if you want to work here...be prepared to come in late (11AM) and stay late (past 8PM). If not, you will be considered part of the \"out crowd\". It's true, Riot Games is very frat like. If you're not in the \"boys club\" you're not going to make it. You have to be a bro, do all the bro things, and make Riot Games your life. \r\n\r\nI don't recommend working at Riot Games unless you are new to the corporate world, meaning you don't have any prior corporate experience. Because if you do, you'll be highly dissappointed and frustrated with how management works, or doesn't work actually. Maybe you can join for a year, just to get them on your resume. You might survive.\r\n\r\nIf you love the game, great. Don't make the game your life. Continue to play the game, which is fantastic, but don't make it your life.

It's all about playing politics/pleasing the right people and not getting results. Mark & Brandon's vision on management and culture is what got me to join the studio and it was sad that the walk was so far from the talk. Better you know what to expect and make your decision accordingly. \r\n\r\nBecause Riot is a huge list of teams though, you might get lucky and end up on a team that is very much like the talk. But if you're going to management you better be ready to deal with a load of ambiguous politics and be willing to follow orders without making waves. A mere disagreement with the wrong person can lead you out. Be also prepared to be pressured to bring results and be blocked by the very same people. They somehow expect you to bring results while keeping things the same or not rubbing anyone off in the change process. You were told you were hired to bring results and bring your expertise on how other companies are organized, but in truth you  were brought in to fulfill an illusion and integrate in the status quo like in any other company.  Your success will depend on who you make friends with and who you rub the wrong way. So if you consider the studio with a desire to improve things, have autonomy/liberty of action and no politics you might want to pass. Riot has become a place where you \"align\" or else. Different view points are not welcome. \r\n\r\nIf you're an introvert you might want to pass too as Riot culture promotes assertiveness and scores low on respect of different view points, thoughtfulness and collaboration. The assertive ones win the arguments, not the best idea providers nor the data gatherers. This leads to teams spinning their wheels a lot, with the worst cases being not shipping anything in years...Teams also don't like to depend on each other and rather than fix their communication, they think the solution is to be totally independent from one another which emphasizes frictions. This is quite telling on the organizational issues at hand. Prepare for some pains in getting teams to communicate or work effectively with others to get things done.  I would also not recommend if you're a female unless you're happy to take a passive role, take notes and say yes all the time. You're there to be of service, not to have opinions. While the guys can disagree to the point of screaming at each other , you'll be seen as negative and difficult if you fight for your ideas. \r\n\r\nBeware what people say. Though Riot promotes direct feedback, it's very hard to get honest feedback from people. If you see your manager acting weird there's probably some feedback they're not sharing. Make sure you can trust the people you interact with if you have constructive feedback on the company, as saying anything constructive can easily be perceived as negativity. For those of you confused by the fact that I said Riot promotes fitting in but at the same time the assertive ones win, welcome to what reviewers call \"ambiguity\". You'll have plenty of situations like this at Riot, making it very difficult to assess the right course of action. You'll be told to give your opinions but then your managers will be annoyed because you disagreed with them. You'll be told to take initiative but then your managers and others will be annoyed you didn't ask permission first etc...As a manager I consider clarity to be a key part of my role in getting great performance from my teams so that didn't work for me. \r\n\r\nFiguring out what the true Riot culture is usually takes people a full year. That's no joke. I asked around because I couldn't believe what i was seeing and most of the people I talked to said they struggled here their full first year and some are still struggling to this day because they cannot do anything about the politics which make getting results difficult, and are still pressured to bring results by those same people blocking them. That's only something that can be fixed from the top..."}, {"review_title": "Squandering Opportunities", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Santa Monica, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The work we do at Riot never gets dull.

We have become super risk adverse and are so afraid of making a mistake many people sit in paralysis.\r\n\r\nWe constantly pat ourselves on the back and say how awesome we are and then remind ourselves to be humble in our awesomeness.

If you've ever been a part of the interviewing panels at Riot, it becomes abundantly clear where the hiring delays come from. The moment the interviewee leaves the building, the panel of interviewers get together to judge him/her. This literally involves a Gladiator-style thumbs-up/thumbs-down voting system where you all cast your vote in a circle simultaneously. Then you go around in a circle justifying your vote. You've got senior managers in the room who have only ever worked at one company (Riot), on one game (League of Legends), in one role (for which they were maybe qualified for when the company was 40 employees but no longer), who are making judgments like \"I feel this candidate would make a decent Associate XYZ, but certainly has some growth left before being Senior XYZ.\" - it's mins boggling. In this example, the candidate was a Project Director at Microsoft with 10 years industry experience (longer than the existence of Riot Games) with a stellar track record prior applying for a Senior Manager production role at Riot - a company notorious for having production delays and efficiency problems. This inability to recognize their own shortcomings and projecting instead an elitist culture internally is what disappointed me the most about working at Riot.\r\n\r\nWorking at Riot in any position higher than entry level is a political minefield.

But in reality, each item of the manifesto is either being interpreted in a different way, not being used at all, or weaponized. \r\n\r\nThe visible implications of this are:\r\n- Rioters would prioritize their well-being over player\u2019s experience because the sense of entitlement has never been kept in check. Many employees play 5-6 hours a day. You don\u2019t really need to work hard to be successful (you actually don\u2019t need to be successful at all, just average and quiet). \r\n- Nobody feels accountable for anything meaning that nobody really cares about delivering on time, or simply delivering anything at all. \r\n- Doing anything is always about finding a consensus or getting alignment, never about challenging convention. Challenging convention is actually risky at Riot because you can easily be labelled as \u201ccomplicated to work with\u201d, \u201cpig headed\u201d or \u201cculturally not aligned\u201d. If you really want to push something without getting the approval of 50 people, you better be right because if you are right, leaders will congratulate you for that, but if you are wrong, they will tell you that you should have listened and will not trust you anymore for anything. Simply put, it\u2019s safer to keep it low or you could get blamed for that. \r\n- Since Riot only has one game for now, innovating is always a risk. You don\u2019t want to screw up your cash cow. \r\n- Innovation is also not possible because League has so many things to do to just catch up with the competition (because the team is so slow at delivering anything). \r\n\r\nAnd the results are that: \r\n- Everything takes forever.\r\n- High achievers get bored and leave. \r\n- The ones who stay get frustrated and become either toxic or chronic complainers (labelled \u201csnowflakes\u201d internally).\r\n-Mediocrity becomes more and more the norm. \r\n\r\nAll these behaviours are due to a lack of distinct direction, ownership and accountability at every level. But at the end of the day, individual contributors are not the ones to blame. It is up to the leadership to create an environment enabling every contributor to succeed in delivering value to players."}, {"review_title": "Researcher at Riot", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Jan 2018", "job_title": "Senior Researcher in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- High level of autonomy \n- Challenging problems\n- video games at work\n- competitive salary \n- food, gym subsidy, coffee, other perks \n- sympathetic managers that push you to do your best", "cons": "- \u2018old guard\u2019 leadership still kind of sticks around without providing much direction.

You live close to the LAX office, which is extremely costly in terms of housing and some of the cheaper areas in the vicinity of Santa Monica might not be places where you'd like to live, especially with a family.\r\n2.) Deal with a crummy commute to/from work living further out.  Just be prepared for an hour plus commute if you're anywhere above or below the 405 or past downtown on the I-10.  The 10 in the morning is just ridiculous.\r\n\r\n(-) Work/Life Balance.  This started out okay, but as my department got busier and busier and made additional hires for an increasing number of projects, it slowly got a little out of control.  As I said before, Riot has a lot of great/talented people and I enjoyed working with them, but I enjoy a life outside of work as well.  They had a number of groups and company field trips which were fun, but I don't want to live at my work.  It got to the point where a lot of my friends outside of work were concerned about the amount of time I was spending at work and it didn't slow down the entire time I was there.  Sure, I got OT and plenty of it, but sometimes you need a rest, and having to work twelve days in a row is a bit much.  By the end of it, I was just burnt out and I didn't want to see the office at all.\r\n\r\n(-) Narcissism/Lack of Hubris.  Another poster already mentioned the embarrassing St. Patrick's Day event of 2012, but I agree wholeheartedly with him about it.  The company trip to Vegas was outlandish as well.  I remember walking through the penthouse of the Palms Hotel watching everybody go wild like it was college.  It just seemed to reinforce this false sense of invincibility some in the company seemed to have due to the meteoric rise of League.  I was wondering how Riot wasn't just hemorraging money left and right with all the things they were doing for employees, professional players, business ventures, etc.\r\nAll the lavish expenditures by Riot reminded me of the 30 for 30 documentary on ESPN, \"Broke\", where professional athletes detailed how they spent/wasted their fortunes and advised viewers how this \"invincibility\" you feel won't last once the money stops coming in.  Hopefully for them, they realize it sooner than later.  \r\n\r\n(-) Confusing management hierarchy.  I come from an industry where I might have multiple bosses, but I work with a relatively small number of people that report to one or two supervisors.  Riot had a more corporate structure, which was to be expected, but I felt so much of what I did was being reviewed or questioned by those who had nothing to do with my department.  So much unnecessary bureaucracy.  No, Financal executive, I don't really care for your opinion on my work, as you lack the expertise to give me an informed opinion.  Also, their opinions shouldn't factor in my performance reviews for the same reasons and yet they did because of this nonsense.  I know Riot was hiring at a massive rate in 2012, but don't give employees authority that interferes with my work simply for the reason that they need something to do.  That's ridiculous and inefficient.  So many times I would read an e-mail giving an opinion where I just think, \"Who is this person and why should I care what they have to say?\"\r\n\r\n(-) Issues with the game.  While Riot has hired the best and brightest, there's so many problems the game still has even after 3+ years of its release.  Still no replay system on the live client, still having major problems with server downtime, releasing champions that just absurdly better than older champions, forcing the player into \"buying power\" because they simply cannot grind the IP to compete with people who can.  Unacceptable for a game that wants to be the banner game of E-Sports.  \r\n\r\nThe thing is, Riot is on top right now and popular.  But, without a sense of direction for the game (to make it have more replay value and not get stale) and a reckless spending of money, it will go downhill very fast unless they change course."}, {"review_title": "Tough but very fair", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jun 2014", "job_title": "QA Leadership in Santa Monica, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Freedom to work on numerous projects.

If you can handle the ambiguity that comes from having a goal without an externally-imposed instruction set, this is incredibly empowering. If you can't, you will fail.\r\n\r\nBenefits are pretty darn good - both in the form of standard benefits (health insurance, 401k matching, etc) and in the form of less standard perks (the new office occasionally feels like nerd Disneyland). The space we work in now is incredible, and the people who work to make sure we have a great place to work probably deserve even more praise than I can give them.\r\n\r\nThe problems we work on are incredibly fun - the scale we need to support and the expected level of quality we need to hit mean that you have to stay on your toes and keep growing.

You will have management, but they will be hands-off. If you can handle that, you will succeed, but if you can't, you will fail.\r\n* There isn't enough middle-management to go around. Managers are overtaxed and have too many reports, which means that individuals own even more of their own careers than was perhaps intended.\r\n* Inter-group (particularly between teams and initiatives) trust seems low at times, which is weird, given that trust is one of the cornerstones of Riot's values.\r\n* Things get done slowly - not from lack of hard work or proper prioritization, but because the core technology we work with was not built to sustain the level or kind of use it actually has. Scaling out to support the massive number of players we need to support at the level we want to support them at makes even simple problems into hard problems. Efforts to pay down tech-debt and improve our base scalability continue to improve our iteration speed, but lots of work remains. This can be really disheartening, because players often feel that we aren't working hard enough, aren't working well enough, or just don't care about them, which is as far from the truth as you can get. For me, personally, nothing hurts more than feeling like the people we do this for aren't getting what they want.\r\n* Pay isn't great - it isn't horrible, but if Riot really wants to recruit Google level talent, we need to shell out Google level money - and we don't. Most of that is probably the inherent lower pay that people in the games industry receive, but that shouldn't be a constraint we accept.\r\n* You own your own work-life balance. That sounds like a pro, but for lots of Rioters, that just enables them to have terrible work-life balance and not correct it. Teams and management need to do a better job of setting the expectation of reasonable balance.\r\n* Living in Los Angeles... No, but seriously - LA is expensive as heck to live in and has infrastructure that seems like it hasn't improved since the 1950's.

Here are excerpts from existing reviews that resonate with my experience:  \r\n\r\n\u201cRiot hasn't done a great job scaling, and a lot of how it does business comes from tribal customs and values from when the company was a lot smaller. Some of these values get skewed and weaponized in unsavory ways.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you strive for efficiency, this isn\u2019t the place for you.  If you get stuck on one of these \"wasted\" projects, you will be pretty miserable.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLeadership is often inexperienced and ineffective. Most senior leaders surround themselves with yes-men only and challenging the wrong leader can effectively end your career at Riot.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDefinitely the worst experiences of my career. Extremely type A people, some people don't practice what they preach and many of those people are in leadership positions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDue to the seemingly infinite budget and lack of accountability, this company breeds complacency.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEmployees who don\u2019t agree, or truthfully criticize work are flipping a coin on their job\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCriticisms can get ignored or reasoned away because of the overwhelming success of the company, and instead Rioters will hear that anyone who disagrees either wasn't a \"culture fit\" or couldn't \"align\" with the company or couldn't hack it at Riot. It's hard to gauge how detrimental these factors are, because many Rioters seem happy (or comfortable) with how things are. What sucks is that there's a Riot inside the current company that could be everything it wants to be. It could be kicking down doors and shaking things up, but first it needs to have a serious conversation about some of its problems.\u201d"}], [{"review_title": "Fantastic place to work!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "10 Oct 2017", "job_title": "Concept Artist in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture, wonderful people, incredible campus and a company that truly cares about it's employees and players!", "cons": "Huge teams allow for fantastic content creation - But sometimes lack the ease of communication/creativity of smaller more agile teams."}, {"review_title": "Rapid growth, rapid changes", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Santa Monica, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The folks I worked with were all crazy talented.

Still, content output dwindled as the 'horizontal' culture rested at odds with the unchecked growth. What's left is the worst of both worlds -- any of the massive number of employees can grind production to a halt if they're loud enough, so you get huge teams working in bubbles -- distant enough to make maintaining visibility a serious issue, but oversized enough to make decision making a nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe word 'initiative' is the most abused in Riot's vocabulary. Responsibility and recognition are not earned by being great at what you do, it's earned by loudly championing -something- whether it comes to fruition or not. \r\n\r\nLots of politics, bureaucracy, and red tape. Important teams were having their bandwidth squandered by the aforementioned initiative owners all insisting their cause is worth working on.\r\n\r\nLots of playing it safe content-wise.

Downtown Culver City or the Palms are also great options if you STILL want to be close to \"things to do\", without paying high rents, but if you don't mind a roomate or two, Santa Monica is a great place to live.\r\n\r\nWork / Life Balance: As the company has had explosive growth, sometimes people feel as though it is difficult to maintain work / life balance.  Sometimes people complain about \"mandatory events\", but even our mandatory events have always been optional and usually come with a cool reward.  For example, after our last \"mandatory\" event, we got to see The Dark Knight Rises a day before general release for free...pretty awesome if I DO say so myself ;).  The people that tend to feel this way, In reality though, are those people are those who do not raise visibility that they feel inundated with work.  How do I know?  I used to be one of them :).  As you grow at Riot, your manager WILL give you more responsibility.  However, he or she will ALSO be very receptive to your needs.  If you say that your workload is getting to high, managers are always willing to help and find additional resources to assist.  I feel like a lot of people give Riot harsh reviews because this is their first job in the industry and don't know what to expect or don't know how to say no.  Trust me...I worked at startups where the norm was > 90 hours / week.  At Riot, I manage to still be a top performer and I honestly only work 50 hours on average per week.  Granted...that's not 9-5, but it isn't a sweat shop either as some people have said.  I would say about 2 days / month, I am at the office late because of a deploy or because there may be that occasional live issue.  If you currently work here and you have done all of the above and STILL feel inundated...consider reading \"On Managing Yourself\" from the Harvard Business Review.  It worked wonders for me ;).  \r\n\r\nCommunication: As the company has grown and new departments have formed, effective communication to ALL relevant parties has become more of a challenge.  I joined when we had about 150 Rioters and it was much easier to keep everyone in the loop.  Usually a quick chat with your manager can give you a clue as to who you should be including in your communication with other departments.  Sometimes with regional offices around the world, you can feel the slightest tinge of a game of \"telephone\" where a message gets lost in translation.  This IS something we have been working to improve though.  Having worked with our international offices and almost every department @ Riot, I do feel this more than some people.  I've found that it comes down to deciding in advance what is the most effective form of communication for the audience.  Sometimes a meeting is the most effective, sometimes a powerpoint, sometimes an email.  Sometimes it is a mixture of all three :).\r\n\r\nOn-boarding / Training: Again...as we grew explosively, we are just NOW getting around to putting together many of our training programs.  When I started about 2 years ago, it was very much a \"throw you in the deep end with cement shoes on\" mentality.  People would be around if you started to \"drown\", but you usually were expected to grow organically by asking the right questions.  Now that we're getting bigger, we have gotten more effective at on-boarding new Rioters in their respective departments and also in understanding our core values.  Our mentoring structure has improved dramatically and on-boarding programs have become quite effective.  We still have a ways to go...but we're definitely on the right track.\r\n\r\nTech Debt: As with any company that grew at our rate, we have a decent amount of tech debt that we are now working through.  We're getting better and our automated test coverage is constantly increasing, but we still have a long way to go.  If you do join, I guarantee there will be at least one code base you despise working in, BUT...the great part?  If you really don't like it, I guarantee you can find a team willing to take the time to rewrite it with you.  Over the past two years, I've seen us steadily start paying back our technical debt that accrued during start up stages and the \"despised code bases\" are definitely on a decline.\r\n\r\nNot for Everyone: If you are used to a top-down organization or you don't like games, you probably won't enjoy Riot.  We are hard core gamers and we lead bottom-up.  You'll probably flounder if you don't embrace that ideal or don't enjoy games.\r\n\r\nTrust me...the pros far outweigh the cons :)."}, {"review_title": "By far, best company ever in my career", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Oct 2012", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Santa Monica, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Extremely talented team: you will learn a lot and be inspired by your colleagues. Riot Games has some of the most talented people in the industry and you will feel it within your first days. Riot has a sport team culture / mentality. They will put their best player on their team. it doesn't mean there is no mistake. It happens from time to time. It means they don't value a  family culture of unconditional love. As a result, you can find really ground breaking people and leaders throughout the organization, the ones who are able to raise the bar within the industry\r\n\r\n- Riot games fires: Usually, Riot Games doesn't waste a lot of time with underperforming individuals. This is great. It avoids poisoning the rest of the team\r\n\r\n- Player focused: if you are a gamer, you are going to love the company. The company's compass is the player. We are almost all gamers. The few who aren't appreciate their loss and feel bad (they are not arrogant thinking they are above it). Everybody feels player's frustrations and wishes intimately. It is not a stupid naive conception that some more business oriented folks would challenge. There is a fundamental believe that being player focus will improve the relationship and service offered to the players, which eventually improve company's financial. In my previous companies, you often need to make tough decision, and unfortunately, it very often ends being choosing between cost / profit for the company versus benefits for the players. These dilemma never happens at Riot. Player value is the company's compass since we believe this is the foundation of company's current and future's success\r\n\r\n- Growth and Career path: the company has been successful and growing a lot, opening a lot of opportunities for exceptional performers. If you are are high performer, you will have the opportunity to take more responsibility. You will witness a lot of high performers having more responsibilities and doing more awesome throughout the company\r\n\r\n- Ambitious / Not risk averse: the company isn't shy to take big initiative and risks. Even if it means making significant investment in strategies nobody really pursued. Some examples are initiatives like the tribunal and honor system, international expansion, e-sport initiatives, etc\u2026 when you combine crazy smart idea, talented people and a culture that is ambitious and ready to innovate, you get these industry leading results!\r\n\r\n- Vision oriented: being goal oriented is better than task oriented. I believe Riot does even better since it is more vision oriented than goal oriented. Leaders and managers help contextualize the vision, but let the team set up their own goals and way to achieve those. You will rarely find stupid top down goals like: you have to achieve this number or you have to stay under this budget.\r\n\r\n- Accountability: company gives you a lot of accountability. Very minimal approval / check / up-and-down communication for checking or covering your ass. You will take a mission (often set by yourself) and be accountable for delivery. There is no excuse and very little situation of \"oh i could not do this because department / team / individual X did or didn't do this\". That's personally my favorite thing about Riot\r\n\r\n- People oriented: \r\n     - Compensation is very attractive and is composed of different tools\r\n     - Nice office / Location: the office and facilities are really cool. Location is one of the best of Los Angeles\r\n     - Solid benefits: the benefits, although not perfect, are really getting good and keep improving", "cons": "- Growth challenge: I am sure this would be the number one challenge you'll hear from almost any Rioter. The company is running through some growing pain. For example certain systems and process are still unclear to a lot of us and confusing for new comer. You won't know who does what quickly, and the lack of organization chart (Riot is pretty flat and internationally non hierarchical) won't help. Communication, although very transparent internally, is still a bit messy sometimes between teams / department and offices. By the time we clarify things, new Rioters / Teams have joined making the new system obsolete. \r\n\r\n- Benefits: The benefits are still a little bit behind, also to my opinion due to growth challenge. They are getting there though, for example, pension plan is now offered, healthcare has always been there, etc\u2026 I am confident in the HR / People team though and can assume Riot will be above average by the end of 2012, and probably at top standard sometimes in 2013\r\n\r\n- Requires ability to work in vague environment: this is probably one of the toughest thing, especially for junior people. You will need to be strategic and understand the big picture to define your own goal and path to success as the management style is very vision oriented and not really task oriented. \r\n\r\n- Not family oriented: this is not a con for me but I think this is important to share. Riot is not \"family\" oriented. By that I mean they don't treat people like part of their family. They treat you as part of their (sport) team. So contrary to your family to which you have unconditional love, Riot will have high expectations from you and won't hesitate to tell you if you don't meet them and then let you go if you can't adapt quickly. So if you are looking for job security, guaranteed paycheck, etc\u2026 Riot is not for you\r\n\r\n- Hard work: There is never a \"post shipment\" period at Riot where you can feel \"now we have shipped the game, let's relax\". League of Legends has been growing in content, features, territories and player base for three years and the amount of awesomeness keeps increasing all the time. If you are hoping for a 9 to 5 job, this is not your place. This is not consulting or investment banking either.

Caring is Riot's super power....you can match our teams up against any of the competition and I'd bet on Rioters caring the most every single time. \r\n-Riot provides an insane amount of opportunity and empowerment for an organization of its size. Systemically this causes some issues, but at an individual level if the talent and drive are there you have practically unlimited growth potential. You truly have the support to repeatedly try, fail, learn, and grow.\r\n-Gamer Culture. To outsiders of the gaming world, this conjures up visions of Grandma's Boy-a bunch of dudes playing video games all the time. The actual significance is that to most Rioters gaming isn't just something they do, it's a huge part of who they are. More than reminiscing about old games, the shared experiences connect most Rioters in a special way that directly leads to being able to empathize and make decisions for our players. We know what it's like to have friends you've never met in person. We know what it's like to stay home on a Friday night grinding a ranked ladder. We know what it's like to be disappointed when Developers deceive or fall short on their promises. That's a huge part of our secret sauce.\r\n-There are plenty of teams and offices (not just LA) that haven't lost the magic feeling of Old Riot by finding ways to shield themselves from most of the struggles. Generally, the closer you get to game development the better off you'll be.", "cons": "-I have repeatedly experienced groups and senior leaders at Riot who too heavily weigh decisions based off of their desire for Riot to appear to be a AAA company, as opposed to what will be best for our players.\r\n-When a single music video takes as long to make as some AAA games and that's celebrated, there's a significant cultural problem.\r\n-The co-founders have stepped back from managing Riot and are being replaced by a Trio of very capable old school Rioters. They've all delivered at a high level for a long time, but Marc and Brandon operate at another level. We need to be honest: This is a downgrade.\r\n-Riot is suffering from corporate bloat: Most areas of Riot grew too big, and the result is a diluted talented pool as well as a lot of wasted time and money by people who can't help but create work and distractions for others, detracting from the company's mission to be player focused.\r\n-Product Riot is the name for the group of support initiatives and teams (Talent, Facilities, IT, etc.). It's a group of really smart people, but I find most of my interactions with the group to be frustrating and counter-productive. Instead of feeling like we're working together to deliver to players, I frequently feel like I have to battle bureaucracy, unnecessary process, and people who have lost track of why Riot exists and what we're here to do. Example: I've heard multiple people from Product Riot claim that Riot's mission is to be \"the most diverse gaming company in the industry.\" Diversity is awesome, but that represents a huge misalignment with the mission most of the rest of Riot is prioritizing their efforts around.\r\n-Riot has fallen behind the market in terms of innovation.

Riot is stacked with inspiring talent to learn from.\r\n\r\n- Leadership of Gamers: I've been around the industry and most senior executives don't even play the games they worked on and made major decisions for. At Riot, you're an outsider if you don't play a bunch of games (Marc & Brandon the founders, Nicolo, the CEO, Scott the CTO are all big gamers) - this means they actually get hands-on and deeply understand the games being made (and what player concerns might be).\r\n\r\n- New Leadership: I think Riot has been complacent in the last couple years, the luxury of success on League of Legends meant there was no urgency to innovate. The new leadership at the C-Level realizes that League and the R&D titles no longer have that luxury, and are making hard choices on prioritization.\r\n\r\n- Cares about Rioters: Riot has fantastic perks because they want to keep the talent (that's us) happy. They're one of a handful of companies in gaming that believes their best assets are the people that make the game - and it shows in how they empower teams, manage careers, and invest in Rioters.\r\n\r\n- Big Bets: Riot is betting big on its future titles, and it will be exciting to see them in front of players. Now is the time for Riot to choose which ones to accelerate and to make sure those bets land well for players.

Riot making some difficult choices to make sure the company is on a healthy trajectory. New commitments, long term plans and focus is being applied this year, which means you aren't going to be doing exactly what you did last year. I'm bullish on the future however.\r\n\r\n- Can't be complacent: The demand of Riot change, and you may find yourself called on to help the company win, rather than working on your dream project. At one point Riot let you do whatever you wanted with little demand for business results; that era is ending and a lot of Rioters aren't happy about it.\r\n\r\n- Complexity Drag: As Riot gets bigger, the number of teams, disciplines, and stakeholders that get attached to any project increases. The cost of \"synching what you're doing with team X\" doesn't seem great, but the combined need to sync with a dozen groups creates significant drag on teams.

It's like a sports team, they look for \"all-stars,\" and cut the ones that don't perform at that level.

But that kind of work style is unsustainable in the long run, and eventually it leads to burnout.\r\n\r\nImportant takeaway for those that want to work there: if you don't play the game (League of Legends), you best sign-up and start playing before even thinking about applying for a position.

Bizarrely, in today's market this is a rarity (from my experience).\r\n\r\nA talent focused culture creates an environment where people will go the extra mile, not because their boss is telling them to, but because they are incredibly passionate about what they are doing, and embrace the opportunity to transfer their passion to our players.

This transition is interesting, as that also means a mindset change for the long term HK Rioters who are used to a certain way of working.

Over two years here and I've yet to see a business decision be made that didn't have player value as the primary proposition. Even when revenue is brought up or international publishing concerns are highlighted, the conversation absolutely revolves around players and what\u2019s best for the community.

I've learned more at Riot than I ever thought possible, and I see no sign of that stopping. Everyone is incredibly enthusiastic about League of Legends, and that genuine passion is infectious.\r\n\r\nCulture: Almost everything about Riot I'd describe as \"high energy,\" dialed up to eleven. The culture is hugely focused on self-improvement and iteration. \"Challenge convention\" is a common phrase. Riot underlines how incredibly important understanding the player's perspective is, so we're always playing the game and trying to think globally. Open communication and seeking alignment is encouraged.\r\n\r\nPerks: So many perks... There is endless free food. Catered lunches happen frequently, and there's always leftover sandwiches, pizzas, greek food, etc. IT is always stocked with candy. The beverage machine is only 25 cents a drink. There are show-and-tells and other company meetings with free beer multiple times per month. There's birthday cake for everyone at the end of every month. To offset the incredible availability of free calories, there are dozens of sports and exercise groups that meet up after work... fencing, kickboxing, soccer, dodge-ball, boot-camp, you name it. The gym near the office is also subsidized to $25 a month (Though we'll be moving offices in the next year or so). There's a yearly company trip, all expenses paid, that generally also allows significant others along. Oh, also, you have \"discretionary\" time off, so as long as you don't go crazy, your vacation days are up to you. Baller. \r\n\r\nWork-life balance: Honestly, pretty good. I know many people who work late or sometimes come in on the weekends, but it's by no means expected or required. I leave around 7 PM every day and try to never come in on the weekends. That said, to learn and grow at the rate the company expects, I do sometimes feel that I need to use my free time to study and learn new techniques. \r\n\r\nOutlook: Every year the company is topping itself... the quality of talent coming in is staggering. The game is continuing to grow in popularity, with the eSports scene going from low-production-value streams with a few thousand viewers to record-shattering productions at the Staples Center in the space of two years. When we go on a yearly company trip, it's Las Vegas one year, Dominican Republic the next.  I'm going to try to hold on as long as I can. \r\n\r\nTL;DR - The only constant at Riot is change.

I'm a fairly young developer - I got into the company early, and was able to grow and get a few promotions along the way. I still have some opportunities ahead of me if I work hard, and overall I feel well-served. That said, I also have some more senior friends who feel the opportunities are lacking. I know some who took demotions or paycuts when they joined Riot. I know some who are still in that position after being at the company for years, or who feel they don't see eye-to-eye with their managers on what their compensation should be. Some departments have a reputation of having more stingy managers than others. On top of that, there is no bonus structure similar to many other game companies. Your mileage may vary. \r\n\r\nDevelopment Uncertainty - Everything is in a constant state of change at Riot, which means that teams form and are dissolved constantly. Resources are shuffled around, and sometimes that awesome tool that was going to take a year to make gets cancelled six months in. Sometimes a team changes the game code and then dissolves when you need to ask them how it works. (To be fair on this last point: it is very much known as an issue by management and the engineering discipline is working hard to improve code ownership) In summary, while constantly changing allows us to be really agile, there's definitely some pain associated with constantly re-calibrating."}, {"review_title": "I would be the first to admit that I've drunk the kool-aid, but it tastes delicious.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Jun 2014", "job_title": "Creative Services in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You know that feeling you get when you first start a new job?

I have always been a gamer and to work for a company I admire has been amazing.\r\n\r\nThat said; you should really be sure Riot is the place for you by researching the culture as much as you can. It's laid back but all about high-performance. You'll be asked to live outside of your comfort zone and have no one pushing you to do well, rather you will be given the trust to want to excel. If you wait for someone to tell you to do something around here then you are doing it wrong.\r\n\r\nThe Oceania branch of Riot is also a little different to the rest of the world. We're a smaller team and looking to grow, so while you have access to all the resources of the mother-ship in North America, there are countless situations where you'll be wearing lots of different hats and improvising to get things done.\r\nIt's very startup-esque here. \r\n\r\nWe are always trying to get things done without the benefit of big sprawling teams. Personally I love that, as it makes us able to be flexible and we can make things happen, but that kind of environment isn't everyone's cup of tea.\r\n\r\nThe perks are also pretty crazy, but if that's the reason you're coming on board then I would do some soul-searching first. The writing on the wall about trying to become the most player-focused company around isn't just a slogan \u2013 we live it. The culture here is much like a sporting team, everyone is mates with one another, but it's also about putting the runs on the board.\r\n\r\nAs an example, this is the first place I have ever worked where there are so many high performers in the room that it can be a struggle just to keep up. This should excite you into wanting to level up and be a part of that. I have learnt more working at Riot in less than a year than I did in 3 years at my previous role.

Perhaps this comes from lots of Rioters making truckloads of money when Tencent bought the company, but whatever it is, it feels like there is too much complacency. \r\n\r\n4. Some Rioters lack a sense of appreciation. Some Rioters, particularly those who have never worked a \"real job,\" do not seem to appreciate what Riot offers them.

This stems from the vision and passion of its founders (Marc and Brandon) and it permeates from the top to the bottom of the organization.  The secret sauce that separates Riot from other game companies is that most other game companies are founded by successful game developers who become businessmen by necessity; while Riot was founded by businessmen who love games, who understand how to run a business and understand how important the right culture is to a stellar company, and have enough self-confidence to hire and trust people with expertise they do not have (like engineering and game design).\r\n\r\n\r\n[+] Culture: Openness, excellence, self-awareness, team-focus, low-to-no politics.  Do the Right Thing for the Player (the right intrinsic motivation) and revenue (the extrinsic reward) will come as a consequence.\r\n\r\n[+] Player focus: Worth highlighting even though I mentioned it above.  Note \"Player\" focus, not \"Customer\" focus; that is, focus on the experience for everyone in the game, whether they pay money or not.  This sincere, almost maniacal, focus on our relationship with our Players is the core of Riot's success.\r\n\r\n[+] Really smart people: Talented people who are dedicated to getting even better.  And who are not afraid to hire people smarter than themselves.\r\n\r\n[+] Really cool people: Humble.  Ethical.  Collaborative.  Creative.  Fun.\r\n\r\n[+] Unafraid to part ways: Able to identify people who are not a good culture fit or are underperforming; working with and coaching them to help them meet the bar; but not being afraid to let them go if a path to improvement cannot be found.\r\n\r\n[+] Global reach and impact: The ambition to bring the product everywhere in the world; and the wisdom to listen and work with the differences of each culture and region we support.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the best company I have worked for in my career, but I know we can achieve so much more and have so much more room to improve.  So let's move onto the \"Cons\".", "cons": "My analogy for Riot is that it is a rocket ship on the verge of breaking free of Earth's gravity well and going on to intergalactic success.  The scary part is that we keep adding more and more people to the rocket ship, and the funny thing about rockets is that you need an exponential amount of fuel for each additional person.  That means each new person needs to pull more than their own weight if we want to achieve escape velocity.  The biggest challenge facing Riot is whether we can manage our growth to fully achieve our potential of going to outer space.  But the worst case scenario is not horrible: we'd still be orbiting Earth, and considering how many companies blow up on the launch pad or in the low atmosphere, we will still have achieved something grand.\r\n\r\n\r\n[+] Compensation: Despite our obvious and enormous financial success, the majority of employees, new employees especially, are not sharing in the LoL bonanza.  As far as I'm aware, there are no bonuses, profit-sharing, or additional options being granted.  Riot can get away with paying slightly-above average salaries for its very young staff who are just happy to work on an amazing game at an amazing company, but as its workforce matures, they will need to create a path for them to pay for their kids' college tuition and secure their retirement.\r\n\r\n[+] Culture dilution: As a consequence of extreme growth (from forty or so employees in early 2008 to comfortably over a thousand in mid 2013), it is hard to know if we are maintaining our core cultural tenets with every hire.  The good news is that it is on the forefront of every hiring managers' mind.  The bad news is that sheer size makes it hard to identify people who don't actually fit our culture, and makes it hard to transfer the desired culture from existing \"good\" employees to new employees before another batch arrives.\r\n\r\n[+] Maturity: In many departments, we have hired beyond the capability of the existing experienced employees to train junior employees.  People are talented and full of potential, but that potential cannot be realized without reasonable oversight and mentorship.\r\n\r\n[+] Work/life balance: Riot is not just a job, it's a lifestyle.  This can be good if that's what you're looking for, but it can be bad if you differ from the norm.  Part of the growing pains will be to mature into an environment that can tolerate differing levels of commitment to work hours.\r\n\r\n[+] \"Profoundly Found Elsewhere\": The opposite of \"Not Invented Here\" syndrome.  Early on, Riot had to \"make do\" with the people they could hire as a startup.  The ones that remain were clearly ones that could \"punch above their weight\" when hired, and have been working on one of the most successful games in the world for years.  We are now able to recruit \"big names\" from elsewhere in the industry, and we put a lot of effort and creativity into wooing and recruiting them.  But I feel we do not have anywhere near the same respect for, or expend as much effort or creativity to keep and reward, the people we already have.  This has most recently manifested in an entire layer of leadership hired in above existing employees.\r\n\r\n[+] Inner circle: As a consequence of our rampant growth, the visiblity that upper management has of the day-to-day in the trenches and the access employees have to upper management has naturally gone down.  There is now an inner circle of trusted advisors that drive the major strategic decisions of the company, and you have to be in the good graces of someone who has influence to enact high-level change at the company.  Riot is still one of the most open and agile companies I've worked for, and it continues to do things to break down these barriers with smaller town-hall meetings with Marc & Brandon.  But the President of the United States has a Cabinet for a reason -- he doesn't have the time to listen to every citizen armchair-expert before making key decisions.  This may very well be the simple consequence of scale; but I do mourn the very flat and direct hierarchy we had when the company was much smaller.\r\n\r\n[+] Cult of heroics: Riot values the ability of a single hero (or small team of heroes) to rise up to the challenge and excel the way out of a crisis.  But just because we're good at fighting fires does not mean we should start them or ignore them when they're small.  As we mature, we need to create an environment where we have heroes but no heroics -- that is, people that could step up to any emergency, but develop, plan, and work in such a way that crises do not occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important thing to note here is that Riot has a deep dedication to continuous improvement.  I have every confidence that we will be able to address these \"Cons\" as long as we stay true to our core tenets."}, {"review_title": "Great experience - if you love games and like being challenged", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Sept 2013", "job_title": "Some Sort of Management in Santa Monica, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- People here really do love games, especially LoL.

In order to make this real every day, Rioters have to possess strong self-awareness, situational awareness, an upbeat sense of togetherness and an ever-present entrepreneurial streak. Reading some of Riot's reviews on here, some submitters appear to consider these things cons. They are, in fact, demands that grow individuals in ways they may never see in other parts of their career. As such, they are enormous pros.\r\n\r\nI'm surrounded by people with whom I can default to trust; people I know will have my back whenever I need it (not just when I ask for it). They possess extraordinary domain expertise but are most focused on what they don't know (as an expression of their humility and their drive to grow). They have a genuine determination to build things of value and to have fun while they do it.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of determination, Riot is not a fairytale. Like anything worthwhile and enduring, it takes love, work and faith. One of the things I like most about Riot (and the way I know it's not a cult or some sort of fraternity) is the level of recognition it has collectively that 'getting it wrong' is a normal part of doing something of value. There is a notable persistence with which Rioters try to address shortcomings whenever they happen, whatever they are and whomever they involve. Sometimes problems will seem trivial, sometimes insurmountable, but there is always a resolve to reflect and move forward together.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Riot has such a strong feedback culture and that Rioters take their duty of care to each others' development so seriously is what has allowed Riot to retain its soul as it has scaled.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Rioters keep trying, with humility, to do better in the face of success and failure. They do this, overwhelmingly, without compromising their principles. This is the very definition of character and it is what makes me most proud to be a member of this family.", "cons": "Riot continues to grow quickly. As a manager, some of the tools and systems I use to help care for people are a little behind the curve - which is both completely expected and being visibly addressed. For now, however, as Riot finds its feet with respect to some of the more 'run-of-the-mill' bits of operating a business with thousands of people, these shortfalls are noticeable and do have a drag coefficient.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, Riot's culture is a self-directed one. It's a very flat organization and the tools in general for helping Rioters navigate, coalesce and self-organize also need to be leveled-up. Again, this is being visibly addressed but the use of social networks and tacit knowledge as a substitute for some of these tools is currently one of the more intimidating things about working at Riot. Not a deal breaker, but unnecessary friction to be sure."}, {"review_title": "Shot-caller or back-up player, it's in your hands", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Hong Kong", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I personally love this company, and like its mission statement, this company is literally one of THE most player-focused companies I have ever had the opportunity to work for.

If you did something that others don't agree, they will voice it out. The reason I say I love this is because constructive feedback is the reason that people can keep growing, but at the same time, this isn't a method for all people.\r\n\r\nOne more thing I'd like to mention is the policy of having no titles in the office to reduce the hierarchical ladder in China. This gives new employees all the freedom to talk to anyone in the office about a problem or concern without having to think if they stepped over the line per se. And while this policy  is in place, employees feel more empowered to work on the projects they love, instead of being limited to a certain job forever.", "cons": "As I already mentioned in the pros, the word \"default trust\" is thrown around all the time, and yes, people do actually trust the Product Owner (PO) in his/her judgement when decisions need to made.

Most of the decisions that need to made here in the Hong Kong and Shanghai office are in scenarios that a lot of companies have never experienced before: such as keeping the no title policy in the company IN CHINA. \r\n\r\nWith less experienced candidates, you do get a chance to be the product owner of things, and how you want to proceed with that PO status is completely up to yourself.

Regardless of your title you're expected to provide input and go \"above and beyond\" the basic duties of your job.  There are no \"closed door\" offices in any location I've visited.   The president and CEO have the same size desk as everyone else and sit amongst developers and producers.  They make themselves available to anyone in the company to chat with. \r\n\r\nAlthough many employees have been here \"since the beginning\" I haven't seen any sense of entitlement amongst them; everyone is humble and appreciative that we're growing as a team.\r\n\r\nOutside of my technical duties, I've gotten involved in the community with Riot.  I've had chances to attend conferences and seminars (GDC, E3, local entrepreneurship events), work on a couple internal \"level up\" initiatives, participate in collegiate events, attend hackathons, and work on some PR ideas.

The list of pro is nowhere close to the list of things that can be improved.\r\n\r\n- The culture is great. I know that every company has a mission statement, some closer or less to the reality of things but in Riot we live by our mission statement and we embrace our manifesto. For example one of the value closer to me is \"player experience first\" and \"Take play seriously\". The big majority of us are gamers. This means that not only we love League of Legends and we like play together but also that we feel the pain of our players when something goes wrong.\r\n \r\n- There are plenty of opportunities to grow in so many directions (horizontally, vertically and internationally) and I'm the living example. \r\n\r\n- The senior management is very open, transparent, available and above all \"gamers like us\". They have clear goals, they are so good in communicating them and they continue to improve the way they deliver and work together to define these goals.\r\n\r\n- The organisation is very flat. Very little bureaucracy, processes and approvals. You do what you think is best for our players. Most of the time you do that, sometimes you don't. When you don't you learn and try again.\r\n\r\n- It's the first company where \"HQ\" acknowledged they cannot be the expert in every region because each country is so different from North America. They hires talent and expert in key markets and trusts the local offices to do what's best for the game and players. \r\n\r\n- The company cares about your significant other which makes things so much easier for us as well. My wife for example is not a gamer and she didn't really understand why \"I wanted\" to stay late at work to finish projects for our players (btw, nobody forces you nor nobody makes you feel bad if you leave at 6). Riot organise events for significant others and rioters. She was so astonished about the people she met and the passion we put into League of Legends that she now totally gets it (also we are not divorcing nor in any kind of crisis... we still love each other, and our son, very much)\r\n\r\n- It's true, Riot doesn't mess around.

Start having conversations and make it happen.  \r\n\r\nThere is an open PTO policy and I am constantly encouraged to take more advantage of it.  There is a lot of intellectual desire to be good about work/life balance, but people do get caught up in the presumed importance of what they are doing and forget not to crunch.

There are a lot of things I just love about this company:\r\n\r\na) Riot puts players first. There's not a single meeting I've been in where an argument about player value didn't trump any business argument standing against it. If it's better for the player, Riot will put their money and time where their mouth is and work on it. As a gamer all my life this is a wonderful position to be in.\r\nb) Riot embraces change. Growing from 40 to over 1,000 people doesn't come without it's share of issues to solve. That means if ever practices are put in place that are harmful to Rioters, the players, or the business itself people are ok with owning up to it and changing it. Since change is welcomed it's also more ok to fail, esp. on the art team where finding the \"better\" solution can often take weeks of work.\r\nc) Unlimited vacation days - I'm a hard working individual that loves to invest myself into my work, but if life happens (and it will happen) I love that Riot steps up and helps me take care of it. You need to move? Talk to your team, make sure your work is taken care off, and take time off to move. Or you're struck by sickness? Go home, let it heal, come back and don't get everyone else sick (yay, for not getting people sick).\r\nd) Working from home is ok. Since I have a lot of interaction with other artists I need to be in the office a lot, but in general it's ok to take 1 day out of 2 weeks and work from home. This benefits me and other Rioters greatly as it keeps morale high and allows for some concentrated time working at home as well.\r\ne) Riot cares for us. Very decent health coverage, job stability, annual trips (at least so far), countless programs of all kinds (free lunch Tuesday, sport programs etc.)... there's literally too much to do outside of work that Riot takes care off. It feels great to know that they care enough to make these things happen.\r\nf) Rioters work hard... and I would have it no other way. I don't want to be a pencil pusher that clocks in at 9am and can't wait for 5pm to hit. Rioters work hard, they love to play games and laugh, and they love to create awesome stuff... There's a healthy balance (since we are a live game and can't crunch - at least on the art side) of hard work and going home.\r\ng) There's a lot of different initiatives I started since I've been at this company and the fact that Riot embraces this entrepreneurial spirit is awesome. I get bored to do the same thing over and over again for year after year. I need challenges... and with over 70 million players there are lot of challenges and opportunities. Time and again I've suggested or witnessed sometimes crazy ideas and time and again I've seen  them being embraced. \"Let's try it out\" and \"well, if you want to spin that up, why don't you?\" are common phrases around here... and as long as that's the case I will never get bored around here.\r\n\r\nOverall, I can highly recommend this company.

My favorite part about working here is the autonomy you get.  Other people at the company trust that you know your stuff and won't micromanage or question everything that you do.  You are judged by your results (and people will judge them!).  This trust is a result of an admittedly grueling interview process in most disciplines that tries to ensure that you are player-focused (you'll use your autonomy to make the right thing for the players) and that you are a master of your discipline (you'll use your autonomy to make things the right way).\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of Riot that I love is how open to feedback individuals are and the company as a whole.  Candid feedback is encouraged, solicited, common and responded to.  A recent test of this was when there was a change in payroll that was announced ahead of time, elicited a ton of negative feedback and was promptly cancelled because of the feedback.  Every company I have ever worked for in the past would have not even asked ahead of time, let alone changed their minds.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is just amazing to be surrounded by the quality of people here at Riot.

Your manager controls your salary and your employment is at-will, so sugar coating feedback is a risk.\r\n\r\nNote: poor managers and groups are fewer in number than the good ones.

You don\u2019t join a mold nor a machinery you need to adapt to, you build and craft it with your colleagues. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Big impact projects \u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nEven though the studio is new, we are working on stuff that have pretty big impact and reach over a 100m players. The two bigger projects right now in the Hong Kong studio: we have two teams working on our new platform client (billions of hours are spent in it every month), and one team working on our personalisation efforts (skins). \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Small team size \u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nIt is cool to know everybody in the office. When I visit the LA studio these days, I don\u2019t know most people I run into. Here in HK office, I know everybody, that\u2019s pretty cool. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Multi Cultural office \u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nWe have people from all over the world: US, China, Taiwan, UK, Australia, etc\u2026 we even have two french guys :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Hong Kong as a place to Live - Pros \u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\nThe great thing about living in Hong Kong; convenient and practical city, easy commute, easy travel in Asia, affordable cost of living (food, entertainment, travel), great healthcare, top international schools, great for expats, low taxes, etc\u2026", "cons": "\u2014\u2014\u2014 Still a lot of muscles to build \u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nWhile we are a very strong engineering team, other disciplines are just starting to be built. We only have a couple of artists, still no QA department, etc\u2026 This means heavy reliance on external vendors and a lot of time on recruiting and building teams. If you are a leader who hope to have a team ready for you to execute, this is not your place. Riot will expect you to come and build your team. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 International Recruiting \u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nMost of our recruiting is international (meaning out of Hong Kong). That\u2019s cool for the diversity, but that makes the team building and recruiting efforts more difficult and cumbersome (time zone difference, jet lag, etc\u2026.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Becoming multi studio organisation \u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nWhile some other companies are expert at managing projects from multiple studios, this is really new for us at Riot. We don\u2019t have all the great systems, process, relationships in place yet and our studio is kind of the first to try, especially at that distance. Again, great if you have entrepreneur mindset and like setting things up, but you will be disappointed if you just want to get directions and hit the road running at full speed day one.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Hong Kong as a place to Live - Cons \u2014\u2014\u2014 \r\nNow, the least exciting things about Hong Kong: Some stuff are crazy expensive (real estate, imported goods, international schools), pretty hot and humid most of the year, pollution can be bad (but much more manageable than mainland china)"}, {"review_title": "Great Product - Poor work/life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Aug 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The game is amazing and it's been a pleasure to work on it.

Fast growth and very discerning hiring practices meant a lot of fairly junior existing leaders had to step up to the challenge and take the biggest roles of their careers.  This meant a lot of inexperience leaders in senior roles.

And in many cases they don't have good resources (e.g. mentors) to turn to for help.  This can and does create quite a bit of negative perceptions  on them, their managers etc. More structured training/mentoring/management practices combined with good performance management from the very top and hiring more experienced leaders should be embraced to help overcome this problem.\r\n\r\n2.

It's mostly used in a weaponized way to win arguments.\r\nChallenging convention is not a good idea at Riot, as well as giving negative feedback. You will be labeled as a negative, toxic person, and you won't be having an easy time with your team. The senior leadership, especially, doesn't take negative feedback very well, and is extremely good at dancing around issues and using their political skills. Agree with the leadership (or who's in touch with it), and everything will be alright.\r\n Despite what the so-called \"Riot Manifesto\" says, titles count at Riot, and a lot of senior people leverage them (combined with Alpha behaviors, political games and back stabbing) to win arguments and keep their status. \r\n\"Hungry&Humble\", I've seen many high-level people making fun of other companies and talking about Riot superiority, despite Riot constantly failing at delivering a second game in the last decade.

A lot of company gatherings in which a lot of hyperbolic (unrealistic, in reality), things about the company are said, to an audience wearing Riot clothes.

Although the number of these open spaces is rapidly declining as the company begins to match it's growth curve, leadership does a good job of encouraging individuals to step into opportunities and problem spaces in front of them. In adopting the open PTO policy, Riot decided to put the onus of taking vacations on the employees - which can actually make it tougher to take a longer vacation when you don't see a number associated with your 'earned' days off.

Additionally, the lack of workforce veterans has caused issues with inexperienced management not properly setting expectations, resulting in decreased performance and, at worst, attrition. The last issue is work/life balance. Although the company has established an open PTO policy, frequently many Rioters will spend most of their waking time at work. This creates a sense of missing out for those unable to spend as may hours in the office, and is ultimately unhealthy.

The maturity level of the organization is pretty low, and the campus feels more like a fraternity than a workplace, complete with hazing rituals, a really creepy pressure to have your peers be your main social circle despite having a life outside of work, and sexual harassment galore. For seasoned professionals it's a guaranteed way to take three steps back in your career. I'm all for a chill work space, but there's a difference between understanding that jeans and cuss words don't affect quality of work, and allowing people to get away with playing 35 hours of video games a week at their desks and somehow still claiming to \"add value.\" \n\nThe company mantra \"default to trust\" does not mean people will respect your expertise, it means you're not allowed to be offended when your insight is constantly dismissed and you are relegated to an entry-level workload despite a decade, or more, of experience. \n\nExpect many company mantras to be weaponized in this way, especially if you are a woman. Again with \"default to trust\" -- it means if you are treated unfairly or poorly, it's YOUR responsibility to accept that the offender \"probably didn't mean it\" instead of, I dunno, trusting that the person reporting bad behavior probably has the mental capacity to figure out whether someone \"meant it\" or not?\n\n\"Open feedback culture\" means you can only give constructive criticism that \"feels good.\" You've got to make the other person feel like a hero for accepting and overcoming whatever shortcoming you're addressing. Unless, of course, that feedback is directed at something that is foundational to Riot as a company. There's an imaginary line you cross when you give feedback on the culture itself. Suddenly you are no longer a culture fit -- because Riot can't possibly be fostering toxic behavior. It is never Riot's fault. Ever. If you don't like something Riot is doing, you don't \"get it\" and you are the problem. It's honestly the perfect breeding ground for predators.\n\nThey won't fire you for this, oh no that would not fit the hip narrative pushed by the Brand team. They'll just tuck you in a corner and make your life so miserable you'll decide to leave yourself. Maybe they'll \"strongly suggest\" that you consider whether you are \"aligned\" and that you may be successful elsewhere. \n\nYou can get away with anything if you're charming enough to talk your way out of it. Meritocracy?  More like Mediocrity. There are SO MANY managers with NO experience managing people. Managers whose teams are floundering because they're so inexperienced, they offer nothing in terms of guidance. Managers who openly admit they shouldn't be managing people. And why do these people stay managers? Because they're friends with the right people. Because they talk in circles. Because, honestly, at this point, firing all the useless managers would look really, really bad. I don't think Riot is ignorant that they've let the most incompetent/manipulative people rise up to lead their company -- I think they realize openly admitting it would be a PR nightmare. \n\nAnd what would that do to the organization as a whole? HA, that was a joke. There is no organization. Your team will be reorganized every couple months. Your manager will change frequently. Sometimes your manager won't even know they're your manager. Sometimes you'll get a random dude as a manager \"because he was bored.\" Multiple teams will be made to work on the same project and they won't even realize the other exists. Titles may not have anything to do with anything you're working on. Good luck getting that Director-level marketing job at your dream company when, despite multiple decades of work experience and successful campaigns, your resume is questioned because your Riot years have you listed as a mere \"media specialist\" or some other nonsense. \n\nRiot has some of the most brilliant, passionate minds trapped within its walls. Most of the people are amazing, they're just stuck in a mediocre system that barely keeps itself running.  And they're burnt out from carrying the slack of the duds who don't actually do anything special but SWEAR they are visionaries."}, {"review_title": "Engaging work for a company that cares about its employees", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Aug 2012", "job_title": "Game Designer in Santa Monica, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Riot cares about your happiness as an employee.\r\n-Riot cares about it's players\r\n-Flexible work hours\r\n-Free dinner!\r\n-Everyone is good at what they do here, excellence is expected\r\n-Good compensation\r\n-Makes a great game\r\n-Everyone LOVES games", "cons": "-Riot fires people\r\n-Tad unorganized, have to self motivate and take initiative to get things done\r\n-Long hours are great if you love your job, not so great otherwise\r\n-Need to LOVE games to work here"}, {"review_title": "Living the Dream", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Recruiting Coordinator in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Riot lives up to the Manifesto on its website.\r\n\r\n1.

It's hugely corporate while claiming that it is quite the opposite. It claims transparency while having corporate communications locking down any negativity which could get into the public eye. I've seen the mails where senior staff/leadership are \"Strongly encouraged to get those who will speak positively of the company.\" to post reviews, particularly if negative reviews have been posted so as to discredit them.\r\n\r\nAssuming you are cool enough with the bro-fisting elitism, vicious cliques and frathouse-like environment, you will also most likely be able to ingratiate yourself with those in the leadership and find a way into one of the bizarre 'circles of trust' which many of the leaders here appear to hold dear. Failure is not tolerated in any manner, unless you're favored - in which case you're all good, man.\r\n\r\nDon't expect clear targets/goals or expectations from your manager, that's not cool enough for Rioters, this means you have to hope you're in that circle of trust and use your divining rod to work out if you're on track, but if you're not - Riot is proud of moving people on, so don't expect to have an opportunity to address your issues.

Quickest path to nowhere at Riot on most teams. \r\n- Riot can be pretty clique-y.\r\n- \u201cBusiness Unit Leaders\u201d / departmental heads battle with one another constantly and the CEO is too new and inexperienced to make calls to rectify problems.\r\n- Prepare yourself for lots of politics. \r\n- Finding anything (assets, knowledge, etc...) in the company requires Sherlock Holmes level investigative techniques. \r\n- A group of original people who started at Riot with minimal outside experience have been promoted to director/VP levels - They are pretty much immune to being fired, short of being the subject of an expose by a journalist. They are entrenched. Some of them are bullies. Some of them have no social skills. Some of them are grossly incompetent people who only surround themselves with \"yes\" people. Some of them create or have created highly toxic workplaces. \"good ol boys club\" mentality is still in full swing at Riot, even if they're not sexually harassing people anymore.\r\n- Riot doesn't do a great job at aligning goals from the front lines up to the CEO. There is no OKR type system, so things can get really messy and confusing.\r\n- The \"product\" and \"delivery\" disciplines are in charge of everything, yet they are the most unorganized group at the company. \r\n- HR/Talent is a dysfunctional organization. They are not your friend and they are not invested in YOU as an employee. They are purely there to reduce liability for Riot. They operate in total secrecy. They report to a department leader, not to someone in charge of HR which is an inherent conflict of interest. Don't trust them.\r\n- Culturally, you will be expected to \u201cbe positive\u201d. It reminds me a lot of Theranos or the Fyre festival. (Watch those documentaries, they're good!). This comes at the expense of leaders finding out what\u2019s really wrong with products or teams and doing things about it. Or if they know, they don't care to change. The majority of the time, most concerns or problems have the feeling of being \u201cswept under the rug\u201d. \r\n- If a leader is at fault, problems are usually not addressed without anything short of a public outcry. This often creates a secret toxic environment you should be very aware of. A lot of leaders within Riot want \"Yes\" people, not people who challenge their thinking or raise issues. If you want an example of this, Riot's sexual harassment culture didn't change until a string of Kotaku articles embarrassed leadership publicly enough for them to change things. This is endemic to Riot's senior leadership across so many fronts, its hard to count.\r\n- Steer clear of IPC (IP Creative, formerly known as CDev and IPSD - they've had to re-brand themselves several times.

This company is truly dedicated to the player experience.

Riot's business model is more player friendly, and more sustainable for both company and player. This model is fairly unique and is the real secret to the company's success because it aligns company and player interests.\r\n\r\n[+]  Excellent team \u2013 Riot has done a very good job hiring excellent people.

It\u2019s never \u201cjust a game\u201d to us because we think that entertainment and playfulness are a core human need, coming in right after those other Maslovian essentials like food, shelter, and sexy time. This is a company of people dedicated to serving that need.", "cons": "[-] Weakened culture screening \u2013 as a result of the company\u2019s growth, there\u2019s been some controversial weakening of hiring standards. It\u2019s really hard for example to find core gamers who are also really great at <insert esoteric professional skill>, so the company has had to loosen some of its standards with regards to hiring people who genuinely love games and can be termed core gamers. These hires may assimilate just fine. Or they may go on to hire additional people who don\u2019t game, thus sending us down the long, slippery slope towards becoming another <insert game company full of people who don\u2019t play or care about games >.\r\n\r\n[-] Immature internal infrastructure \u2013 There are about three times as many Rioters today as there were two years ago.

This means that they occasionally micromanage, \u201cswoop-and-poop\u201d and display other behaviors that don\u2019t happen in mature organizations where mid-level management is trusted, aligned, and held accountable.  I\u2019m confident this situation is evolving in the right direction, but it\u2019s currently not where it needs to be.\r\n\r\n[-] Hot, flat, and crowded \u2013 the current offices are increasingly less hospitable to getting work done because we\u2019ve outgrown our current space and are jamming people into an office that was never designed for this sort of seating density.

There are some seriously gifted people here who work very hard, and it's frankly inspiring. The company does a very good job at letting those who seek it tackle greater responsibility. Player focused is not just a mantra; there are often heated debates about what that means, but it's very rare to encounter anyone who is apathetic to player concerns. They are usually shown the door very quickly. The culture has been maintained despite scaling up.\r\n\r\nIn publishing in particular, the team is very strong. We've generally done an excellent job at hiring both experienced people with a passion for knowledge sharing and people just starting their careers but with a high aptitude for learning and execution. Despite the game now approaching 5 years of age, the product still has tons of opportunity for marketers and community managers to re-imagine how we do things and go bigger. The IP is super fun, the game is compelling, and the fans, of which you have unparalleled access to, are the best in gaming.\r\n\r\nThere's other perks: very competitive salary, free dinners, classes, great equipment, playing games at work, but at the end of the day, the best part about working at Riot is that you'll be working with great people and you'll be rewarded if you're willing to take risks.", "cons": "One fact you need to understand should you happen to work in the publishing group and potentially any other group in the company: this is a production driven company. Producers, Product Owners, and Project Managers are the deciders. This in itself is not a con, as it's one of the reasons Riot has been so successful, but like any organizational structure, it presents some issues. Good producers have a great impact, but inept ones are very frustrating to deal with and have a disproportionate amount of power.\r\n\r\nWhen a producer and someone from publishing are able to get along, to understand and listen to each other, and to make decisions together, Riot is unmatched in our ability to deliver product experiences that players love. This is often the case, but unfortunately it's not always. There are two major challenges to working in a production driven environment:\r\n\r\nRelease dates for features are constantly in flux. The added struggle for someone in publishing is that it's not just a \"when it's done\" attitude (which is a good attitude to have), it's that as soon as it's done, producers want to ship immediately. And since the various feature teams don't coordinate their releases, you'll have situations where a period of time will go by with no content, and then all of a sudden you have to make a stack rank of feature promotion and some things will just not get the attention they should. There's rarely a desire for production to ever wait once it's \"ready\", and because of that, players miss out.\r\n\r\nMissed opportunities come from SOME (not the majority) producers, mostly at the associate level, that either don't know the expertise of the publishing group, or don't see the value in marketing or community. Their are a lot of meetings or talks that these producers will set up that at first appear like they are interested in what publishing thinks about a feature, when really they just want to hear themselves talk and have publishing act as \"yes men\". Disagreeing in these meetings will usually be dismissed.\r\n\r\nIf you are coming from a place where you are used to marketing or business development calling the shots, and you liked that sort of environment, this is not the place for you."}, {"review_title": "Best place to learn in gaming", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Product Manager in Santa Monica, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Riot is highly invested in hiring good talent, and helping staff grow.

No egos, just a bunch of people who care about the same things, and want to help Riot create good experiences for gamers.  \r\n\r\nIt is amazing to work with people who care so much about what they do.  It's a great place for someone who is a gamer, or has the DNA of a gamer.  Getting to play games during work is a great plus (though this doesn't mean you should neglect your responsibilities).  Riot also cares about the Rioters who work here, and while the perks aren't overly extravagant in Hong Kong, such as smoothies on Tuesdays and massages on Thursdays, they are nice little reminders that Riot appreciates our hard work.  \r\n\r\nRiot has a very flat structure, which means that once you join, you can be empowered to take on responsibilities and project fairly quickly.  This is great for people who want to hit the ground running.  Your opportunities at Riot are not as limited by hierarchy or bureaucracy, it's really a place where, if you perform, you will be able to take on more responsibilities and leadership roles.  \r\n\r\nThe Hong Kong office is unique in that it is still very much an entrepreneurial atmosphere, but it has the resources to lean back on of the entire Riot.  This is great because we can focus here on doing great things, and not worry about having the resources to get there.  \r\n\r\nOverall, it's been a great experience working here thus far, and while at times the workload has been difficult, I find myself always excited to go to work, to learn from fellow Rioters (and I've learned a lot), to challenge myself with responsibilities I would never get a chance to take on in previous jobs, to duo queue with other Rioters, and for smoothies on Tuesday mornings.", "cons": "The passion and emphasis on culture fit means there's little tolerance for non-gamers and questionable culture fits.

That was my onboarding experience.\r\n\r\nTruth be told I loved it, I was put in a situation where I had to crawl outside my comfort zone and try to figure things out. Riot OCE has gotten better at onboarding since then, there's a multi-day program in an amazing office, games with the team and a new starter BBQ. That said I loved being put in a situation where it was 'here's your desk, go figure it out'.\r\n\r\nOther places I have worked it has always been about here's what you are supposed to be doing, now go do it. Riot has always been about what do you think? What is your take on this? How can we make this better?\r\n\r\nIt was exciting when I started and it hasn't gone away. Everywhere else I have ever worked I go through a couple of months of 'new job honeymoon' where everything is exciting and time flies. Then I start to hit the 3-4 month zone and you usually have your role figured out - after 6 months you have it on lockdown and that's when I wouldn't be really challenging anymore and work starts to get procedural.\r\n\r\nThat never happens here. The things you work on and the role you have with the company grows as you do. If you want to kick down doors and take on more responsibility you will be given the chance to do so. I would caution to say that if you're looking for a place where you can just be a number on a team then it's not going to work out - it's very much a high performance culture.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what's changed from two years ago? I would say that I have grown a lot here. I've never been challenged in a constructive way like I have been here. The team is incredibly smart, driven and united on the purpose of us being here. The mission is not just a corporate slogan on the wall, it's the driving force of every decision we make. It's pretty common to be in a meeting and people collaborate on trying to understand exactly what the best player experience for a particular project means. It can be exhilarating if you are passionate about gaming, if you're not you will find it a challenge.\r\n\r\nI still walk across the Pyrmont bridge going 'wow I get to work at Riot games today'. There's also perks like free food (breakfast on Tues/Thurs, Lunch on Weds), half price gym, free healthcare, great office space, travel, swag, etc, but to me they are icing on the cake. The best review on the perks and the talent (HR) team here is the company will always support you in whatever you are trying to do - you really do get taken care of well.\r\n\r\nBut IMO the best reason to work here is the empowerment and trust. Your manager won't be micromanaging you and telling you how to do your work, you'll help shape the goals for your role and then you will own how to go out there and deliver on them.\r\n\r\nOffice culture here is a big thing too. Everyone knows each other because we are a tight-knit team, it's also very welcoming to new people and so far everyone that has started here has gotten on with everyone really well. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of social events, Riot organised as well as just put together by people at work. It's pretty common for someone organising anything from a trip to the cricket to a board games night or drinks at the pub to email the whole office or walk the floor asking who is up for it. There is no private little groups here like I experienced at other companies. Everyone gets invited to everything basically and whether you go or not is up to you.

They complete projects quickly but spend time at the office primarily to signal to managers that they're \"working hard.\" At Riot that's just not the case. No one cares when you get here and when you leave, as long as your following through on your commitments. Unlimited PTO, WFH as needed and zero micromanaging even for coordinators/associates. You're trusted and expected to figure out how to manage your time effectively; no one is going to tell you what to do and how/when to do it. Results are what matter.\r\n\r\nBeing yourself: I hear this a lot from other Rioters: \u201cRiot is the first workplace where I could really be myself.\" Riot is full of gamers who hid their passion at work before joining Riot; they\u2019re the ex-MtG pros or DOTA streamers who\u2019ve never been able to have a serious conversation with coworkers about their gaming without it being laughed at or belittled. At Riot, we play League and all types of games both at work and after work. We believe that understanding what\u2019s going on in our industry, studying other games and then actually becoming players of them helps us do better work. \r\n\r\nFocus on Talent: Riot is a place where you have frequent conversations with managers and mentors about what you want to be working on, what you\u2019re passionate about, what skills you want to grow in, what you can get better at and how your role helps you get closer to those things. While value to players and to Riot is an important component when deciding what team//projects/products someone works on, Riot takes extra care to make sure people are working on things that they\u2019re excited about whenever they can. Instead of being told what you\u2019re working on and what team you\u2019re joining, you get to be a part of those discussions and push back when things don\u2019t feel right. In the long term, I think this leads to people being happier at Riot and sticking around longer. I myself have worked on 6 different teams in a little under 5 years in 3 distinct roles. I didn't have to leave Riot to grow, explore my other interests and try something new. \r\n\r\nPerks: Riot definitely takes care of Rioters! Health benefits are amazing, there's subsidized lunch daily (and dinner if you\u2019re working late!),  an on-campus cafe for your afternoon latte, endless access to LaCroix, onsite yoga classes and massage services to name a few of my favorites. Seriously couldn\u2019t ask for anything more.", "cons": "Founded in 2006, I very much consider Riot to be in its early adolescence as a company: not quite one of the big game-making machines but definitely not a small indie studio either. With that, there are some big benefits, some of which I mention above: we\u2019re often coming up with processes as we need them instead of following nonsensical, bureaucratic methods the company\u2019s relied on forever. Teams also get the flexibility to pivot on product decisions if we have the data to back it up rather than having to stick to some 5 year plan laid out by executives who don\u2019t really get it. \r\n\r\nThat being said, our leadership teams and internal processes are also in their adolescence and aren\u2019t quite ready to support the making of big, difficult decisions we need to make increasingly often. Calls are sometimes made by someone important without clear reasoning as to why they were made, or decisions are made only after a super long deliberation periods with countless other leaders from around the company. \u201cThe way things get done at Riot\u201d is something to be understood over time, not absorbed by reading a handbook. And even once you understand it after years of observation, the answer is rarely simple or static. The process through which an idea turns into a product is incredibly unclear as is the process through which a team spins down and reallocates Rioters. If you like the structure, clarity and security that larger companies provide, Riot will be a painful place to work."}, {"review_title": "It was Great...

The employees are creative and intelligent, and the overall atmosphere is very pleasant... at least on the surface.\r\n\r\nThe gaming industry's notorious sexism didn't seem to be in effect; female employees were treated with respect and appeared to have ample opportunity for advancement.", "cons": "* Bait and switch employment. When I was first hired, I received a lengthy song and dance about how Riot was different than other game companies. They claimed they respected work-life balance and that, while crunch times did happen, normal employment hours averaged 40-50 hours a week. This was a flat-out lie; 80-100 hour weeks were expected. Long work hours are forgivable; deceiving people about them isn't. \r\n\r\n* Poor work-life balance. Along those lines, a number of the company's smaller \"perks\" disguise their desire to have you live, eat and breathe Riot all the time. They offer subsidized dinners when you work late (which is often), plan vacations and trips to the movies as part of company outings, and otherwise monopolize as much time as possible. If you're young, single and devoted to work, this can be a good fit. If you're in a relationship or like doing anything outside of the office, stay away.\r\n\r\n* Bad management. Management seems to have little idea about how to handle employees, and tactics shift almost day to day. What's expected of you on Monday may be 180 degrees different on Tuesday, then back to the beginning on Wednesday. Meetings take up a huge portion of the work day, with little or no practical impact coming out of them. Some people seem to spend all their time preparing PowerPoint presentations about what they do instead of getting down to the business of doing it. Resources are poorly spent, and an overall lack of leadership pervades. In many cases, managers were perfectly happy to lie about employees under them rather than take responsibility for mistakes they themselves had made.\r\n\r\n* Arrogance, bordering on narcissism. Riot encourages \"go-getters\" and \"leaders,\" which often translates to people who put their own ambitions in front of the greater good. Internecine politicking is rampant, and employees are often tossed under the bus based on agendas that have nothing to do with the company's business or product. There's a lot of back-biting and factionalism... though less in the rank-and-file workers than in middle management and above. Riot tries to bill itself as \"anti-corporate,\" but its overall culture is corporate in the extreme.\r\nFurthermore, a general egotism pervades among all levels of employment. The company seems to feel that a hit game gives them license to treat others with contempt or dismissal, which cuts them off from a lot of potentially beneficial people and ideas. A general fraternity atmosphere occasionally turns into the actively cruel. For instance, a company party was held on St. Patrick's Day 2012, featuring little people dressed up as leprechauns. The \"performers\" hid their faces behind ski masks that clearly weren't a part of their costumes, to save them embarrassment and humiliation. It made for an awkward and unpleasant event, compounded by senior management's seeming obliviousness to the issue. \r\n\r\n*Lack of product diversity. Everyone there loves League of Legends, and obviously the game is doing quite well. But there were no signs of trying to diversify beyond that core product, or do more than expand it as far as it can go. They'll be fine as long as sales remain high, but should the market change, this company doesn't appear to have a contingency plan in place."}, {"review_title": "Growing Pains", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "31 Aug 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Riot is still an amazing company that is growing a lot and will probably grow a lot more.

Almost nobody is there just for the paycheck (and the ones who are just clocking in and out are usually shown the door with generous severance).\r\n\r\nIncredible growth - League of Legends launched with 50 Rioters (people who work at Riot) and today there are over a thousand in 8 offices around the world (more opening with new territory launches each year). This has meant opportunities abound for people able to step up into newer and larger roles. For instance, being in charge of live operations for a game with over 30 million players a month is a lot more responsibility than being in charge of that for a game with less than a million players. The company's been willing to invest heavily in headcount, infrastructure and technology.\r\n\r\nNew Challenges - The challenges the company faces today (coordinating internationally, having hundreds co-develop, supporting millions of simultaneous players) are different from the ones of previous years (launching internationally, having a few elite teams, trying to get people into the game). For me that has meant doing different things than I was hired to, learning new skills and taking on new responsibilities\r\n\r\nAutonomy - Riot tries not to operate hierarchically, and most decisions are made by the teams actually doing the work. There is a crazy amount of empowerment, but also a high level of accountability. Rioters are held to their decision-making track record.\r\n\r\nCross functional teams - Teams of mixed backgrounds (artists, designers, QA, engineers and marketing people) are all put on teams together for projects that require different abilities to succeed, with the idea that teams should be able to own their own destiny and be responsible for their success or failure.\r\n\r\nPlayer-focused - The company truly tries to make the right decisions for the players and for the long run. It's nice to see alignment across the company on building something to last decades and beyond. Riot, for all its growth, is still relatively free of politics and infighting - everyone is trying to serve the players the best they can.", "cons": "Some of the same things that are pros are cons. Allow me to explain.\r\n\r\nPassionate employees - Everyone is motivated and trying hard which creates pressure to put in 100% every day, and at times work longer and harder when your team is at the plate to deliver. That said, the company avoids the typical \"going gold\" crunch by patching every 2 weeks (so there isn't a company-wide \"crunch season\"). There is also unlimited paid time off, a company retreat for everyone and wives/husbands/boyfriends etc (last year to Dominican Republic) and Rioters tend not to take themselves too seriously.\r\n\r\nIncredible growth - Riot has growing pains in its org structure, support systems, IT, office space, etc. It's solving these fast - none of the problems last, and increasingly impressive people join the company to help build these areas out for the future. But Riot is growing quickly from a relatively small company to a mature company, and when some of the support has lagged behind it's been painful. \r\n\r\nNew Challenges - It seems you can never get too comfortable at Riot. There are always new challenges, evolution is the biggest constant. Processes continually get changed and improved, teams constantly have new talent joining, new projects are always getting spun up. For many this is the excitement of Riot, but you have to be willing to keep learning new skills and new ways of accomplishing your goals. If you're looking to sit back and relax, don't apply.\r\n\r\nAutonomy - There aren't a lot of exact steps on how to do your job. Chances are nobody at the company has done exactly what they're asking you to do yet, so you need to make up your own best practices. This can be daunting and there may not be someone there to turn to with a playbook you can execute.\r\n\r\nCross functional teams - There are a lot of people with opinions and expertise in areas who don't think like you do. Figuring out how to get them all headed in the same direction can be tough. You need to be able to work together, be flexible and open minded. Also the bar to get into Riot is high - they are looking for great critical thinkers, gamers and aren't afraid to put you through a long and exhaustive interview process (and may pass despite great credentials if you don't meet their high bar).\r\n\r\nPlayer-focused - Sometimes doing the right thing for players, and walking them through why you're doing it, is much harder.
