With that, the AE gets recognised for the full revenue associated with the new SKU (yes, that is how the HubSpot sales commission plan used to work. It was recently changed in Feb 2020). \r\n\r\nThis does not positively grow the business in the long run, and on the contrary, harms the business which operates on a subscription basis. \r\n\r\nWhen the services team has consolidated the deals closed due to this bad practice, the management turned their cheeks and ask for the team to not \u201cfinger-point\u201d. It makes sense, as such big discounts require the approval of the higher sales management and they were part of the team that made such shady deals possible.\r\n\r\nDue to the \u201cnew revenue\u201d brought in by the said AE, he was promoted in the following month.

You can ask for help with fellow co-workers and even request for some time to do product training. \r\n\r\nBut don't be surprised that as per Point #1, you will be shamed by the management for being transparent about the help you need and they will spin a story telling other employees that you do not know even the bare minimum. Yet somehow, you passed your New Hire Training. \r\n\r\n\r\n7) If the company is done with you and you resign on the same day, they will pay you to leave immediately, treat you like a criminal, humiliate you by saying you are not allowed back in the office to pack their own things, like a Bank's retrenchment.\r\n\r\n\r\n8) For a company that prides themselves on hearing feedback, when an exit interview was requested, it was immediately refused. It required me to go up to the upper management before I was provided one. \r\n\r\n\r\nThese were only the few out of many bad experiences I've had with the company; more specifically, the management here in Singapore. It is fine that the company felt that I was not a good fit, but it was absolutely uncalled for to treat someone with such hostility and humiliation.  It has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth, and also for the current employees to see how I was mistreated. \r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY: My whole time with the company since I returned from their New Hire Training in Boston was handled extremely poorly. Let's just say that for a company who prides themselves on a \"great culture (code)\" and a \"no-jerk\" policy, they did not carry that over from their HQ to their other offices (in this case, Singapore)."}], [{"review_title": "Inbound Growth Specialist (Account Executive)", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Inbound Growth Specialist in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is a review for the Singapore office:\r\n\r\nvalues & work life balance\r\n- transparency of management - one of the most transparent company I've ever worked for\r\n- feedback culture - everyone including MD encouraged to give and receive feedback\r\n- genuinely nice people who work here \r\n- flexibility and unlimited holidays - (however many people abuse this privilege)\r\n- an international hub with people from all countries \r\n\r\ncareer advancement and opportunity\r\n- still a small hub within a big market (Asia + India) so lots of potential and opportunities to learn\r\n- a global company so lots of opportunity for internal mobility", "cons": "- leadership outside of Singapore office is great, Singapore office leadership is lacking, they promote from within and managers lack experience (ie. don't know how to forecast, keep team accountable)\r\n- surrounded by lots of new grads who lack business acumen - lack of talent here to learn from\r\n- global internal processes still need work and causing lots of friction for sales reps to sell\r\n- give out trophies for everything"}, {"review_title": "Best Company To Work For!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Aug 2019", "job_title": "People Operations in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "THE PEOPLE! \r\nYou are almost 100% guaranteed that you'll be working alongside with people who are amazing at what they do. \r\n\r\nTHE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES!\r\nThis is a company that truly cares about the employees and wanting the employees to grow and develop both professionally and personally.

There is no consequence to bad behavior and it is made to seem like we are sensitive and should not finger point, and instead we should be the ones to reflect on our own behavior and not nit-pick.

Many of these reviews say they're unreal but let me break it down a little. It's a 'known fact' that Singapore's national pastime is eating - SingSpot delivers above and beyond on that front. Here's a list of what's in the mix: Waffle Wednesday, Catered Thursday Lunches, (newly-introduced) Panini Friday, End-Of-Month (EOM) Pizza and EOM Drinks. Not forgetting the amazing and well-stocked pantry - coconut water, green tea, ice creams, assorted nut dispensers, regional tidbits and 2 beer taps. \r\n\r\nIf you think we're all about food and drinks, we have got in place an on-site gym and an annual gym subsidy for folks to balance the sinful indulgence. It does seem apt that I mention a little about our focus on Health and Wellness, especially after all that speak about eating and drinking. What we got at SingSpot is an insanely good medical and insurance coverage! It even covers visits at the Chiropractor and TCM specialist. What's more, we've even held massage sessions at SingSpot during our Health and Wellness Week. \r\n\r\nWe are also a rather fun-loving and diverse bunch! Fun fact, we have more than 20 nationalities in the APAC region and that really brings on different perspectives. We also get together frequently as small groups and a couple of times every month and every quarter in big groups. Some cool gigs we've hit up in the past- Virtual Reality Park, LaserTag and Fragment Room. We have various interest groups ranging from the cat-lovers group to school alumni groups and women groups to a ping-pong club. \r\n\r\nIt would be an absolute crime to not mention the unlimited vacation program and the flexibility to work from home. I love how the company recognizes how everyone may be wired differently - working remotely may help one to deliver their best work. To appreciate longer-tenured employees, HubSpot also offers a five-year sabbatical program which is a 4-week paid sabbatical with a $5k bonus! For those who may be interested, we do provide Employee Stock Purchase and Grants along with the employment. I do also think that we're quite competitively compensated at SingSpot. \r\n\r\nI also adore the work-life balance here - leaving work on time means I get to pursue my other passions/interests outside of work which value-adds to my work.\r\n\r\nNow on to the 'more important' perks! HubSpot values personal development and growth of every single employee. The culture of growth and learning is seen in so much that we do - monthly new hire panel, new hire training program, workshops, AMAs, Specialized Training, Company Wiki and our Internal Online Learning Center. The leadership here is extremely transparent - we even have access to the decks/documents from their off-sites. The extremely feedback-centric culture might feel a little uncomfortable at the start but soon enough, you'll look forward to receiving them and eventually delivering some of your own. One of the rare perks I don't see often in other organizations will be my one-on-one weekly sessions with our Managers and Team Leads. These sessions have been truly critical in removing my learning roadblocks and accelerating my growth at HubSpot. The icing on the cake is the free books program and annual tuition reimbursement of $5k available to us to spend on educating ourselves. Overall, I'm just extremely grateful to be in an organization that values our personal growth and development - putting in place all they can to help us become the best versions of ourselves.\r\n \r\nMy last and favourite perk at HubSpot. I can unequivocally say that it's going to be the people I work with. It's one thing to read about a set of values that a company say it will uphold and one thing to see them truly lived out by everyone day in and day out. At HubSpot, it's the latter - I've seen how each and everyone I've come across has lived the \"HEART\" values out and it's such a privilege to come to work some of the smartest, knowledgeable, humble folks I've known. The resolve to solve for our customer is really infectious. It's really inspiring to see people who are trying to become the best versions of themselves and in turn if motivates yourself.  Also, I've never seen a company so happy for people who are leaving the company for further pursuits. Someone once said, \"A good measure of a company is how they treat those who are leaving.\" and I think we rank pretty high in that regard.\r\n\r\nWe have great vision and plans in the coming few years. Although I can't divulge much, I'm really excited about our growth in the coming years. \r\n\r\nI guess this my dream company to work for. So you can say that I'm living my dream now!", "cons": "The following may not be con per se but they're definitely areas of concern for some people:\r\n\r\n- There are really high standards and a really steep learning curve. For some, it might be too metric-driven at times. Therefore, the intensity of the roles might not be for everyone. There's a high chance for burnouts. That said,  the management has tried to improve this with health-related workshops (sleep, posture and nutrition), providing a meditation room, building a safe space and enhancing psychological safety.\r\n- It's an extremely fast-changing environment. SingSpot operates a little like its own startup and it's a bit of a double-edged sword. While we're agile and adaptable, we can get a little disorienting for some. We don't have a lot of policies so typically you'll hear UGJ (Use good judgment) but that can have differing interpretations. Some see this as empowerment, trust and autonomy but some view it as a lack of guidelines. To each his own, I personally love it but a little more processes/systems and playbooks wouldn't harm.\r\n- We're also not as well-known in APAC and in Singapore as compared to HubSpot in other markets. So you might find yourself trying to even spell out \"HubSpot\" for some customers. I personally find that really exciting that we're in the process of making ourselves better known in the region.\r\n\r\nSome other areas for improvement\r\nKPI \r\n- Some of the metrics connected to performance used in this region may not be the most reflective of an employee's ability and can become customer roadblocks. They can be majorly swayed by cultural perceptions of scoring. \r\n\r\nProduct\r\n- While I love the frequent product updates, we can improve the way they're shared.\r\n- Product adaptation to meet regional expansion goals can be enhanced. On the product front, more localisation and more language support are very much welcomed, especially in the APAC region. We're trailing behind in terms of mobile play and eCommerce play. \r\n- The ideas in the HubSpot Ideas Forum can be worked on more actively (especially those with more than 150 upvotes over an extended period of time).\r\n\r\nCareer Development \r\n- Availability of certain roles in other regions may not be available in SingSpot, especially for more product-oriented and niche roles. However, internal mobility is great! \r\n\r\nStrategy \r\n- The playbook for certain markets such as India and some other Southeast Asian markets is still in its early stages and strategies from North America might not be as applicable. \r\n\r\nCross-Collaboration\r\n- Cross collaboration/function can be improved - introduce more projects that require the involvement of 2 different functions\r\n\r\nDiversity, Belonging and Inclusion\r\n- Even though we are rather diverse in nationalities and ethnicity but we can be more conscious in embracing inclusivity and belonging. Comparing SingSpot to other offices, advocacy in LGBTQ isn't as strong. Also, the choice of restaurants and food preferences during social events can take more into consideration of Muslims, Vegetarians and Vegans.  \r\n- Also, we have quite a skewed \"younger\" group of workers  (mostly millennials) and the balance of some more senior workers could be useful for us. \r\n\r\nGiving Back \r\n- We can be more environmentally conscious - more conscious with choice of food vendors and in encouraging the use of own reusable cutlery.\r\n- We can also give back more to the community in Singapore e.g. Blood Donation Drive, Community Events and helping the elderly etc.\r\n\r\nJust a caveat here, no company is perfect and some of these are present in most companies of our nature (SaaS company, mid/large scale and trying to localise). These are simply things I hope we can improve on but I would still like to highlight that it's still one of the best companies I've worked for.

Of course there are limits, but I love that HubSpot treats us like adults and hold us accountable for the output more than the input.

Medical insurance is super comprehensive, and unlike other companies people and managers genuinely encourage you to take your unlimited leave. + the amazing food and events make things all the better \r\n- The people! Most managers (90% from my experience) and directors have 0 airs to them. So willing to talk and help each other out. I came from many other firms where higher ups were more than eager to make everyone else do their dirty work, here management works alongside you and does the work with you. I've had the Senior VP, Managing Director, International - Jeetu memorise virtually everyone's names and he would personally address any of our questions, professional or personal\r\n- Most colleagues are so willing to share and help. There are exceptions naturally, but no one I've met in all my time here is malicious, which in itself is a miracle to me. For context, I am a massive, massive pessimist. I was convinced every firm would be out there to squeeze you dry and you do the same. But the people here in HubSpot have proven to me that your colleagues can truly push you to become a better person.  \r\n- The work is rewarding. I've met real customers who have expressed gratitude that we have helped them grow better as a business \r\n- So much autonomy! Many of my previous companies would tout that they are \"forward looking\" and \"flexible\" but reality was employees were staying till 10pm. HubSpot gives me the autonomy to work from home (even in APAC! which is huge!) and so long as I deliver, there is flexibility.  \r\n- Huge, huge pro to me personally : the facilities.

A lot of tech companies use frills like very attractive perks and benefits (modern designed offices, unlimited vacation, great insurance coverages, parents benefits and many more, we get the drift) and dangle in your face. I think that's besides the point why. \r\n\r\nPeople leave a workplace (no matter how nice everything else is) if they do not feel secure, have a poor manager, or does not believe in the management of the company. \r\n\r\nLet me illustrate how HubSpot has well thought out systems and teams to protect against that disenchantment that attrition is real if none of the above is met. \r\n\r\n1. Feeling secure\r\nThe day that you join HubSpot, regardless of team / role / title, you go through an onboarding program that is world-class. Everyone will learn about the product, and everyone needs to do an intensive project that will put one in a potential customer's shoes - learning how to actually use HubSpot's platform. Having gone through 3 months of onboarding led by the Learning and Development team, you basically are left with very little chance of failing in your role. Learning doesn't stop when onboarding ends. HubSpot really believes in investing in employee development, because if you do a quick search, you'd come to the realisation (as did we) that the cost of hiring a replacement and re-training far outweighs the cost of ensuring that employees are able to adapt and keep themselves upskilled for tomorrow's job. Everytime there is a new significant product change / launch, every customer-facing team (Sales, Services, Support) undergoes training to ensure we know how to talk about it, sell it, and teach customers to use it. Besides internal trainings that are required, HubSpot also believes that when you are upskilled, you also become a more valuable employee to the company. We have a very generous annual tuition grant of S$6750/year for accredited courses, and a discretionary budget for any employee development course, as long as you know that this will help you get ahead in your career. I've since used the budget to take online courses from Harvard Business, Stanford Centre of Professional Development, and other SEO-related courses to enhance my knowledge. We also have our internal Learning Management System called Learn@HubSpot, and these are all FREE to take. There are particularly interesting ones like \"Communicating Effectively With Executives\", \"Why Is Internal Mobility\", \"Working from Home Etiquette\" to job-specific skills like \"Intro to API\", \"Google Ads Advanced Training\" etc. With so many resources available to ensure that you are successful, if anyone complains that they feel they are not progressing, it's really on them to take the initiative to grow, and not just grow, but grow better. I know that all these don't just benefit my role today at HubSpot, but also prepares me for any future endeavours I wish to pursue in the future. If anything, HubSpot allows me to feel like I've stood on the shoulders of giants to accomplish what I have.\r\n\r\n2. Great managers\r\nIt is not possible to have perfect managers at any company. The realistic and pragmatic expectation is how best we manage a poor-performing manager, and ensure that others have the chance to grow and become a great manager. I am an individual contributor, and I have seen my fair share, and worked with amazing managers at HubSpot. These are individuals who care greatly about the success of their team and solve for their team. Everyone at HubSpot lives by the motto of \"Solving for the Customer\", now, our managers live by the motto of \"Solving for the team\". Their main job is to remove any obstacles that prevents individual contributors from performing and excelling, and then let them do their magic. Of course, not all managers are amazing, but there are feedback channels available to surface this to management. It is on the management to ensure that poor managers are trained, and if not, let go, in order to not harm the entire team. I've seen senior managers in very highly visible positions get let go because their performance is just not up to par. It sends a huge message that when the team is not performing, it's usually because the manager isn't managing well, and we are not afraid to make hard decisions when needed.\r\nUsually such decisions are made in the HQ, because these are also the managers who have the greatest impact to either hurt progress, or forge progress. \r\n\r\n3.  Believing in the management of HubSpot\r\nThis is my number one reason aside from the rest why I think working in HubSpot beats going for any MBA program. The executive leadership team is highly transparent. We are talking about 80 pages business strategy memos written by senior leaders that are shared to everyone in the company. There are HELMs (HubSpot Executive Leadership Meetings) and various board meeting decks being shared. Essentially, if anyone who has poor judgement and wants to screw HubSpot over with divulging such information, can. But most don't, and won't. When you are given a lot of information and responsibility to protect HubSpot's future, you tend to act in the best interest of the company. I think this is something that many tech companies say they are transparent, but don't act as they do. All our leaders are also available through Slack, and you can literally just reach out to any senior leaders and ask them anything. I recall having to get some information from our CPO (Chief People Officer) Katie Burke, and she responded to me within a couple hours. I'm based in Singapore, and I have access to our top management in the US, in such proximity. Imagine how powerful that can be in a 2,600 strong company. For the most part, when we say we want to do something, and set it as a company goal, we usually do it, and make bets on it. I've seen how my own role has transformed since the last 1.5 years because of the nature of the development of HubSpot. As we started from a Marketing software company, we have now grown into a platform company. My KPIs have evolved to align with the progress of the business, and everyone is very agile in ensuring that we keep acting and delivering to evolve the company. Our COO strongly believes in HubSpot being big and fast, and I think we are getting there.", "cons": "It's not all a bed of roses at HubSpot. But when you think of any cons and weigh it against the pros, any reasonable and logical person will be grateful and be counting their blessings of just how lucky being a HubSpotter really is. I remind myself to not take things for granted because of petty trivial things that as with time, this too shall pass."}, {"review_title": "An amazing company and software, albeit struggling to make a difference in Asia", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Sept 2019", "job_title": "Service Organization in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is a review of the Singapore branch:\r\n\r\nHubSpot is an excellent company with lots of positive attributes.

It makes it difficult for them to evaluate the resources they need or differentiate between top performers and those requiring improvement.\r\n- In Singapore, the perks granted are often being abused. However, little to no actions are taken by management to enforce more discipline.\r\n- As most staff is below 30 (average age around 27 years old), you rarely feel challenged by more senior co-workers.\r\n- While the Software is great and globally competitive, there is almost no plan to adapt the product roadmap and processes to Asia (SEA/India).

This leads to a situation where leadership can constantly make terrible decisions in planning, team allocation, priority of work etc, while always passing whatever fallout comes from their lack of foresight onto their direct reports. You will run into both senior and director level leadership that essentially has no idea what is going on at the ground level and will not bother to find out. There is an expectation to \"make good decisions\" and \"work well with vague\" requirements. This is great when it works; when the problem is not messy or too hard, and everyone celebrates.

In Hubspot they do not entirely give you your book of business. They let you pick from the accounts that arent in anybody's name and are in your territory (called sourcing).

What this means is that there are people who joined HubSpot years ago, have all the best accounts, then sit on them and wait for them to make an inbound enquiry. New reps are kind of screwed because all that is left for them are the crappy accounts that are tiny/not a good fit. Your book of business will make or break you in sales so if you are hired and the person you are replacing had a bad book of business its not fun. A girl I joined with told me after 5 months that she hadn't needed to do any sourcing since we started as the accounts she \"inherited\" were so good. I was sourcing for 60 mins per day and eventually started to do 4 hours total at the weekend and would often leave one of these sourcing blocks having gone through hundreds of accounts but not found a single really good fit company, just 2 or 3 mediocre ones.\r\n\r\n- Training on the product could be much better.

Most of the initial training consists of the basics of the product but once you start taking queries from customers you could be asked anything, most of which will not have been covered. This results in new reps being lost when more complex support cases arise. This, in turn, leads to undue stress on the reps and a poorer service provided to customers. 1 development day a month is not enough to allow reps to get up to speed with new product updates. Some weeks there would be multiple product updates. Customers would be asking about these despite reps never being given the chance to see what these updates were/how they worked themselves before answering queries regarding them.\r\n\r\n- KPIs/Workload: \r\nThis is related to the above \"con\". As the product becomes increasingly complex, so do the types of support queries that come into the Support Team. The daily targets for support reps have not changed to align with this growth. I know they changed in 2021 but with the increased complexity of queries  this must be looked at again. This resulted in reps working longer than their daily hours to meet their targets, as well as working on cases through team meetings and lunch breaks. This had become the norm and not the exception during my time there, especially with new reps. This will also have an effect on the service provided to customers in the long run and will lead to inevitable burnout of support specialists, which a 1-week break will not, and should not, compensate for.\r\nAs mentioned in the \"Pros\" section, the people are the best part of the company. It's a shame that staff in the support teams are rarely afforded the time to actually get to know the people they work with.\r\n\r\n-Finding information: \r\nThe internal wiki is an absolute mess and it's almost impossible to find the information you're looking for. This leads to the support reps becoming glorified \"googlers\" and just relaying this information to customers. Unsurprisingly, this information is not detailed enough for a lot of customers, who then become dissatisfied. \r\nIf the information cannot be found online, a JIRA has to be opened which will affect your metrics (both personal and team) if too many are opened. \"Taking ownership\" does not work, and is detrimental to the service provided to customers, if the tools are not provided to reps achieve this. \r\nA byproduct of the above is that PEs are dealing with huge amount of queries themselves, often resulting in responses that are difficult for reps to understand or difficult for reps to relay to customers.\r\n\r\n- Organizational issues: \r\nThere are an increasing number of customers that come to support reps expecting something that is not possible with the product. Sales reps are promising things to customers that are not possible, whether this is accidental or done purposefully I do not know. The customer is then pawned off to Support to deal with the disgruntled customer.  While it is certainly not everyone in sales, a number of sales staff have the view of \"It's Support's problem now\"."}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Account Executive in Bogot\u00e1, Bogota", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing culture and benefits, also they really provide good resources for you to do you job", "cons": "you have to live in colombia and cant visit Brazil"}, {"review_title": "Overview", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Product Marketing Manager in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work-life balance, remote work, healthcare benefits", "cons": "Management changes often, teams structure and goals change often"}, {"review_title": "Good but challenging", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Account Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of growth potential but need to be willing to do a lot of prospecting and cold outreach as inbound leads are few and far between", "cons": "Skill development can vary from manager to manager"}, {"review_title": "HubSpot the best company to work at", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Business Developer Representative in Bogota, Cundinamarca", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They invest a lot of time and effort in maintaining a safe place where you can grow and bring full self every day.

We've hired some toxic people recently simply because they had impressive company names on their resume.\r\n* Politics runs rampant: the best ideas don't win anymore and promotions are handed out to the most visible and connected individuals, not the ones who are most qualified.\r\n* The Tech Lead role is a trap. On paper there is upward mobility to Engineering Lead, but the fact is you'll be so overworked that you'll never develop skills and meet the bar for promotion. There is no mentorship available for Tech Leads."}, {"review_title": "6 months in - so far so good!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits and competitive comp.\r\n\r\nBiggest noticeable pro is the culture of autonomy and trust - highly dependent on your team, as with most orgs, but generally a high focus on mental health and work life balance (no koolaid here).

There is no internal growth aside from 'lifers' who have been with HubSpot for over 4 years. The turnover is extremely high with 1/5 of the companies current employees open to new opportunities (majority of these people women and POC). \n\nThey promote people based on personal relationships with leaders instead of qualifications. You have to 'drink the koolaid' and continuously post inflated reviews of the company culture on LinkedIn to even start getting recognition.\n\nCompensation is no where near comparable to other companies in the market. They hire new employees doing the same work as current employees at significantly higher rates (~25-50k above in some cases).\n\nThey have people taking on responsibilities which go far outside of original role responsibilities and refuse to promote or increase comp. This is something I specifically went through, more information below.\n\nFor sourcing specifically, there is a lack of clarity around career growth plans. While management was building this out I was 'kept in the loop' and was given the opportunity to give suggestions and feedback on these plans. However, when the already finalized plans were shared with me, I noticed that it was copied word for word from the recruiting career path. I set up time with my manager to discuss feedback. I had built out a document highlighting similarities and offered suggestions which would be more aligned with the role of a sourcer vs. a recruiter and was told they would take it into consideration. No changes were made. Given I was their most tenured Sourcer on the team and had even been recognized by higher leadership as the reason they decided to build out the sourcing role at HubSpot, I hoped they would be more open to ideas around making this career path reflect the duties and expectations of this role more accurately. This led to many sourcers joining and quickly realizing the role itself was not what they had expected during the interview process. \n\n**Additional Context**\n\nI started at HubSpot as a contract worker on a one month contract which was extended out month by month for about 5 months. Through this time I was the only one out of 7 other sourcers that came and went who, consistently performing above the bar. I frequently expressed interest in being a full time employee and was told every time that it would happen the next month. It never did. I began interviewing and was finally offered a FT position when I brought this offer to leaders. \n\nFollowing this, they hired 4 new FT sourcers which was great given we were able to build out stronger sourcing capacity. When these sourcers joined, I was responsible for training and onboarding them all, getting them set up for success around internal tooling, best practices and metrics. In addition, I had taken on two New Hire Trainings which I gave weekly, if not more, to incoming employees on the recruiting team as a whole. Then we added another sourcer coming from a non recruitment background and was given the task to mentor them 3x a week on top of general onboarding and training. I had no problem with these tasks as I am always open to help our team grow and continued to maintain above average metrics. \n\nMy issue comes in when I attempted to have growth conversations with my manager. I felt as though I was taking on the responsibilities of a sourcing team lead. I was told we could discuss promotions but then was met with my manager continuously canceling our 1:1s and shortening them to 15 minutes. I gave my manager feedback on this and while I know she was busy with many new new hires, I think this is unacceptable behavior from a direct manager. \n\nI finally decided to cut my losses with HubSpot.

(It doesn't mean the work-life balance is great - most of new hires have to work work as late as 10 pm or later and senior colleagues even won't help you much - I feel sorry they just keep asking what you have tried and you'll often have to keep repeating the explanation)", "cons": "ABOUT THE COMPANY\r\n- Even though the management says that the company cares about diversity & inclusion, it only covers the job application process. I know several colleagues who suffer or have suffered from health problems/disorders due to overwork, and they had to leave (or they had to decide\u00a0to do so) as they couldn\u2019t keep up with the high expectations. I understand this happens at other companies too, but it is so disappointing considering what they claim they are.\u00a0\r\n\r\nABOUT POSITION'S KPIs\r\nAgain, even though the company \"cares\" about diversity, all of the support reps are expected to excel at everything - dealing efficiently\u00a0with all tickets, soothing unhappy customers and generating sales.\r\nI believe support reps' KPIs are unfair.\r\n- They use NPS as the customer satisfaction survey, which results in a lose-lose situation.\u00a0\r\nThe score is usually used to measure loyalty towards the brand, so customers often send lower scores because they are frustrated about the product or situation (account suspension, feature request etc.) and customers' moods affect the score a lot. Also, customers don't know the standards of the score. (Most customers may not think that a 5-8 out of 10 scores would hurt reps' individual performance score. And we're not allowed to explain how it works in HubSpot.) I believe there should be better and more specific questions to measure individual performance than \"On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend to a friend?\".Needless to say, it affects customers as well. Some reps never take angry web tickets or account suspension and it is understandable: who can be happy about an account suspension and the lack of desired functionalities? So it\u2019s almost guaranteed that they\u2019re going to get a negative or passive score for the ticket, no matter how much effort they make.\r\n- Replying to existing tickets is not counted towards workload / units of work. Also, units of work of live chat tickets are counted as almost half that of other tickets' from other channels - even when you deal with a 2-hour chat. Some customers ask \"Oh wait, I'd like you to check another thing\" several times in one ticket, just like tickets from phone/call-back tickets. Also, you have to deal with 2 or 3 chats simultaneously and you have even more pressure, as many customers expect reps to write something every 3-5 mins.\r\n- They have a KPI for upselling/cross-selling, but you would not get a penny for the closed deals, unless you won the global content (that is affected a lot by the performance of sales reps.)\r\n\r\nABOUT THE TEAM\r\n- Getting a bad score on NPS after making a lot of effort is already heart-breaking. Not sure why they have to expose negative comments on the looker dashboard that everyone sees every day.\u00a0\r\n- They don't localize KPIs. Customers from some areas have a higher tendency towards a greater number of replies and additional questions. Also, if you deal with non-English tickets, it'll take a lot more time for reps to gather English information to research docs and file internal tickets in English and to translate information for the customers, but the minimum daily/monthly quota of the units of work is the same as for English-speaking rep's.\r\n\r\n- \u200bWhile I was there, I didn't feel supported by the manager. They start to say \"use good judgement\" within the month you join and you bear full responsibility if anything bad happens. We (especially new hires) make decisions which\u00a0is\u00a0to ask the team leaders or other colleagues before getting back to the customers because we don't have enough experience or knowledge to make decisions by ourselves yet.\u00a0If something bad (e.g. negative NPS happens) happens, you'll be blamed for \"poor judgement\". In my opinion, \"use good judgement\" shouldn't be an excuse for managers not to set rules or not to be responsible for their teams"}, {"review_title": "Fantastic place to learn and grow", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "13 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Engineering Lead in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Amazing work life balance\r\n- Lots of career growth and promotion opportunities\r\n- Strong comp package\r\n- Autonomy to succeed at all levels", "cons": "When I started here a few years club, it was definitely a bit of an insider's club (hard to break in), though that's really gone down lately"}, {"review_title": "Great culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture and Diversity programs", "cons": "Make sure you go for the role that fits your skill set"}], [{"review_title": "Best place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Title says it all.

I have never been more gaslit in my entire career, months after quitting I realized \"complaints\" people were making about me to my manager were in fact very likely fake and used as a mechanism for fear. I was told for months I would get fired, put on performance plan, etc and when I asked for the plan in writing, I was told my metrics were actually not poor enough to be put on plan. It was all fear mongering and gaslighting. \n\nHubspot will come across as \"woke\", but it couldn't be further from the truth.

HubSpot will also pretend to care about mental health and unplugging - the only time I was told to take time off was to \"consider medical leave if I wasn't going to hit quota.\" \n\nIf you're reading this and thinking about quitting HubSpot, do it. Most of the people I started with quit within a year (once a fat chunk of their stock vested), and we've all come out the other side and commiserate often on how brainwashed we were to think HubSpot was the golden goose of tech, when nothing could be further from the truth."}, {"review_title": "A few years down, many to go!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Marketing Manager in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I joined HubSpot right out of college, and am consistently reminded why I've stayed.

Unlimited Paid Time Off is a perk that workers actually use, with the exception of Sales, really. The flexibility to work remotely is wonderful and modernizing with the times.

When I started working towards management, my VP even provided me with monthly mentorship & guideance when I asked - this isn't something you'd have access too at every company.\r\n\r\nI've been given the space to try new things, sometimes it went well, sometimes I failed. I think the important piece here is that I was given the space to fail & learn from it, but I was supported in recovering from those failures. \r\n\r\nHubSpots focus & commitment to DI&B has meant I've worked with people from all sorts of backgrounds - this has been such a valuable experience as it's really forced me to challenge my view of the world and look at things from other peoples perspectives.

Internal mobility is easy (albeit very competitive) too. I'm told salaries are slightly lower than elsewhere but bar the really big tech companies I haven't heard much examples of that. \r\n- Resources: You're given the resources to do your job, whether it's tools or the training to tackle problems. It's also very rare that too much is asked of you directly anyway. \r\n-Benefits: Pension scheme is decent (match your contribution), there's funds available to pay for education courses if you ask, the share scheme has been great given the company growth, health and dental insurance are very welcome, unlimited holidays means I never worry about stretching over my days (I take about 30 a year with no pushback at all).\r\n- Remote vs office: have always been allowed wfh the odd day, but now full remote is an option, or full office or a hybrid. You just need to pick one. Knowing I could move (even country) is great.\r\n\r\nOverall, working here has allowed me to really grow my career. I had no experience in tech before, but came through the support team which thought me a lot about HubSpot and the tech landscape, and was able to move on for a new role and skills (like many others from support). I've personally experienced a huge increase in salary too, and the shares have added to that and given me sums of money for a deposit that I thought impossible before.

Hanging out with colleagues after work for drinks, or during for table tennis was a great way for work to feel more social and less of a grind. For some, remote work will be worth it but for me the office was a big plus. Remote work has been handled as well as it can be though, better than my of my friends or family in other companies report. \r\n\r\n- Challenging: whilst you're given everything to succeed there is a steep learning curve. The software is huge now, and if you haven't worked with this sort of online software before there's a lot of general tech info to catch up on too. You'll be given everything you need and so many people have skilled up in the process (incl me), but it's draining learning so much at times.\r\n\r\n- Work/life balance: Usually really good, managers and colleagues will stop you working too much. It's 100% not expected to work past 5pm (Dublin). They just gave the whole company a week off, too! \r\nHowever it doesn't always work that way when things are busy for you, and during lockdown in particular I think that has slipped more as we're not in the office to support each other on it.
