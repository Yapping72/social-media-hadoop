If you are happy with your current skill set and do not want to work too hard to change or learn new things, you can find a comfortable cubicle at Lockheed.\r\n\r\nI've talked with others who had worked for other large corporations before working at Lockheed, and they all agree that Lockheed is better. So as far as large corporations go in general, Lockheed is not bad. Much of what I have to say about the downsides probably applies generally to this type of corporation in the context of being a software engineer.", "cons": "In a nutshell: this company is not recommended to software developers who are driven, passionate, curious, and who take their craft seriously. The workforce consists of soulless clock-punching factory workers marching to the slow beat of a gigantic, impenetrable bureaucracy under the iron fist of stifling, heavyweight processes. The mental atrophy that I was exposed to during the long hours of the day at Lockheed was steadily taking its toll on me. Had I stayed there long enough, I would have become more and more apathetic and docile until my passion for software development finally died.\r\n\r\nIf you are a software developer and you have a job offer from Lockheed Martin, I strongly urge you to consider what kind of a developer you are and what kind of an environment you're comfortable in. If you take pride in your work and in doing things the right way, or if you are driven to learn new things, think twice before accepting that offer. If you actually enjoy coding and you do it for free in your spare time, you will find yourself alone at Lockheed. If you like to have a choice in the tools, languages, frameworks, or platforms that you use to do your work, or if you even have any strong opinion whatsoever about these things, do not sign that offer letter.\r\n\r\nOne of the most disappointing things about my time at Lockheed was the fact that there was no one I could look up to as a software developer. Until that time I had always had people to look up to; people who were better than me and repeatedly proved it. It's important to have that, because then you have an incentive to push yourself and a vision of what you can be. I sorely missed that at Lockheed, and I'm glad to say that I've since found an environment where I can learn from others who are better than me.\r\n\r\nThere is a cult of seniority; a trite ranking of levels that have little to do with how good you are and everything to do with how long you've been there, at least for the first few levels. After that, the usual political maneuvering applies.\r\n\r\nThe performance review process starts out with you copying and pasting the \"personal objectives\" that were given to you by management into an internal web application form. Some months later you go back to the web application and fill out how you fulfilled your personal objectives. These personal objectives consist of phrases like \"I synthesized the strategic vision and leveraged internal and external synergies.\" You then get called into your boss's office and he gives you the standard middle-of-the-road approval that he has to in order to balance the quotas in the appropriate spreadsheet for his boss. \r\n\r\nProcess and paperwork take up the majority of activity each day. Stifling quality control is what makes the wheels go round at Lockheed. It's a business focused on integration, not innovation. Plenty of lip service is given to innovation in motivational posters, slogans, recruiting paraphernalia, silly top-down initiatives and the like, but very little of it actually happens. In order to innovate at Lockheed, you have to break rules and make enemies. You have to go under the radar or you cannot accomplish any change. There are many people at Lockheed who have been doing the same thing for years and they will fight you. Even software engineers end up with the job of making sure that the appropriate hoops have been jumped through, all the forms have been filled out, and everything has been approved in triplicate. For all the process and ritual that we had to perform as software engineers, we skipped the important ones like unit testing and continuous integration. \r\n\r\nAs a software engineer, you have no choice in the environment or tools that you use to perform your craft. You get a standard Dell laptop (if you're lucky) with Windows that is fully locked down. In order to install anything, you need to fill out a large form and get approval from around ten different people you've never heard of. This will take a couple of weeks at least. If by that time you need a new version of the software, you will need to submit a form again. You are not allowed to download anything from the Internet without permission. Your computer is controlled by the IT department and they will control it remotely whenever they feel like it. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft Office is used for every piece of information. Outlook is where all the information flow is. You spend a lot of time searching through your Outlook inbox to find that something that you recall somebody sending you at some point. Information about the project your working on can only be found in unsearchable PowerPoint, Excel, and Word documents hidden in an obscure shared directory. Some information is hidden behind the most hideous and time wasting in-house web applications you've ever laid eyes on. Many of them only work with Microsoft Internet Explorer 6."}, {"review_title": "An okay place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work is of some meaningful value.

My experience and perspectives I can share about Lockheed comes from a large sample size of many individuals who have had over 30 years of experience to where you could easily say they know too much about the company and what goes on behind closed doors. So yes, this is going to be a pretty detailed review. Your experience at Lockheed will vary greatly depending on your manager, team, and program. Unfortunately, the program I worked in had nothing good you could say about it except that some of your colleagues may also share the same concerns as you. One of the funniest things someone said to me to get me to stay was that \u201cyou do get paid on time\u201d as if being paid on time was a perk no other Fortune 500 company could offer. If you want my TL; DR advice: know what you want\u2026 Get out ASAP if you are looking for a place where you have an opportunity to change the world, develop technical expertise, and most importantly get paid what you are worth.", "cons": "TL; DR \u2013 If you google \u201cTen Signs Your Company Couldn\u2019t Care Less About You \u2013 Business Insider\u201d Lockheed easily hits all of those points without any effort.\r\n\r\nBackstory: I was on one of the programs which ended up moving from CA to CO. A good decision for current board of directors to save costs, up returns for shareholders, and increase their annual bonuses but bad for you, the employee esp. if you just graduated college and want to be where things are happening in Silicon Valley with all the other young professionals (more opportunities). Since they announced the move back in 2017, every week, we literally had 1-5 employees either retire or grabbed by a Tech company in Silicon which paid 2x-3x more. We also had a bunch of managers stolen by Tech (my manager included) as well which clearly shows the power of money and the ability to buy out talent which pretty much left Space Systems with average performers in general. Upper leadership straight up lied to the employees saying they will potentially get to have a new building in Sunnyvale as they placed a model of a brand new building in one of the lobbies. Fact check: that was from a Google acquisition and that building will be for Google employees.\r\n\r\nThere is a LOT of politics as you would expect and it\u2019s a big reason why people leave\u2026 I knew a previous manager who was fired for not following company polices so to combat that the directors had to hire someone from the club who they could trust to 100% follow orders and company policies (you have to sell your soul to the company to become a manager+). If he were to break any policies, he would have probably been disciplined or kicked out of the club and would not be able to ascend to the director level. But this completely sets the program up for failure moving forward because now you have new leadership based on buddy-buddy politics. In addition, new management is forced to follow a rigid set of rules which, according to many successful managers and CEOs I know, is a bad way to manage people because it assumes a one-size-fits-all or one-rule-fits-all for every situation. But contradicting that, managers still have favorites where exceptions are made.\r\n\r\nTake this for instance, there were a lot of times a colleague of mine was constantly bullied by a senior but less experienced engineer (they bumped up less senior engineers to more senior as they could not find anyone externally to fill the talent gap or anyone who wanted to do administrative engineering) for not being able to complete tasks which he never even got briefed on. Instead of the senior engineer owning up to lack of guidance and leadership skills, my colleague had to own up to it. I\u2019m almost certain he left the company or is in the process of leaving.\r\n\r\nAnother colleague of mine who was on the same program requested things such as WFH as he was the only one living a couple of hours away from work. Instead of empathizing, leadership labeled him as the \u201centitled millennial\u201d which is interesting because the guy was one of the few people left in the program who actually got things done. Also, the definition of millennials goes back to about anyone born from 1981 to 1996 such that \u2013 ironically \u2013 most of the new leadership themselves are in fact millennials. I\u2019m pretty sure the guy is no longer there and got picked up by a Tech company, what a shame.\r\n\r\nI knew an engineer in a more senior role who I seriously believed was on a track to be a manager or a director. Unfortunately they made him \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t even believe this \u2013 literally sort papers in a 1940s shed (totally fiscally responsible to charge the government $300+/hr/engineer to file papers instead of hiring someone to sort and package them for $10/hr right?). Needless to say, he said that it was his first job at Lockheed and certainly his last.\r\n\r\nSome more red flags: \r\n\r\n1)\tProgram was awarded a 420M contract in 2017, in 2018 directors did not know how to utilize that money to get things sorted out and relocated from CA to CO.\r\n2)\tInexperience flows down from the top as I said, the whole buddy-buddy politics caused this to happen and now you have a bunch of unqualified people in a senior role.\r\n3)\tFacility/infrastructure was so degraded that it\u2019s questionable if it has ever been OSHA certified in the past decade. There were times were the smell would be extraordinary, or times we had no water to drink or no A/C and pipes broke due to lack of maintenance (one manager quit because a pipe burst on him, it was the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve seen)\u2026 Seriously, hope I didn\u2019t get cancer from anything\u2026 It was much easier to see the world of difference between Defense and Tech in Silicon Valley by walking across the street and grabbing lunch on the Google campus. That was a wake-up call. And yes, if you are wondering, Google does have water, A/C, and electricity.\r\n4)\tIn 2018 they rolled out what they called Destination Wellbeing which announced higher deductible plans or something along the lines of \u201cthe company will no longer cover you for x, y, and z anymore, that\u2019s on you\u201d. This roll out got so much bad press that people were calling it \u201cDestination Bankruptcy\u201d and one of the SVPs had to step in, delete comments, and shut down their internal blog post (I mean\u2026 What else did they think was going to happen? Shows how out of touch the board members are with the rest of the company). Several of weeks later they literally had some SVP guy give a blog post about how great it is to be underpaid and have no benefits. It was something you certainly had to see to believe!\r\n5)\tLockheed\u2019s inability to retain talent, effective leaders, and move quickly (actual design and development at Lockheed happens about once every 40 years...) causes competitors like SpaceX and Blue Origins to offer the government a better service at a lower price point while grabbing a bigger piece of the pie which was once Lockheed\u2019s. What once was thought a stable company might not be stable several decades from now if this trend continues. There are some exceptions like the FBM program but as I said before, if you are a new grad, do you really want to work at a place that does not challenge you and you have to live with a product which was designed to basically (hopefully) never ever be used for the rest of your career?\r\n6)\tTo add to my previous bullet regarding productivity, there were many times when we would have 8+ person meetings were we charge the government $300+/hr/engineer just to debate how many columns an Excel Spreadsheet should have or how many slides a PowerPoint should have. Next thing you know the joke at the weekly staff meetings would be \u201chow many Lockheed employees does it take to screw in a lightbulb and what\u2019s the cost to the taxpayer per hour?\u201d\r\n7)\tPay back in Silicon Valley was about 50% of what other engineers were being paid at Tech companies. If that doesn\u2019t sound degrading to you I\u2019m not sure what does. Lockheed only seems to be able to retain people who a) do not know their true market value b) are so blindly passionate about aerospace such that they are taken advantage of by upper leadership."}, {"review_title": "Subcontract Administrator", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jan 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Flexible work schedule \r\n- Great people to work with \r\n- Assigned challenging tasks that helped me gain experience\r\n- Several worldwide office locations, potential opportunities to travel", "cons": "- Strict budgets, no office perks such as free snacks or coffee\r\n- Hierarchical management system, inconsistent promoting process\r\n- Worked on several Government contracts, meaning large amounts of paperwork and extensive amounts of approvals - Can often delay progress and lead to setbacks"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Multi Functional Manufacturing Supervisor in Fort Worth, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay, good vacation and personal time policy, flexible schedule, great leaders, plenty of career advancement opportunities", "cons": "The company recently transitioned to a high deductible healthcare plan for salaried employees.

The senior leadership position in Operations was filled with management from the northern facility, with no experience in Corporate Aircraft Production/Completions.  Absolutely zero time by this position is spent on the floor with middle management and technicians to ensure a positive team atmosphere.  Nepotism from Operations Senior Leadership has invoked fear and confusion by bringing in former friends from previous leadership roles within the business located outside of Coatesville.  Operations Senior Leadership conducts business by intimidation, screaming and yelling in meetings, and expectations are not at all understood due to lack of knowledge within this position.  The senior leadership in Operations has incurred severe ethics violations which have been egregious violations completely ignored by the H.R. group as well as the B.P.O office due to the impending layoffs known by senior management in September of 2015.  The H.R. group is not at all engaged with the employees, and their focus is to ensure Senior Management as well as the company are protected, at the cost of the employees.  The recent layoff in September of 2015 was carried out in extremely poor fashion, and some of the most experienced managers and technicians were let go without regard to seniority or performance feedback scores.  Nepotism was clearly evident with the recent layoff in September of 2015, as several of the \"new\" managers that were brought in by the Operations Senior leadership, with less than one year of tenure, were kept, and managers as well as employees that were laid off had experience levels that far surpassed any experience by those retained.  Communication by Operations Senior Leadership is extremely poor, and the \"silo mentality\" is clearly evident. The recent layoff in September of 2015 was conducted in poor fashion, and over 200 highly experienced managers and technicians were laid off.  Severance packages were given with specific details expressing that re-hire would invoke forfeiture of severance awarded, yet minority employees were re-hired without re-payment of severance.  The S-92 and S-76D production have dwindled to less than 1/4 of the normal production of previous years, and the Light Helicopter Program is an abomination which was completely ignored by Operations Senior Leadership, and the existing manager, an employee with high accolades and experience, was subsequently laid off due to the lack of attention by Operations Senior Leadership.  Managers with many years of military and corporate production experience were laid off with no regard to their tenure or performance evaluation scores, and their positions have been filled with the remaining non-experienced employees with no experience in production aircraft builds.  The recent layoff was blamed on oil price reduction reported by senior leadership, yet the new S-76D aircraft deliverables were extremely late, with customers backing out of contract due to production dates being pushed out by Operations Senior Leadership's inability to manage the process. The business is a revolving door, and loss of employees by attrition is abundant.  Current employees are looking for gainful employment elsewhere since the recent layoff, and communication by senior leadership is non-existent.  The recent layoff in September of 2015 has affected some of the most highly experienced employees in a negative way.  The families of these employees have been adversely affected, and the careers of some of the most experienced employees in aviation have been ruined due to the lack of leadership and insight by HR and Operations Senior Leadership.  Middle Management has had to fend for themselves, and constant criticism by Operations Senior management is the norm.  Senior Leadership within the Quality group is atrocious.  A once powerful team of some of the best in aviation have been brought to their knees due to the mentality of the current senior leadership.  This is not a company that is recommended for a future career in aviation anymore.  It has been ruined by those that cannot seem to understand that the customer comes first, and the employees on the floor are the most valuable asset.  The HR team is pathetic, and the BPO office is an abomination.

This is a well-oiled script amongst LM employees that primarily consists of \"anonymous\" reports to Ethics, various Vice Presidents, and the CEO. The allegations don't have to be true. Since LM is absolutely opposed to even the potential appearance of impropriety, an employee can experience serious consequences for the potential and appearance of improper behavior (it doesn't have to have actually occurred) and/or the behavior of people they associate with even if they never engaged in the behavior or endorsed it. This applies anywhere and anytime regardless of whether employees are at work, at a public place before/after work, or at home. The consequences for perceived, potential and real offenses are recommended by Ethics and Human Resources but ultimately determined by the employee's leader regardless of what the leader says when they dole them out. The use of ethics to harass others, along with other behaviors that were just as disturbing and controlling, made it a priority to pursue a significantly different work environment. I do not want to administer Human Resources in a place where humans spend a significant amount of time harassing each other under socially acceptable systems such as ethics and employee relations, and believe it is normal.

There were a number of people just like me, just wandering around the halls, hanging out in the labs with nothing to do. To make matters worse, they would still hire more people into the program to fill vacant positions, which makes no sense.\r\n\r\n2) When I did have work, it usually involved trivial things like updating documentation, updating some records in a database, etc. At first I thought this was just overhead for some bigger project that the team I was on was working on. As it turned out, my whole team's job was to simple manage some word documents and keep them updated, and do other vary trivial tasks. This was all, like a slap in the face to me coming from a computer science background and having actually solved real world problems. The worst part is that most of the people on my team carried the title of \"Software Engineer\". In fact, my manager's title was \"Senior Software Engineering Mngr\", but I doubt they knew anything about software (Other than using Microsoft Office).\r\n\r\n3) There is subtle slogan around the company \"Selling yesterday's technologies at tomorrow prices\". That is so right, and accurately describes Lockheed (at least IS&GS).\r\n\r\n4) Since I started, people have been leaving the company on a regular basis. Most of the new hires that I started with lasted a few months and then quit, mainly for the same reasons listed above.\r\n\r\n5) The most useful skill that I was able to apply to my job in my time here was my Microsoft Office skills.

After a year or two, you'll find out that those people weren't joking. While Lockheed can shower responsibilities and experience on young employees, all promotions are based on years of experience and all raises are based on sucking up to management. This is the sort of company where you could single-handedly win a $25 million contract and be turned down for a promotion because you are 1 month of experience short of the requirement. By the way, that's not hypothetical. In my time at Lockheed, I've seen situations just like that play out... twice!\r\n\r\nLockheed is a silo'd company, so it really feels like a loose alliance of hundreds of small-medium companies. It's sort of an interesting place to work, until you realize that all parts of Lockheed fiercely compete with each other. We operate like a pack of wild animals, constantly fighting each other for food, but remaining together for survival. This creates a toxic, ultra-competitive environment where people are rewarded for betraying the guy down the hall because he's from a different part of the company. I've seen people get their yearly raise reduced for helping other parts of the company win new business.\r\n\r\nThe last important thing to know is that they've been making small benefit and quality-of-life cuts every few months for the last ~3 years. They're usually small, but they keep happening like clockwork and they're adding up. I've had multiple raises and a promotion and my total compensation is the same as when I started.

I have serious doubts about our future ability to meet our future requirements given the steady decline in the talent pool over the last few years.\r\n\r\nManagement only values \"leadership\" traits in evaluating employees.  If you don't aspire to be a non-technical manager yourself, you have no chance of being evaluated as anything better than middle of the pack.  That means you will get a paltry annual raise that doesn't even keep up with inflation, let alone industry salary growth.  It also means that no matter how good you are, you can't be promoted without at least pretending to want to do management-type activities.  If you aren't good at what management values, no amount of logic and reason will convince them that you are a good employee.  The performance appraisal system is sufficiently vague and nebulous that any manager can give any employee any assessment and find an excuse to justify it.  \r\n\r\nSenior management is severely disconnected from reality.

Salaried employees are treated like hourly employees. Hours are counted to the minute, and overtime is expected to be copious regardless of its actual need. During yearly reviews you will be scalded if you haven't \"donated\" time to the company in the form of uncompensated overtime. Even if an outstanding job was done, managers will ding you on not \"donating\" enough overtime. This essentially lowers you hourly rate, making us all hourly employees. Salaried!? You have got to be kidding me. If I finish tasks for the day I'm expected to sit at my desk and look at the clock. \n \nBenefits leave little to be desired. I pay $400 a month for family benefits. That's $2400 a year more than my last government contracting job! They make the employee pay for all kinds of services they will never use. They basically run their own health insurance company, and it is done poorly. The 401k is garbage. Really means a lot to me that the company is contributing a whole 4% to my retirement, they call the salaried savings plan. This contribution is laughable, and will not be a variable when I consider leaving. further, they try to make you think  they care by giving you 1% off the top the first year. Then another 1% in year two, and another in year three with the capital accumulation plan (CAP). This plan is negligible at best for someone like me who can't get out the door fast enough. \n\nMy time is money, time with my family and extremely important to me. This company (SSC) is not family friendly. If you are starting a new family as I am, do your family a favor and pass on this company. Job satisfaction is the lowest I have ever experienced. The people I work with have been with the company 25 years +. They are all on the hook to keep their pension. So, they can't leave to improve their personal capital without losing a % of their pension. They have worked so long to get to this point they will do just about anything the company asks to keep it. They are disgruntled. This leads to poor job performance, resulting in late projects. For example GOES-R is over a year late for launch. Management doesn't care because they are in the same position. Also, it doesn't appear from my low vantage point in the organization that management is held accountable for anything. Most managers have been promoted to their personal level of incompetence. I plan on getting away from this place as fast as I can.   \n\nOh. One more thing. Lower the dang price of food in the cafeteria. Stop trying to get your money back by charging an arm and a leg for food. Reminds me of a casino getting your winnings. That leads me to the lack of places to go to lunch.

You WILL wade through several layers of documentation and authority to complete any task, and you WILL encounter resistance when trying to streamline operations. Don't expect to be creative in your job, either - as a result of the fore-mentioned paperwork, this company runs on legacy systems and knowledge and hardly tolerates change.\r\n\r\nExpect a lot of classically apathetic employees who are 50+ years old going through the motions of their work, and a smaller number of people who are < 30 doing the same thing (they tend to go elsewhere after a couple of years, and with good reason). The exceptions to these demographics are a rapidly ascending small group of middle managers to fill the gap, and possibly the most unnerving group of young corporate climbers in the technical leadership programs. (Anecdotally, most participants are from lower tier schools - but to be fair, they're simply indicative of the value placed on interpersonal skills that fit the company culture over raw technical ability. That's well within the corporation's prerogative, and it's obviously a mutually beneficial relationship.) The young corporate climbers might not be unique to the company; but be sure you can buy into its culture before joining LM.\r\n\r\nI'm modifying my original statement. If you're young and energetic, LM might be the place for you, because with those qualities it should be easy to stand out. This is doubly true if you're a minority - you will see no one will looks like you in executive leadership (even more on the downside, you might get a lot of the old guard commenting on your \"diversity\" status; this has actually happened to me on several occasions). If your priorities lie more in line with doing actual engineering work, being able to concentrate on doing it well with other talented folks and being surrounded by people who feel the same way, go someplace else.

To add insult to my injury, I was made aware of the sad fact that we have been stripped of our legal right to sue for work place injuries in this state. I have no recourse against my employers\u2019 negligence and they have no real incentive to provide a safe workplace in the first place! \r\n\r\nThe Workman's compensation system handles all work-related injuries. The employer picks the doctors, or rather give you the \"choice\" of their two picks. You cannot see your own doctor, for fear your normal insurance provider won't pay. The unemployment doctors want employers to send them business, so guess who they work for? They are very skilled at setting up constant road blocks to treatment, let alone actual diagnosis and they're not afraid to shame you and even verbally abuse you while you are sick and standing before them. They actually let the insurance providers \"case worker\" sit in on clinic and specialists visits and guide the treatment! They have no shame.\r\n\r\nIf you are eventually diagnosed with a permanent injury. Compensation payments are capped, \"very low\" by a schedule of different types of injuries. An eye is worth so much, a finger this much, etcetera, and then they pro-rate by the percentage of total use that was lost. Guess what? Not every type of injury is even listed. Nerve damage, brain damage, loss of balance or endurance for example, let alone pain and suffering.

Management's actions were clearly against everything that Lockheed Martin purports to stand for.  \r\n\r\nWhen I stood up to the pressure I became persona non grata. When I contacted their \"Ethics\" organization I was immediately dismissed and sent back to my program HR, which had failed to support me in the first place. \r\n\r\nThe program manager who had tried, through my direct boss to pressure me into hiring a friend of his who was not the best qualified for the position and would have cost the program thousands of unnecessary dollars to accommodate, flat out lied to me about the fact that he had a personal stake and relationship with the unqualified person I refused to hire. He also felt it necessary to suggest that somehow I had used poor business judgment by not making the hire, even in spite of the fact that I hired someone better qualified and there were no problems or lack of performance. \r\n\r\nAbove and beyond that, the program had a revolving door of incompetent managers at the highest level as well as those to whom I directly reported. There were a number of instances where PII and SSI were not handled properly, so much so that it resulted in the withholding of award fees from the client. \r\n\r\nProgram management's incompetence and lack of basic client relationship communications and management talent resulted in multiple instances where money--ultimately tax payer money--was wasted and spent needlessly. There appeared to be no consideration or acknowledgment of this. \r\n\r\nRelated to wasting tax payer dollars, the amount of money paid to subcontractors was practically criminal. Again, this is money that goes from our pockets to the Federal government, to government agencies, to contractors and their subcontractors. \r\n\r\nIt was a generally poor morale and a toxic environment. There was a complete disregard for honest discussion of problems that had a direct negative and performance-impeding effect on my job. \r\n\r\nAll they seemed to care about was covering up for mistakes, including lying to the client, disingenuous talk to the staff, and favoring and promoting those who toed the Lockheed Martin company line."}, {"review_title": "Good Pay and Promotion - Poor Benefits", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "10 Jan 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay and promotion opportunities.", "cons": "Management spins off employees from LM Corporate to LM Operations Support to eliminate or greatly reduce pensions and other benefits.
