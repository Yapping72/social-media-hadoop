When this was made literally illegal in some states the policy was changed to \"strongly encouraged\" to make it up with overtime, and then reimplemented as soon as those laws expired.\r\n\r\nDoes not care about your career: There are a few experienced technical staff who have been at the company for years. The policy of upper management was that these overworked staff must be on all projects that required technical expertise, and any newer staff were just added expense to be cut. Recent employees therefore had no chance to learn from more experienced staff, as they were not allowed to be on projects with them. More recent employees are also not given any opportunities to develop skills on their own; even if they manage to get a technical position on a project, as soon as upper management noticed they would demand the recent hire be removed and replaced with long-term staff. Recent hires with technical skills are instead used primarily as placeholders, filling a position so that project managers can say that position is filled. They are given little work and removed as soon as a more experience long-term staff member is available.\r\n\r\nDoes not care about your time: You are required to assign all time worked in six-minute increments to projects, reported daily. Due to various bureaucratic problems and improper management, you will regularly be told with no notice that you are no longer on a project and will have to find something else by the end of the day to charge your time to. There is no overhead timecode, so you *must* find another project by the end of the day. Enjoy the regular frantic scramble to find some way to get paid!\r\n\r\nDoes not respect your well-being: The company's other prominent Covid policy was to immediately outlaw all use of video in remote meetings. While other companies were doing everything they could to keep employees connected, Lockheed was declaring that the bandwidth required was too expensive.
