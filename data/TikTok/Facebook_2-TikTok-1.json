Given the global hubs are only operational about 15months, that is a shocking stat. \r\n\r\n- toxic work environment. One that is heavily concentrated on office politics and conflict, every single person has been negatively impacted at all levels of seniority. Please look at linked in to see the number of senior, mid level and entry level people that quit after just a few months\r\n\r\n- zero work life balance. Leadership talk a big game about this, but do nothing to actually address it. \r\n\r\n- clueless leadership, most likely due to not having any tech experience. Talk out both sides of their mouths they have lost all credibility. \r\n\r\n- terrible benefits in comparison to industry peers. TikTok is a company that looks for ways not to re-imburse you for your own costs, never mind actually trying to give you anything additional. For example, wellness benefit is 550 euro. Facebook will offer 3k plus, but your recruiter will be telling you about how Tiktok aims to be the same. Disregard anything they say. What you should expect is to be paying for your own internet and phone 100%, and your own costs in numerous other situations \r\n\r\n- zero recognition for any work, never mind the extended 12 hour days and countless unpaid weekends you cover\r\n\r\n- culture. Everything is red taped so dont expect to move fast. Global culture is non existent - it is literally like having 5 different companies competing against each other than what should be 5 teams in 5 hubs collaborating with each other\r\n\r\nEvery time I login to work at TikTok, I die a little bit more inside.

Flexibility around working hours and arrangements. You are in minimum 9-6, no discussion, every day. \r\n- the communication is not just tedious and long, but merely impossible.

The decision making process is endless and problems forwarded are completely ignored. \r\n- distribution of responsibility and the power to act upon it is messed up. You keep reporting an issue, as above, it is being ignored, and at the end of the day you have to explain what happened\u2026as if you never mentioned it. And because you\u2019re not allowed to act upon an issue you identify, even though you could, you just watch the whole scenario evolve, knowing it\u2019ll be your fault. \r\n- they only pretend to care for their employees.

There are no \u2018whole team\u2019 meetings, only once in a month, it encourages a very separated work environment. \r\n- depending on your team there\u2019s not enough or too much work.

Very little support from your manager if you're a quiet person who prefers to do the job independently.

UNORGANISED IN ALL ASPECTS: This organisation and its leaders do not believe in processes. You will be expected to continue working in the same unorganised way as your team even if establishing new process would be a win for the entire organisation.\r\n\r\n2. AWFUL MANAGEMENT: I was discriminated and bullied by my manager and another colleague where HR turned a blind eye to the discrimination. Senior Managers are extremely inexperienced in managing team members - My manager was extremely unorganised and could not keep up with their own work let alone mine where I was expected to deliver without being given access to the right tools or resources to succeed. My manager even created TWO task lists where neither matched one another and was wondering why no progress was made despite sharing updates everyday and keeping them informed.\r\n\r\n3. NOTHING IS LOCALISED: Be prepared to feel overwhelmed and be expected to use bespoke tools and processes which are all written in Chinese including emails with no way to translate this information.\r\n\r\n4. TOXIC HR: I placed a meeting with the HR team who accepted my invitation and did not attend despite sharing follow-up emails - No apology was given or reason for being ghosted; extremely unprofessional.\r\n\r\n5. GENERIC JOB DESCRIPTIONS: Let's be real - TikTok is growing at such a fast rate that they dont know what they need or want in terms of resource. Be prepared to be underpaid and do a role suitable for 4 individuals and then be ready to be questioned by your manager on why no minimum progress has been made in one element of your role.\r\n\r\n6. ZERO WORK LIFE BALANCE: I was working 12 hour shifts including weekends and burnt out on my third week. My manager was aware of the hours I was putting in and did not recognise this hard work or effort - It was expected because they were also working on weekends and 12 hour shifts.\r\n\r\n7. UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS TO DELIVER: Your manager and team will expect you to deliver but will not give you the training and resources needed to set you up for success.\r\n\r\n8. ZERO DIVERSITY: There is no diversity internally or on the platform - No Diversity & Belonging groups.\r\n\r\n9. TOXIC TEAMS: The central team are extremely toxic and were an absolute nightmare to work with and would not be willing to support you or set you up for success.\r\n\r\n10. EGOS: My team had some HUGE Egos that felt bruised as processes and progress was made to unlock business efficiencies - No surprise as TikTok would fall head over heels for you if you've worked at Facebook or Google before. The jealousy was very real."}, {"review_title": "Talent Acquisition Partner", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Talent Acquisition Partner in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of opportunity to make impact\r\nExtremely collaborative environment\r\nWorking with smart and creative people", "cons": "Lots of processes still need to be ironed out (these are being worked on continuously)\r\nSome days the hours can be long - but the company is in hyper growth stage and this will likely level out"}, {"review_title": "Fast Paced", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 May 2021", "job_title": "Brand Partnerships Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Brilliant team, so many learning opportunities", "cons": "Long hours, too many clients, too much work"}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Social Media Content Moderator in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good vibes working environment, lots of opportunities to develop, many perks and benefits", "cons": "Performances are based not only on you but on your team as well, they don't reflect 100% how the employees are actually achieving."}, {"review_title": "Horrible WLB", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Manager in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Visibility and ownership over a number of projects; rapid pace and features get shipped at crazy speed", "cons": "No work life balance; long hours\r\nLack of transparency re: career growth and career leveling"}, {"review_title": "Amazing people but long hours", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people that you get to work with are truly amazing and really care about their jobs.

The way managers just seem to care about their own power base and building their little empires. The favoritism of the management rewards the wrong people (the so-called ''top performers'') for the wrong reasons.\r\nThey don't keep their word / make empty promises (about career perspectives and improvements that never happen).\r\n\r\nArbeitsatmosph\u00e4re\r\nIt's your worst nightmare. Nobody talks to anyone. Since only individual performance counts for the Chinese management and every minute, every mouse-click is tracked, the pressure is too high to join in casual conversation with your coworkers, but you can watch a never ending show of short videos instead.\r\n\r\nVorgesetztenverhalten\r\nDisturbing and disgraceful. Absolute lack of leadership and even basic management skills, but good at delegating tasks to others and basically let them do most of the work. Mostly absent during hard times or when painful decisions to what remained of the team had been or had to be taken. People the supervision didn't like or didn't know how to deal with, were sidelined or fired. The higher management and HR just stood by, watched and did nothing as the initially highly motivated team died a slow, but certain death.\r\n\r\nKollegenzusammenhalt\r\nI have never witnessed such a hostile and toxic working environment. The petty Machiavellian plots and schemes just never stop, the backstabbing goes on and on. People who are strong at self-promotion while ruthlessly downgrading their opponents thrive at this company. Because supervisors actively involve in this kind of behavior themselves, lend their ear to all the gossip and use it against people, they make this workplace a living hell.\r\n\r\nInteressante Aufgaben\r\nThe development of the app has been stunning, yet the tasks carried out in the Berlin office are mundane and extremely monotonous. Watching over a 1000 short videos everyday in a dark office building slowly but certainly turns your brain into a mush and give you nightmares you cannot imagine.\r\n\r\nKommunikation\r\nThe higher management has still to acknowledge there actually exist cultural differences between Europe and China, especially when it comes to human relations, communication styles and dealing with conflicts. Any major decisions will basically be passed along the chain of command all the way to the bottom where you are left to deal with it. No protective shield, no constructive discussions: just do it or get lost.\r\n\r\nUmgang mit \u00e4lteren Kollegen\r\nMost employees Bytedance hires are relatively young (23-35).\r\n\r\nKarriere / Weiterbildung\r\nThe company doesn't care about your career interests, they only care about their own business needs. So far, I have never participated in any serious training or had a conversation with HR about my career perspectives. When you do your job and you do it well, they just want to keep you there, right where you are. Competent and qualified people know better and move on.\r\n\r\nGehalt / Sozialleistungen\r\nThe salary used to be above average, but it seems somewhere along the way they changed their mind about that and now new employees make much less. This has led to a ridiculous pay gap between people who actually perform the same job.\r\n\r\nArbeitsbedingungen\r\nThe office is situated at the Potsdamer Platz WeWork area. The building (not the office) offers quite a magnificent view on the Tiergarten. The IT equipment, tables and chairs are OK. The air quality in the office is bad, especially during the night and on weekends.\r\n\r\nUmwelt- / Sozialbewusstsein\r\nBytedance doesn't mind to have flashy neon signs with the company's motto and flat screens with company propaganda wasting energy 24/7 and importing tons of cheap plastic marketing merchandise from China. Or fly in a tech guy from the USA to fix the internet.\r\n\r\nWork-Life-Balance\r\nWhen you work from 16 PM till 1 AM, there is no such thing as a Work-Life-Balance, doesn't matter which promises were made by the company's recruiters. Normal office hours are only to be enjoyed by the management and supervisors. If you do have two weeks of normal office hours, this will be presented to you as ''divine mercy'', although it will only help to further ruin your sleeping pattern and what is left of your health. (Don't mention home office. There is no such thing in China.)\r\n\r\nImage\r\nThe company obviously pumps a lot of Renminbi in glistening marketing campaigns to promote their apps, there have been some scandals concerning their apps, but the reality underneath the surface and the truth about the company remain mostly hidden for the moment. If the CPC-loyal company wants te become a global success, it really has to broaden its (eastern) horizon and be cool (instead of another big data monopolist-wannabe)."}, {"review_title": "Poor team and company environment", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 May 2020", "job_title": "Trust and Safety Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can learn a great deal about how TikTok and social media works.\nLearn from different cultures and people on the team\nYoung and vibrant workforce", "cons": "Next to no communication across offices or teams , no transparency, or clarity of work.\nOffice politics has greatly increased with poor hiring, rushed decisions on team structures and processes\nVery poor management decisions on understanding worker needs.\nExtremely long working hours with working and lack of respect or understanding of providing workers the respect and support they need to be working so long.\nUnderstaffed workforce in key areas is leading many to leave and burn out.
