You get to work with young and talented local professionals; 2.

Horrible talent management, they copy western companies' OKR and 360 degree performance review system, but TikTok leaders manipulated it in a way that you have to please your leader huge in order to get a good bonus as your 360 rating determines how much your bonus will be. That of course leads to a very top-down Chinese imperial management style. 2. Salary. HRBP and the team leads will try to negotiate so hard with you on your salary by leveraging the name TikTok which many believes it's the next Meta, but let's be honest, how far can TikTok go if they have a top-down management culture and bring in talents who later realise they're all underpaid? 3. Team leaders. Many of them are young and incompetent, they're in the lead position either because they know how to please the management or they are the loyalist, therefore, the more experienced talents will suffer big from inexperienced leads and unprofessionalism, they will feel very little chance to exceed unless they become a loyalist too. The team leaders' goals are very much for 360 performance review NOT because they want to bring impact, build a strong team nor nice culture. 4. Benefit. Many thinks employee benefit is good here, well, it maybe the case when the company was small and new here, it has been reducing employee benefits since ever, starts from hard salary negotiation by count in every cent of your flexible benefit and 3 months bonus you may or may not get (depends on how much your leader wants to give you), cheap lunch and snacks that are in trend to become worse due to cut in operation expenditure. 5. Corrupted leaders. Sexual harassment and hostile working environment are quite common, as mentioned, the result of a leader-pleased culture. 6. Resignation. This is a funny one. Let's say if your notice period is one month from 1 Nov to 30 Nov, then you agreed with HRBP to have your last day on 15 Nov, but you do not get paid for 1 Nov to 15 Nov in the end, because you need to pay back to TikTok for the shortened notice period from 16 Nov to 30 Nov! This is the most ridiculous policy i have ever experienced in my life... 7. Future outlook of social media platforms. In overall, weak moat for social media platforms like TikTok, look what happened at Meta and Twitter... TikTok has been expanding in oversea without a concrete plan since 2019, they do not even have headcount projection for each year, which means they could over hire without control. TikTok as the very few APPs that generates revenue, in current economic downturn, ad revenue will shrink, and when a Chinese company cuts its headcount, it can be brutal without anything like Meta gives employees 16 weeks salary, refer to what happened in tech sector in China. 8. My final advise, choose western companies over Chinese companies, for your own value system and mental health. TikTok may try to build its branding, but not if they understand the value of human dignity and respect."}, {"review_title": "growth opportunities", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Data Scientist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "a lot of growth opportunities if you join the right team", "cons": "poor work life balance, challenge to find the right resource"}, {"review_title": "pays well with good benefits", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Coordinator", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "pays well with good benefits", "cons": "long working hours, very fast-paced"}, {"review_title": "Nope", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Partner", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay and benefits are not too bad.", "cons": "Everything else.

If you escalate this to HR on call, you might get your money back, all depends on your luck.\n\n\u274c Organisation\n- The company claims to adopt a flat organisational structure, but employees (ie., managers) like to play politics and ranks at work.\n- Lack of a proper org chart for an organisation that has thousands of employees. - Inefficient communication paths between employees, departments & divisions - Lack accountability for actions or decisions at different management levels, hence slows down work and decision-making (everyone says it's not their job?)\n- Copycats & lack creativity: Tries so hard to copy literally everything that the other tech giants do without reviewing if it fits the org (ie., Facebook, Google etc. Even office swags looked similar in colours and style?!)\n- Core values are only for show or to mimic other tech firms. The leadership teams do not do what they preach.\n- Power struggle among hubs that impacted work efficiency. Leaders need to learn how to collaborate together.\n- Resignation process is tedious, apart from speaking with your manager and drop a formal notification, you are required submit an application on the app. Also, they may or may not pay the final salary on time.\n\n\u274c People\n- Extremely toxic environment, people backstab each other or play office politics to shine. Rude & competitive, even when they're not skilled.\n- Mass hiring for the sake of expansion, but literally ANYONE (with/without experience) can join the company, as long as you behave like a \"Yes Man\" during interviews.\n- Job mismatch is the biggest problem. When they're not capable of doing their own scope, they do other team's work instead.\n- A mix of candidates from fresh grads, public sectors, tech & private sectors for the SAME job level. So expect the inexperienced ones contribute nothing, but claim credits for everything.\n- Workplace bullying committed by higher level management is backed by HR, they'll try to brush it off or blame it on the employees.\n- HR & management level are pretty gangster, \"be candid and clear\" ONLY if you have good things to say. They take constructive feedback extremely personally and will most definitely ruin your performance reviews for as long as they can remember.\n \n\u274c Work\n- A huge discrepancy between actual work vs. job description. Job mismatch is a norm here. \n- Plenty of manual & duplicate work, because not all hires are familiar with basic tools or systems commonly used in tech firms.\n- Lack work life balance or unable to finish work within 8 working hours, mostly due to inefficiency, resistance to new changes/technology, manual or no processes to guide, lack of time management & prioritisation.\n- No flight plan or job progression paths for employees to work on next steps.

So many incapable people\nMany people are not qualified for their role, period. They don't know what they're doing and their communication skill is zero. Very rude but they think that they're doing their job well. Don't thinks their managers are giving 'candid' feedback to them.\n\n4. Bad culture\nEveryone is so competitive. They want to show their work to leadership and reply them first. I think it's partly the fault of the company's Bytestyles. Aim for the highest? You've gotta step onto someone's head to be the mightiest and highest of all. \n\n4. The company holds you back until the last moment.\nResignation process is messy. They don't pay your final salary by the day they said they would. They hold your pay as long as they want as if they hold grudges against you for leaving the company.\n\n5. No transparency in career opportunities\nSome people get promoted even before probation because they are favored by certain leaders. It's arbitrary and biased. No clear paths for progression either."}, {"review_title": "No work life balance", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Sales", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Exciting app with lots of potential", "cons": "No work life balance, micromanaging, toxic culture"}, {"review_title": "Intern", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Intern in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good company, nice team and colleagues.", "cons": "I had a pretty good time in TT"}, {"review_title": "Messy organisation", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 May 2021", "job_title": "Business Analyst in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Very good salaries and benefits (deliveroo vouchers, gifts during festivals and flexible benefits)\r\n- Flexibility to work from home \r\n- Company do have significant growth opportunities outside of the china market", "cons": "- Lack of diversity and inclusion: very Chinese culture and if you cannot speak mandarin it will be tough for you.

This results in a lack of visibility of what materials are available internally. Finding documentation is the most valued skill in this business.

One of TikTok's values is 'Always Day 1'; sometimes it feels like this because even finding out the most basic things requires you to research or reach out to 10 people before you find someone responsible for it. - Work-life balance. Depending on your team, having a life is considered optional. Working late hours is glamorized as \"building the rocket ship while we fly it\". Some female leaders without kids openly question the work ethic of mothers, especially after the work-from-home policy has been revoked. Recently, a conversation was leaked to the press during which an exec member questioned the need for maternity leave in general. - Career development is difficult. Most teams follow a flat hierarchy, so there are few ways to move up. Title changes are common but don't go hand in hand with pay rises. Performance reviews are highly biased and usually rely solely on internal feedback . External reviews are not taken into account.

They'll offer you $100+ for a role, and then come back and say it's actually only $30k less and they read someone elses offer to you, after you already accepted the original offer. Disorgnized much? Their benefits are not covered 100% unless you're alone. Have a spouse/partner? oh boy. Have kids? RIP. Their \"WFH\" stipend isn't actually a stipend and it's a reimburesement that's double taxed. That's fun. Let me buy equipment I have to have to work here because they don't use things from external companies and they make their own (oh boy, that's another con) submit to get it reimbursed with the check you pay me to work for, and then get it taxed again?? So it's like a 60% reimbursement? Not 100%? Because that's 20% taxed each time! Lets hope you aren't close to a tax bracket besties, may the odds be ever in your favour. The \"Hybrid\" schedule isn't actually hybrid if you mandate precisely which days people HAVE to report to office. Saying 2-3/5 is fine, but when you tell us it has to be 2/3 dates you offer as an option does not prove flexible like their recruiters tap dance around to word just the right way. Interesting right?

This is used to stop pay transparency, and because they KNOW their \"lead\" level employees are doing manager level duties, and their manager level employees are at a senior manager level. Their leads are their \"Associate leads\" -- if you need further proof visit TikTok and look at why people leave and what they have to say about salary transparency, particularly for a role one individual left in New York that had a salary budget 40k less than what the individual in the role was making before they left.

Unusual (lack of) pay increase practices upon promotions / internal movements that are not in line with EU/US standards. \r\n\r\n-External big tech candidates come here for one year from lower roles at their respective companies, take on a steppingstone role at TikTok (blocking loyal, passionate internal candidates from progressing) and leave TikTok after a year or so (this has been a schema...), then TikTok again goes for a fancy name on a CV of the external candidate, and the cycle continues... \r\n\r\n- Setting unrealistic goals & accuracy targets for content moderation teams that are constantly not achieved, considering a poor state of TnS policies, their constant ambiguity / lack of detailed, comprehensive policy enforcement instructions. Ineffective TnS policy teams. There's been no improvement in that domain in the last 2 years and some rare policy changes actually made the moderation even worse. Enormous multitagging per piece of content leading to frequent policy contradictions and ambiguity (management forgot that \"the less is more!\", look how FB or YT does it). \r\n\r\n- Wrong people in Policy Manager and Policy Issue roles (too many hires from FB who turned out to be not so great talent or external hires without content moderation experience at all - they obviously have struggled to create comprehensive moderation-wise effective policy guidelines for more than 2 years. Too many subjective arbitrary decisions on a Policy Managers' level as to how to enforce content policies which create huge confusion among QA and moderation teams (80% of TnS Quality Analysts comes from working for other big tech) and those subjective PM's policy decisions are not in line with TnS industry standards. This is even more visible in other than main video workflows (\"Features\"). \r\n\r\n-There is a glass ceiling for QAs and other Ops teams when it comes to internal movement outside of TnS QA department e.g. The policy or PnP / Market integrity. The company prefers hiring external candidates for policy (or more specific aka \"speclialized\") roles not knowing that better talent is hidden inside the company, trapped in Ops roles like MS, QA SME, QAs etc. It's easier to get a policy specialist role at Google or Twitter being their contractor or 100% external candidate then getting a policy role at TikTok from a senior FTE position at TikTok's TnS Ops (sad!). Actually, TikTok does not have any policy specialist (level) roles, there is a big gap between Market Specialist and Policy Manager level. \r\n\r\n- Very poor and ineffective internal recruitment process for internal candidates. I was rejected 4 times for roles where 20 stakeholders told me I would be a great candidate because they knew my outputs and actual samples of my works.

They hired too many people too quickly during the pandemic, meaning that they aren\u2019t able to reward enough people accordingly at each review period. Lots of frustration within the team among people who actually work hard; you\u2019ll see people who constantly take credit for other people\u2019s work or who suck up to senior management get rewarded with promotions. \r\n\r\nLack of clarity over titles, job levels, and pay rises. Many legacy leaders in the company who lack industry or managerial experience and are currently leading departments. Recruiters tasked with hiring so many people so quickly that many employees slip through the cracks who simply don\u2019t have the right experience or are simply unprofessional: during my tenure, at least 5 people were fired (1 for faking experience on her CV and 1 for getting drunk in front of clients!!) and at least another 15 who resigned. Several were signed off by doctors for burnout and stress. \r\n\r\nYour experience will be entirely based on department. Departments that report into China will face constant team re-orgs (literally every other week), people being demoted, zero work life balance (constant messaging throughout the evening), communication issues (language barriers, meetings conducted in Chinese, team members getting shouted at in company wide meetings), goals changing every 2 weeks, strategy that is not applicable to the market getting dictated to you\u2026the list goes on. The strategy is a MESS (all short term goals, zero long term vision) and many people are hired for positions that don\u2019t even exist - then told on their first day that they\u2019re getting relegated to a position they a) didn\u2019t even apply for and b) don\u2019t have relevant experience in. Aggressive goals and stress from senior management breeds a competitive environment with zero team culture; team morale is super low. They make it very clear to you that employees are replaceable, and will treat you as such.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell: it really depends on department but in general, expect to be underpaid, frustrated by either incompetent colleagues or senior management, and treated like a tiny cog within a big machine. The incentive to stay here is to get the name on your CV and make some friends - then go elsewhere for a better salary and benefits. I learnt a LOT in a very short time and made some lifelong friends, but I couldn\u2019t see myself staying here longtime\u2026it\u2019s hard seeing everyone around you also being worn down, and I witnessed many people whose mental health was seriously affected."}, {"review_title": "Decent place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good culture and nice colleagues", "cons": "Can\u2019t think of anything right now"}, {"review_title": "Don't join the Rocketship!!!", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Recruitment", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Got to work with some great people.", "cons": "Company has a poor work-life balance.

I did not anticipate how large of the role would be 'ByteDance' (parent company) vs. TikTok. No knowledge sharing across orgs (e.g. side of business that makes money and/or user side).\r\n\r\n\u2022 Nickel & dime with salary - TikTok is rapidly hiring and is somewhat at the advantage of being the 'hot' place + send low-ball offers (I was borderline offended when I got my first offer; nearly 75% less than what I was making at the time) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Wouldn't bank on an IPO (at least anytime soon): In salary negotiations,, they focused on the 'pre-IPO stock' as being key in the total compensation package (so they could pay you less in direct cash). In all honesty, I would not be surprised if this company never went public. The amount of information they would need to disclose would be radically different from how the company operates today. They were set to IPO a while back on on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (to appease the Chinese government), but this got axed amid the anti-trust investigations towards Alibaba, etc. \r\n\r\n\u2022 High turnover - a fast growing company is great, but a fast growing company with fast turnover is a sign. After losing several people on my team (also - my recruiter quit while she was working with me!), it definitely impacts morale. Few are committed for the long-term. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Non-existent culture: If you're coming from another big tech company, don't expect anything like what you had previously. Whether or not the Google's of the world are actually committed to their mission statement is up for question, but ByteDance's mission (which does not exist) would be 100% growth at all costs. It feels a bit brutal. \r\n\r\n\u2022 China-based: This was probably the most jarring part when I first began. Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) is in Mandarin \u2013 emails, internal chats, documentation. I would estimate 90% of engineering teams sit in China, so communicating with them is nearly impossible due to 1) time difference and 2) language barrier. This, of course, impacts every team (as we are reliant upon them to build what is needed). \r\n\r\n\u2022 Working Hours/Expectations: Aside from the fact that the China-based teams are regularly *required* to work on weekends to balance 'holidays', working with these teams means late night/early morning meetings all the time. If you're up for that, great - if you have kids or just would prefer to not start work before 7:30am and end at 8:30pm, I would be cautious. \r\n\r\n\u2022 No organizational structure - ByteDance believes in a 'flat culture' (which does not work for a 100k personal company) - you have absolutely no way at all to know who works on what. Onboarding was a total nightmare because of this - you just have to speak with people who are more tenured to know who does what."}, {"review_title": "Collaborative But no Room for Growth", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Ad Operations in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Tik Tok has a great collaborative Environment, but not much room for growth", "cons": "No room for growth here."}, {"review_title": "Changing all day", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "14 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can learn things faster \nOne of fastest growing company", "cons": "The environment is changing so many times"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Quality Analyst in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Career advancement, benefit, perk, food and snack", "cons": "No transparency, salary is very secretive, unfair judgement, rat race/ toxic"}], [{"review_title": "The Center of Excellence is not Excellent", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Training Manager in Nashville, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- You are working for TikTok", "cons": "- Management in Nashville lacks ethics and leadership (gossip, sharing employee\u2019s personal information, toxic work environment that starts at the top)\n- Compensation and benefits (RSUs, Bonus percentage, food allowances) vary wildly \n- Bonuses, promotions and benefits are awarded to favorites only \n- The rules and expectations vary by employee"}, {"review_title": "Culture has its bright sparks but salary needs to be reviewed", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- A chance to make an impact, with leads willing to listen to ideas\r\n- Good team culture which is always being reviewed", "cons": "- Salary compared to competitors is really poor, consistently see employees leave for this reason"}, {"review_title": "Average", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Quality Assurance", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not good not bad average", "cons": "They do not have a system"}, {"review_title": "Moderating and taking care of the safety of the platform", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Community Content Management Specialist in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A lots of benefits such wif, gym, food", "cons": "Difficulties in the career progression"}, {"review_title": "Good in general", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Senior Quality Analyst (QA) in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Many opportunities to grow inside the company", "cons": "So much work to do in a daily basis"}, {"review_title": "Stay away", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Jul 2022", "job_title": "CoreOps Specialist in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can\u2019t think of any pros", "cons": "I don\u2019t know where to start.\r\n-the recruiters will tell lies just to lure people into accepting job offers- the contracts are very vague or not specific enough so the recruiters are not \u201ctechnically\u201d contradicting but they are lying by promising and reassuring about things that are not true.\r\n-vendor mindset.

You have managers, even as high as your +3, randomly jump in on things without context and as a leader myself, this creates more overhead than adding value.

What\u2019s that? The default is that if your calendar is open, it\u2019s fair game. That applies to 6am - midnight.

Not so at Tiktok. People are harsh, curt, possessive and not strong on collaboration.\n\nI once raised some of these points with a senior leader and I was told - \u201cif you\u2019re not happy, leave\u201d.

Since bimonths are short, it's hard enough to hit aggressive sales quotas. Uncapped commissions will allow us to make up for the bimonths we miss and will allow us to sell more effectively during the bimonths our clients are in the position to spend more. Many advertisers don't have a continuous upward trend in budget, but experience cyclical spend depending on seasonality and business needs. Also, many sales orgs do not have a commission cap in the Silicon Valley so it seems counter intuitive to implement commission caps if we are trying to retain top sales talent.\r\n- I feel bamboozled.
