Eventually, she was let go. Mind you, she was only a temp herself. Somehow, her friends found out I reported her. They went and reported me for talking about TikTok\u2019s and my boyfriend working in a nursing home. Neither were inappropriate, but they put a grain of truth in their lies so I couldn\u2019t deny 100%. I was instantly fired. No talking to or anything. They actually fired me over a voicemail. I was told that due to then nature of what I talked about, they didn\u2019t think it was fair to the women if I came back on the premises. Later, my old coworkers heard these women bragging about getting me fired. I told my rep through the temp agency and was essentially told \u201ctoo bad\u201d.

WRONG. In reality, CSA's are responsible for maneuvering Citi's endless interdepartmental bureaucracy on behalf of financial advisors. It is 100 percent an administrative role. You will be a workhorse to complete administrative tasks for up to 4 financial advisors that you may or may not ever meet in person. You won't have a clue how to do anything. Your middle-level manager may or may not ever learn your name. You will be dependent on a severely underqualified and understaffed Field Services team to support you. At this point, I rarely call them because 90 percent of the time they are wrong or don't follow through on the requested task at hand. Speaking of unhelpful departments, Supervisory (OSJ and RSO) completely run the show at Citi and I strongly believe their entire function is to turn business away at any and all cost. They make even the most basic task, such as a wire transfer or account maintenance, feel like you're running an uphill marathon. They are zero help. For example, say you're missing something in a complex account corporate account opening, instead of pointing out what you are missing - they will leave a note that says \"call field services.\" Out of spite, I call them directly. Speaking of automation, there is absolutely zero at Citi. All reviews are done manually. Further - there's no kind of notification system for when a review is complete. You have to manually check everything. What year is it again? The technology in general is about 25 years behind our competitors. We use four different CRM systems that don't communicate with each other. They are all clunky and are about as user-friendly as a broken computer. Get used to frequent software crashes because Citi only pays for the minimal amount of bandwidth to keep servers operational.

They ordered everyone back to work while the cafeteria and gym are under construction. There's no coffee available. The traffic on the Tampa campus is unbelievable. Yet, the NY'ers still want everyone in the office. Also, people who are in Tampa will not get the same work assignments or promotions as New York. It's because the NY'ers are afraid of losing their jobs so they keep job security by hoarding a lot of projects and promoting people differently.
