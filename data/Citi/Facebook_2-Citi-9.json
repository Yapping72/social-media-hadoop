I heard this from multiple leaders. FYI if you'd compare AVP salaries in India, citi will be at the bottom. Again attributed to point 1. These guys have no clue about other banks who've set shop in India and their culture.\r\n4. People who are your onshore counterparts are again smarter virtusa employees who made the right move at the right time. They think of Indians as coolies and behave as if they own us.\r\n5. They don't give you a laptop and almost no Chinese phones work, these are needed for you to perform your daily activities. You need to buy these if you dont have them. No internet for AVPs and above. As if a new joiner wasn't working in the pandemic with another firm. You are being paid well, can buy one is their answer when you ask them. Forget furniture.\r\n6. The recruiters will do anything to make you join early. They would tell you that you wont be considered for an appraisal if you join in October but later you'll get to know you bought you notice period for nothing because you needed to join in august.\r\n7. I found the orientation a namesake. The HR would refuse to take your questions; they've themselves miserly allocated time to the session. Direct you to a faceless defunct system for your questions. New Joiners will have doubts and you need to get them clarified. Shouldnt have a dissatisfied employee from day one, basics of HR I guess. \r\n8. Very poor work life balance.
