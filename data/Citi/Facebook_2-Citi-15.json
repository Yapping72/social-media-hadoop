There are often fights between rows over who is making more noise that is preventing people around them from working. (lots of people sing, hum, drum on their desks, etc.) Citi has a policy where they want managers to become involved in an employees private life. My opinion: I have two lives - one at work and one at home. Should they ever intermingle it will be at my discretion, not forced by corporate policy. My ex-boss was more interested in having an after-hours drinking and dinner buddy than a dedicated and knowledgeable employee. Declining invitations (more like demands) to attend after-hours and weekend team events (most often team only, no spouses or family) was frowned upon and caused very hard feelings. So the only way to stay employed and get good reviews was to play the \"happy team player\" game, even at the expense of causing issues at home. You can learn a lot but there is a common reality at Citi: What you learn at Citi can be used ONLY at Citi. They take packages from vendors like Oracle and modify them to fit Citi's specific needs. Not a problem, but they do sooooo much tweaking and morphing that when they finally get the package to where they want it, it's so far removed from the original package (the one everyone else in the world uses) that it's impossible to take the knowledge you obtain at Citi and use it for any other employer."}, {"review_title": "Not the best banking company, does not value talents", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Corporate Action Analyst in Tampa, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting tasks, not too much pressure", "cons": "Performance and results are not rewarded at all.

They knew they are part of large multinational but very small part of it in the U.K. where they could throw their weight around. So be careful with your managers. If you want to make your career with Citi ensure you be in your managers good books by doing the following:\n1. Be prepared to learn everything on the job within 3 months so that you pass probation and become permanent otherwise they will keep on reminding you that they can still throw you out.\n2. You will be expected to work extra hours before at least 1 hour of your working hours and up to 3 hours after your official day is over. I usually left work after 7 or 7.30pm.\n3. If you're someone who is punctual and serious about your work and never take any unplanned off you're expected to always stay fit but if you're a regular offender and get ill once a month then you're considered to be worthy of your job but with little health issues. And if you are your manager' referral then even better.\n4. Their grievances procedure is a joke they invite you with a preset mind and they have internal senior employees from Citi's different work group as your assessor. Who will listen to you as if they are the epitome of being just and fair but they are just another higher management who is interested in the extra money they are paid to do the extra work.\n5. Citi HR is not helpful at all so if you have problems with you seniors find another job as HR is not interested to hear your problems\n\nIn a nutshell, Citi was a mistake I made. I have very deep emotional stress about my tenure with Citi.

Mortgage professionals who work here after working for other organizations in the industry quickly leave due to the inability of Citi to close a loan adequately and do business the right way.  Many mortgage consultants have no previous mortgage experience so they have difficulty understanding just how badly CMI is when it comes to doing business.  This is also true of the operations staff as well, who are truly clueless when it comes to closing a loan in a reasonable period of time.  The average time to close a loan at CMI is between 60-90 days where the industry average is less than 30.  Typical pipeline pull through is less than 60% from application to closing where the industry average is around 90%.  Instead of simply creating a better process flow for mortgages to close, executive management simply makes all clients pay for a 90 day rate lock which ultimately makes the organization less competitive.  After working for a number of top organizations in the business for the past ten years it is very obvious that there is cowardice of management where no one is willing to step outside their comfort zone and fix the glaring problems that plague the organization.  Moral is VERY low due to two major issues... first, nearly all leaders above a sales manager, which is department heads all the way up to Sanjiv have never originated or closed a loan themselves and are completely clueless on how the business works.  Second, the organization is disinterested in becoming more efficient leaving employees to languish in the mediocrity.  It is truly sad that they are not any more positive things to say about this organization.

I had the opportunity to work with some bright and talented staff there, but sadly their contributions are eclipsed by the cons that you will read about below.", "cons": "During my short time with the organization, I witnessed some of the most appalling examples of poor management decisions I have ever observed in my career. Leadership at the site level holds a philosophy that non exempt employees must be kept happy at any cost, regardless of the negative impact to the business. It is known by the staff all through the department I worked in that employees could get away with performance and conduct that in any other organization would mean dismissal from your job. As a people manager, it is exceptionally difficult to lead your team to perform to the business expectations, as employees saw many examples of peers maintaining their jobs even when they repeatedly failed to meet the business expectations or engaged in poor conduct (In some situations, there have been employees who failed to meet objectives for years, and were allowed to continue their employment). This abject failure of leadership at this site made it extremely difficult to have any meaningful impact on  the job performance of your assigned group. \r\n\r\nJust to highlight some of the examples of these failures:\r\n\r\n-Employees who displayed issues with repeated absenteeism are rarely dealt with accordingly. I observed many examples of staff regularly missing time well beyond what's stated as allowable in the employee handbook, yet little is done to dissuade the employees from engaging in this behavior. They may be engaged in a disciplinary action process, but very, very few of those ever result in the employees separation even in light of the behavior continuing. This in turn causes issues with making sure they are appropriately staffed which trickles down to impacting the clients, not to mention allowing for the behavior to perpetuate across the business. \r\n\r\n-There were many, many examples of scenarios where customers were treated very poorly by the front line staff, with the outcome often times being the mildest of disciplinary action. There is a party line in the department about \"no tolerance\" behaviors, which is completely false. No one was every out right terminated outright for treating customers poorly, regardless of how grievous the situation was. I personally witnessed several examples of this, where individuals engaged the clients in such a rude and condescending manner, that the clients immediately terminated their relationship with the bank. This behavior was met the a simple slap on the wrist, even though that conduct in all of these scenarios cost the bank significant amounts of revenue. \r\n\r\n-The front line leaders of the business are not respected, as the staff knows that they will not held accountable for their behaviors and performance. There were employees who were outright disrespectful and insubordinate to their immediate supervisors, and very little was done to address these types of issues. It wasn't uncommon to hear about interactions where a staff member would outright tell their supervisor they would not follow a directive issued, and have virtually no consequences as a result. H/R representation at the site level has been complicit in this situation as well, often times advocating for the retention of the employee even in the face of this misconduct. Probably the best example of have the how a blind eye was turned to some of the gross misconduct was a leader being called profanity to their face by a staff member (which there was no argument by either side that this incident occurred) and nothing was done beyond a weak attempt at a verbal warning about the employees conduct. \r\n\r\n-Operations leaders spend a majority of their time in their offices, completely removed from observing how the respective area runs. While they spend much of their time looking at the end result (metric performance) they spend virtually no time understanding how those teams are achieving those results. This \"head in the sand\" approach to leading their departments has led to some rampant impropriety among some of the leaders in their areas in the attempt to achieve the expected performance metrics. Additionally, the operations leaders all seem to fail at making the tough decisions necessary when it's required. I have observed all of them take a softshoe approach to the bad behavior in their respective areas. It's also not uncommon to hear of the Operations managers overturning a decision by the front line supervisor when one of their staff members expresses a concern about a directive. It's been my observation that these leaders wish to avoid confrontation at all costs, and will give in to the employee requests regardless of the short and long term impact to the department. This failure in leadership has resulted in many of the front line supervisors developing an apathy towards their roles and responsibilities, as they feel shackled by a culture that values employee satisfaction over all, even if the employees satisfaction comes at the detriment to the business, and more importantly, the clients.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are considering taking a job at Citi, especially as a leader, it's important to understand this is the culture that's in play as of the writing of this review.  Somewhere along the way, striking that balance between the satisfaction of the staff and the needs of the clients and the business has been lost. If you're looking to work in an environment where you are allowed to lead your team in meeting the goals and objectives of the company, I would strongly advise you to look elsewhere. You will be relegated to going through the day to day motions of leading, without actually being able to affect any real change.  It's very likely you will find yourself disappointed and frustrated by the experience."}, {"review_title": "It was educative.

But then...", "cons": "\"Pandit the Bandit\" put Citimortgage on its list of distressed assets. The \"leadership\" started closing processing centers during a time of historical loan volume when consumers needed to refinance their mortgages MORE THAN EVER  to get out of the ARMS and keep their homes. If Citi had its way- they wouldn't lend anyone money and they would have sold Citimortgage. But they couldn't because they took TARP.\r\n\r\nCustomers were waiting 5 and 6 months to get thier loans refinanced appraisals had to be re-ordered because it took Citi so long to process a loan that the appraisal expired. Lending Consultants were being over-worked and over-stressed working 60 and 70 hours a week- only to not get paid because the incompetent operations teams that were left were not able to get things processed. \r\n\r\n\"Pandit the Bandit\" decided the answer to all of this was to open call centers for loans. Citi could save money and \"help\" more clients. Yet they are training these people to sell refis that aren't even good for clients. Is your rate 5.25% right now- great pay a point and we can get you 5.125%.  You pay 4k in fees to save $25 a month. You do a loan that has no benefit for you- but you think you did something great because your rate is lower. All the while Citi makes money and Citi can say they are using TARP funds to help people. Great plan.\r\n\r\nYet, clients who really need to refinance can't get thier loans closed. If you want to go to a bank to see a real loan officer at Citi- good luck because they can't wait to quit. When they do-they won't be replaced because now there is a recent high school grad telesales loser waiting at the end of an 800  number at a call center who can't wait to sell a client something they don't need and who knows absolutely NOTHING about lending.\r\n\r\nI ask you Bandit- isn't this mentality what got us into this mess in the first place? Selling loans to make a buck and not caring if you are helping people? That's what put us here. Yet you happily do it again under the guise of using TARP to lend. It's all a lie.

Anyone who questions senior management is treated badly.  Some senior staff have too much power and there are no controls over how they use it.  Morale among staff is low - people do not feel respected or valued.  You are simply a disposable commodity.  Employees with problems related to their role or manager have nowhere to turn for support.\r\n\r\nPeople are never sure whether they are at risk of redundancy .  A lot of knowledgable, competent staff have been made redundant with seemingly little forward planning - this has left huge gaps in some areas.  \r\n\r\nThe appraisal system is supposed to feed into pay/promotion but in reality it does not - ratings on appraisals are in some areas decided solely by a senior manager with no knowledge of individuals' performance.  There are no controls to prevent these decisions being made on personal grounds and there is no way to contest them.\r\n\r\nOn a day to day basis, the company has many policies and procedures and endless monitoring by different departments - including repeated monitoring of the same things where there is no need for it.  \r\n\r\nThere are too many layers of management which results in work creation.  \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of box-ticking and endless different layers of approval are needed for even the tiniest decision, which is frustrating, especially if you are used to having accountability for your own work.  Small tasks take too long and important issues are sidelined.  On the other hand, there is a reluctance at senior level to take accountability for important issues.\r\n\r\nEverything that needs support is either outsourced or handled remotely, which means it is difficult to speak to a human about any issues of any kind that arise whether people or IT related.  IT problems, for example, must be logged via a complicated online method, take a long time to resolve and there is no way of discussing them with a human being when they are (invariably) not fully resolved.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the company talks a lot about how well staff are treated.  Staff are pressured into completing 'voluntary' and 'anonymous' surveys, the results of which are manipulated to play down the negatives.  Some managers are allowed to probe into which employee gave which answer. \r\n\r\nThe company claims to value talent but this only seems to apply at senior level.
