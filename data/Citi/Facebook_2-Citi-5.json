You can go weeks with your manager not even so much as saying hello to you. \n\nThe work\nRepetitive and boring.

You are made to complete additional \"goals\" which coinicentally is presentational work that should be completed by managers, leaving staff to concentrate on the already high work load they have on their plates. You are told its for your \"progression\" yet not many promotions actually come up. When they do come up, it seems to be those who stay all hours of the night to work get promoted rather than the efficient workers who attempt to have a half decent social life.\n\nOverall, if you work here, you will be overworked, stressed and fed up.

The team I work in is intended to improve problematic processes, which can be found all around the firm (and hence the Consent Order from the OCC). Unfortunately, the manager in charge of the team is one of the most ineffective I have come across. He is unable to clearly offer direction, end goals, resources, or even simply track daily tasks. There is no project management system in place, so that in weekly meetings (that have no scheduled agenda) team members have to remind him over and over again about what is happening. What's worse, he is constantly checking his phone during these meetings and not paying attention. Most of the projects we end up doing are initiated by sudden requests/whims from his superiors, which are not necessarily suited for our team, not properly formulated, and lead to dead ends. Overall, a frustrating experience.\n\nFYI: My exit process was like this. After sending a sincere and detailed email to my supervisor explaining my decision to resign, his response was, \"Okay, thanks for letting me know. Have a great weekend.\" When I asked him what steps I should take to inform HR, there was no follow up. After finding information to process my resignation in Workday, a few days later I received an automated link to an anonymous exit survey that was broken. That's it.
