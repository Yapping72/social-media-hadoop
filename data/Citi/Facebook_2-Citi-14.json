Its one of the two legal entities of Citicorp in India (Citibank & CSIL). The idea of forming this company was plain and simple \u2013 Cost Saving. As Citi had outsourced most of its IT business to other IT service companies, So by cost perspective it made sense to top management that what if we start our own IT service firm in a low cost country like India and in-source some of the IT business back to Citi.  So, CSIL was formed as a regular IT service organization which will hire IT people, get the project, deliver it to Citi and get paid by Citi by number of hours their employee spent on execution of that task..like any other service company. Make sense to save cost, but does everyone in Citi on-boarded by this idea... HELL NO. People sitting in US at middle management has their own agenda, Vendors who are in Citi for years and suppose to handover their tasks has their own agenda, people sitting here in CSIL has their own and this has started a mess rather than a place to work.\r\n\r\nLet me explain why. Most of the Citi IT employees in US are Indian. They are there for many years and when they started to realize that if things will be started getting delivered from India, ultimately they will be asked to go back. Whats the point of paying a manager in US when his entire or most of the team is in India. This started a triangular fight for survival. Companies which are handling Citi's IT for long are not happily handover their task to CSIL for obvious reasons, IT managers sitting in US are supporting them so that they can see CSIL fail and stay put in US. They started recruiting those vendor resources on Citi's payroll in US and building a team there to justify that some critical tasks are being handled by Citi Employees and the management at CSIL India is fighting to get projects from Citi and show them as delivered to prove their significance. So, when you join CSIL, first you have to fight for good work that is not at all there. Only substandard work that Citi employees in US or their vendors doesn't want to do, comes to CSIL. So after 8-10 years if you was asked to do work that is not going to add anything in your career, its not logical to do just for money. Obviously CSIL is paying better then Indian IT service companies because they are replacing people sitting in US by CSIL so even if they are paying little bit extra, its just a fraction of US pay. But the main thing is 'work and learning' and only thing you can learn is office politics to get some relevant work so that at the end of year you have to show something. \r\n\r\nThe worst nightmare (which is the most of the case in CSIL) is if your manager is sitting in US. Since he/she doesn't like the idea of CSIL for the reason I explained above, he might schedule a call at mid-night. If top management is forcing vendors to handover some important project to CSIL, your call might be scheduled at their post lunch hours, so you have to be awake till 2 AM and see call gets canceled at 1.50 AM. Everything is happening here because everyone is trying to survive and save their jobs. You might get a designation which might be so fascinating like AVP or VP but get ready to be dictated by these vendor resources because most of them are in Citi for 8-10 years and god know what they are doing for so long in US. \r\n\r\nNow the management of CSIL, they are already amused and just trying to save their highly paid jobs. In every management call, they have to listen that this center is not performing, attrition rate is always around 30%, so why should not close this center or sell it to some other IT service provider. With the reputation CSIL is building, it will not take long that either CSIL or some of the units that are not performing will be sold off. And for this reason, it seems they are not investing much on this center. Very simple things, like there are no automated HR software..even if you have to declare your investments, it will be just in a homemade portal and after declaring you can't view it ever again!!! People are sitting in meeting rooms as the place is cramped etc etc. Obviously, CSIL is just an experiment and if you are going to join it, please be ready to be a part of that experiment. \r\n\r\nThere are lots of other things. If you know anyone there, just pickup the phone and ask how bad it is. And even after going through this review, you are going to join Citi for any reason \u2013 Welcome to the mess and please be sure to get an exit plan ready :)."}, {"review_title": "Personal Banker", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "8 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A company that you can be proud of.

Even though the branch hours are 10-5. You are required to start work at 830...yes.. 90 MINUTES BEFORE\nTHE BRANCH OPENS. Why? Because CITI uses\nOutdated pre historic technology. It takes 20-30 mins to log into your computer. Then 45 mins to do tedious un related to your SALES job activities like \"balancing the ATM\", night drop, debit card logs, and over 10 OPERATIONS related tasks. \nCITI is all about cost cutting, at the expense\nof their employees. They are removing the assistant manager role in most branches and replacing them with \"virtual assistant managers\". Basically forcing the bankers to pick up the slack in operations. \n\nEvery aspect of your day is watched carefully by your manager. It will start with \"scrubbing\" leads at 9am, basically getting a list of customers who you will call for 2 hours  to book appointments. This will happen EVERYDAY. Completely mindless job. \n\nYou are basically a glorified telephone operator. Majority of your time will be spent on the phone with the back office resolving customer issues and problems. You will go home feeling angry, depressed, and frustrated. Customers see it and feel it. \nEspecially with citi's policy on cash transactions.\nANY transaction involving cash(deposit, withdrawal, payment on credit card, etc..) requires the customer to present government issues ID, social security, and job occupation. Think about it. As a Citibank CUSTOMER, you have to present this every time if you don't have your debit card with you. RIDICULOUS. Daily shouting matches with customers about this. Employees and Customers BOTH HATE IT. \n\nThe only bankers at citi who earn decent commission are ones who have worked in that office for 10 years or more. Because they sell the same checking and saving promotions to the same customers every year. Example - customer opens savings account with 50k, keeps balance for 90 days. Earns 500$ bonus. Closes it out. Repeats every 6 months. Banker\nWill make commission on that same customer year after year. That will not happen for bankers who are NEW to citi. NEVER. After all the senior bankers retire, citi will have a hard time surviving.\nCiti recently pulled out of the TEXAS AND BOSTON market. After only a few years.

They treat their employees extremely poorly. As an employee, you are just a number.  They expect loyalty, but they give none to employees.  It is highly dysfunctional and business division heads resent one another.  There is no incentive for anyone to work together.   The culture is toxic and bankrupt.", "cons": "1) Abusive supervisors and institutional apathy:  I worked for this organization for 4.5 years and was promoted twice.  My supervisor had an extremely hot temper and continually verbally abused his employees.  Despite complaints to HR and notes on his performance review, his behavior did not change.  In fact, he was promoted.\r\n\r\n2) Treatment of former employees:  I left my job in the summer to attend graduate school and used my accrued vacation when I quit.  When I left the firm, my supervisor approved my vacation and my official end date was clear (and in the HR system).  Despite this, the firm continued to pay me via direct deposit for two pay periods.  Once they discovered this, they had to ask me when my end date was because their HR systems were in such disarray.  I asked me supervisor for details about how I was to repay the amounts and he passed it off to HR.  I received a letter from HR two months later simply requesting that I pay a flat amount.  I immediately sent a certified letter to Citi's \"overpayment coordinator\", my old supervisor and HR requesting data on the dates of the payments, the amounts of the payments, a statement that they would correct my W-2 and confirmation that they actually withheld taxes that they claimed they were owed.  No one bothered to reply to my letter.  1.5 months later, I received a call from a bill collector from CitiFinancial on Christmas Eve demanding that I return her call by 2 PM that day.  I called the bill collector and was spoken to quite tersely like I was a criminal or a deadbeat borrower.  I again reiterated my request to the bill collector and she claimed to be sending the data that I requested.  I have yet to see this data.  To date, I have not repaid the company because they cannot provide the data that they would provide an employee on a pay stub.  \r\n\r\n3) Immobility:  I was promoted twice, but because of my abusive supervisor, sought work in other departments.  Citi's HR policies required that a supervisor \"release\" an employee to take a position with another department.  This made it virtually impossible to move to a different department without quitting the firm.\r\n\r\n4) Restricted stock lost when returning to school:  I accumulated a substantial amount of unvested restricted stock after working for the firm for 4.5 years (most of my compensation was in the form of bonus, of which 25% was paid in unvested company restricted stock).  When I quit to return to graduate school to upgrade my skills, the firm required me to forfeit the unvested restricted stock that I had earned.  Such a practice is intended to prevent employees from leaving to go to other competitors.  The affect was to punish an employee for wanting to upgrade their skills.  I have no incentive to return to the firm.  I told HR this, but they did not seem to care.  They did not seem to care that they alienated a potential future employee, who would potentially be able to recruit classmates (from a top MBA program).  Clearly, they have no interest in long-term retention of employees.\r\n\r\n5) Extremely political:  Relations among business divisions are extremely dysfunctional.  I witnessed this after working in a staff position that dealt with the management of each top division.  They do not talk to one another and approach other business divisions in an adversarial manner.  The resulting culture is extremely toxic.  This system encourages employees not to work together and to develop deep-seated, bitter resentment toward their colleagues in other divisions.  \r\n\r\nThis list could go on!  I was somewhat annoyed while working for them, but became enraged at them by their treatment after I quit (not responding to simple requests for information and harassing me with an aggressive bill collector).  This is no way to retain talent.  Work here at your own risk."}, {"review_title": "Good from outside.

This place has one of the most toxic corporate cultures I've ever seen with around 80-90% of employees dissatisfied with their jobs. \r\n\r\n-Incompetent Senior Management; Senior management plays an annual game of musical chairs where they reshuffle/eliminate huge parts of the company instead of actually dealing with the real problems (kind of like demoing a building constantly instead of actually going in and making the necessary repairs)  and  in the process cause major disruptions to the functions of the company with any regard on how it actually impacts the operations of the company or the people employed.  In many cases, they will come in with an exact opposite philosophy to that of their predecessor instead of establishing any sort of continuity.  Not one project I've seen in my 10 years here has been driven to completion due to this constant half assing by Senior Management. This is not to mention that many of them happen to also be severe alcoholics that get wasted every day after work.  Just visit one of the bars around Tribeca and you'll see them in droves downing cocktails and shots (while sloppily trying to hit on their female coworkers). The company is also highly bureaucratic with many layers of redundant management; what some of them do is an absolute mystery. \r\n\r\n-Sociopathic/Selfish Managers:  I've only ever had one good manager in my time here that actually continued to drive my learning progress and allowed me to learn more than my actual function required.  The majority of managers behave like pimps and are very controlling and territorial and will attempt to limit your growth as much as possible so that you don't become a potential threat to them or eventually leave them.  They will also use you to benefit themselves and screw you over when they don't need you.  Performance Reviews are based on how much you get along with them and how much you are will to play along with their selfishly motivated agendas.  Teams/Divisions operate more like rival street gangs/fiefdoms that constantly compete with each other and will do what benefits them first and foremost before putting the company's interest first.  It's no wonder the company needed a bailout and failed 2 stress tests. \r\n\r\n-Internal Mobility:  This is pretty much an absolute joke.  99.9 %of internal positions are filled way before the job requisition hits the site.  The hiring managers usually know who they want (based on politics & favoritism) and post the position up as a formality.  HR is pretty much a useless and powerless function here that spews a bunch of politically correct jargon to make it appear like everything is fine and dandy.    \r\n\r\n-Promotion based on Meritocracy:  Another major sham.  Any attempt at even defending this is an absolute insult to the many hard working individuals that get screwed over year after year on promotions.  The company has a created a culture where it's become almost mandatory for you to leave for another company every 3-4 years in order to get a decent raise.  If you do end up getting lucky with an internal move, your move is deemed \"lateral\" usually and you won't get any raise in pay or title.  There is also a HUGE pay/compensation gap between Front Office and Back Office employees with Back Office getting screwed most of the time.  \r\n\r\nThe only REAL way to get promoted is if you come from a well off family that brings business to the company (like JP Morgan's Sons & Daughter's program) , have a father/uncle/boyfriend that works for a strong division and has a lot of pull with the hiring manager, or if you are a good looking girl that's willing to play eye candy (and possibly more) to fat middle aged sexually frustrated executives twice to three times your age.  The latter is by far the quickest way to get promoted here.   As a matter of fact, the higher up you go  floor-wise at 388, the better looking the girls get (senior executives sit on the higher floors).  I know a good looking girl that went from Analyst to VP in just one year and another that got hired as a VP with nothing but a degree in poetry and 0 experience in the financial industry."}, {"review_title": "Amazing co-workers and very diverse clientele", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Apr 2014", "job_title": "Analyst in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salaries are great and the clients you work with are superb.

There is so much red tape and bureaucracy - more than any firm I've ever worked in previously. You need to raise requests to do absolutely everything / anything. \r\n\r\nMost of the Americans staff are always online and I get the impression that a lot of them have no life outside of work. Some of the management that I came across really are on a different level and have zero in common with their staff. They seem to be almost brain washed, constantly speaking in corporate language, and clinical to the last with the most tedious task or request. These managers also do very little to improve that situation with employees and some do not possess any interpersonal skills whatsoever. \r\n\r\nThere was also zero training. We were given a booklet when I worked there to select training courses from and then informed 1 week later that there was nothing left in the budget! Then there\u2019s e-mails. You will get 100\u2019s if not 1000\u2018s per day. The Americans and especially the Indian employees love to e-mail constantly and keep you informed of things which don\u2019t concern you, your team, or your region. This means every morning you spend 30+ minutes sorting (deleting) all of the rubbish e-mails. I think these e-mail offenders want to be seen to be doing something so constantly e-mailing is one way of doing that. Some of them even e-mail to tell you their daily schedule or to tell you that they will be back in 10 minutes as they have to go pick up the kids! \u2013 thanks for letting the 500+ people on all of those distribution lists know!  \r\n\r\nYou are also forced to go to regular town hall meetings where some big whig will fly in to give updates. I found this very frustrating as I was always busy and when I went to these town halls I was coming back to even more work as my entire team had to attend. The updates were normally extremely boring and most people spent the hour or hour and a half texting / surfing on their phones (if you were lucky to be sitting at the back) or staring into space. And guess who were the only ones to ask Qs?.... yup, other managers / senior managers.\r\n\r\nMy job description didn\u2019t match the day to day aspects of the role itself and it was nowhere near as hands on as I was lead to believe at interview. The job was extremely silo\u2019d and you find yourself doing the same thing day in, day out. Some people don\u2019t mind this but it wasn\u2019t for me. In some cases you are expected to be at your manager\u2019s beck and call 24/7. In IT, On Call is often a requirement though this was not stressed to me at interview. On call payment was also not as much as promised.\r\n\r\nMy ex-boss was a real piece of work and no one in the team liked her at all, in fact 6 of us have left since January this year and most of the rest are looking for jobs at present. I don't think she ever smiled, she had a permanent scoul on her face, and if she passed you in the corridor she would never acknowledge you unless you were another senior manager or higher. She very rarely let us work from home - even though it was sold to us at interview how flexible Citi were and that working for a virtual team enabled us to WFH was available whenever we wanted. Not a chance. You were always quizzed why you wanted to excuse yourself for an hour to go to the doctors / dentist / personal issue and asked could you not reschedule outside working hours or at the weekend. It got to the stage where we just didn't tell her that we needed to leave for appointments, and we covered for each other if she came looking. She also wanted 1 on 1's every week. Mine was on the same day as our team meeting and a day after our wider team meeting, so I was regurgitating the same updates 3 times in just over 24 hours!. When I rescheduled my 1 on 1's to bi-weekly she marked me down in my appraisal for this even though it was 30 minutes wasted where I would be better working. She was rarely reachable as she would go to the opening of an envelope if it involved any possibility of networking in Citi. On MIM (Major Incident) calls she would dial in to announce her arrival, and then drop off and leave us to sort out the issue, taking all the glory afterwards and not handing out praise awards which every other manager seemed to do for any piece of work you completed. After my child was born she would not let me change my shift from 9-5 to 8-4 for a few weeks to help out at home with the new arrival despite the fact that there were other guys in the team who could adequately cover for each other. I think the quote was \u2018I\u2019ve no business need for anyone in the team to be in here at 8am\u2019. She advised an ex colleague not to apply for an internal job at a higher salary grade as he wouldn\u2019t get it \u2013 he applied and got it. She was the worst 'manager' I have ever had the misfortune of working for and anyone you ask about her, cannot stand her. \r\n\r\nA lot of jobs there in IT are now being out sourced to India but they are constantly hiring. You have to ask why there is such a high staff turnover. Citi to me was like being back at school and I could not wait to leave. I\u2019ve also never met as many people who absolutely hate their jobs / managers, but still stay there. This is possibly due to the higher salaries that they pay.\r\n\r\nThis firm is a walking talking clich\u00e9 of 'the office' and corporate culture that you will either love and thrive on, or detest and squirm in.

Like which websites you are browsing, which software you have opened. The active session you logged-in and the non-active session when you were log-out. In my projects, managers used to send emails to the employee if any team failed to have average DTA of 9 hours. It is like we are working in some cheap start-up company.\r\n\r\n- They will enforce you to have a minimum of 9 hours of DTA time and even if you miss by 30 minutes, the manager will escalate this and will pressurize you that it will reduce the overall DTA score of the team, So, we need to keep it minimum 9 hours but there is no bar for maximum as they want to make your work endlessly.\r\n\r\n- No work-life balance. Manager will expect you to work all 7 days in a week. They have created several WhatsApp groups in which they will keep messaging you to log-in from home whether it is weekend, public holiday or you just came from office on normal days. \r\n\r\n- Recently, they have closed the facility of WFH by stating that their employee don't do WFH sincerely but still forces many employees to login from home outside of their business hours. This company is the best use case of how to misuse the remote login facility. \r\n\r\n- In the name of the Agile, they will make any changes during the scrum and force you to deliver it on time and will make you pressurized if you don't delivery it on time or raise any concern over delivery\r\n\r\n- Due to the above reasons, you will mostly get the negatives to feedback from the Citi employees whether they are former or currently working over there. If you are your vendor to this company then it will be a hell for you.\r\n\r\n- During the interview process and pre-joining session, HR will tell you that they care for the employee work-life balance and gives lots of leaves. But in reality, very few lucky ones are able to utilize their leaves completely. \r\n\r\n- Due to this negative working culture, you will see that nowadays most of the employees who are joining them are from mostly service-based or they directly hire their vendor on their permanent role. Because in past most of the new joiners were either absconding them or leaving them within a few months of joining. \r\n\r\n- That is why they are also having a notice period of 90 days from the first day of your joining.\r\n\r\nSo, my one humble request to anyone who is looking forward to joining this organization, please just have some feedback from an employee or vendor who either worked with or currently working with Citibank. If you found someone who is working in the business unit for which you are also got hired then it will be better. Only then take your decision to join this organization."}], [{"review_title": "Not sure", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Mar 2009", "job_title": "Vice President in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunity to work in many functions and great global exposure.

There was never a sense of greater collaboration with the other sites.

There was no sense of a team who wanted to achieve something together, was more like a team of managers trying to push their own agendas.\r\n\r\n - I will say also that due to the sure size of Citi and the many business sections it is divided into, you will feel like a very very small cog in a behemoth of a machine. You will probably specialise in a very small area, where you will tend to do the same repetitive task day in and day out. Flexibility to move across the organisation is possible but for me was restricted. In contrast to this if you worked in a smaller company for example it is likely you would use both front-end and back-end coding stacks. You would probably have a chance to share and implement your ideas instead of obediently following one manager unchallenged.\r\n\r\n- There was nearly nothing that was inspiring working in my team or this organisation.

Employees are almost universally unhappy, save for the paycheck, and there is no management or human resources support when problems arise. Operations at the company work through endless recurring conference calls filled with buzzwords like \"leverage,\" \"use cases,\" and \"workstream,\" but no results are ever achieved and no tasks are actually completed.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size and global spread of the company and the fact that most employees work from home, managers essentially answer to no one, and it's genuinely possible for employees to completely disappear within the system. Human resources are inaccessible -- if they exist at all -- and getting help with something as simple as a desk to work at and a computer that actually works are left completely up to the individual employee to figure out. There is no ability to advance to a higher role or even a different group: once you're planted in a slot, that's where you're expected to be, for years on end if necessary.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience, no matter what interviewers and hiring coordinators say, job descriptions given to potential employees have no actual relationship to what employees are actually expected to do - in large part because managers operate without any sense of strategic direction, and bodies are just thrown at meaningless projects without any sense of reasoning or applicable skills. Regardless of the nature of the work, everything is done in Excel spreadsheets containing meaningless data, and there is no sense of employee loyalty to the company or to one's co-workers.\r\n\r\nEmployees refuse to respond to emails or phone messages, and even when meetings are scheduled, individuals completely ignore them, because there is no management penalty or monitoring. Projects are initiated with no sense of timeline or goals - or even a sense of \"why are we doing this?\" - and frequently discussing the status of projects on conference calls is viewed as a more acceptable substitute than actually getting something done. Individuals frequently ignore deadlines and refuse to collaborate on group projects, because every individual work unit only answers to itself, and upper management has no recourse over individual groups to force results. Meanwhile, even items requiring first-level managers to take the simplest action go completely ignored for months on end - which is actually fine, because no one within the company cares about what others in the company do anyway.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the fact that this sounds like a rant, please, as a human being, I beg you to take this seriously: do not come to work at Citi. I have loved every job I ever took before I began working at Citi, and only agreed to come on board to relocate to another area for family reasons.
