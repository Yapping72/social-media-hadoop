To add insult to injury, 1 month later I received a UPS letter from the manager, not from Human resources or the Area Director, telling me that because of the few days that I was out, even though I had vacation days, I was being terminated because I did not return or report to work, which was a huge lie. I never received an exit interview. This ladies and gentlemen is what and error or a deliberate act on the part of someone behind a computer can do to you. I say this with no malice because it is only the truth. I guess someone had a vendetta. I liked my job and I liked my coworkers even though they were a pain sometimes.

I wouldn't take it back but there are some fatal business faults that this company gets away with due to the monopolistic nature of this department. Innovation, Competition, and Product investment are \"too much cost and effort\" Likely due to Citi commanding complete market share control compared to other banks. The technology stack suffers and is trapped in a Pre-Y2K mindset.\r\n\r\nMASSIVE TECH DEBT. \r\n\r\nWorkforce Labor Relations:\r\n\r\nIf I had a dollar for every gifted mind I met at this company that's talents were squandered I would be rich. This company sets you up for failure bluntly you have to be a strong person to be able to handle the rampant understaffing and soul-crushing lack of morale. The management in my experience is robotic and only worries about their bottom line. When I was on the phones producing 10% of the SLA I was a favorite. The second I became a squeaky wheel revealing the massive technical debt they had I needed to be eliminated. \r\n\r\nGroup cohesion is not cultivated and there is no sense of teamwork. You will get blamed for other departments' problems and people's mistakes. There is a huge throw-them under-the-bus/fall guy mentality. If you use HR that's it your done. IF managers spent half the time they did on cracking down on workers, building team morale and motivation maybe their products wouldn't suffer so greatly. Write-ups are for arbitrary made-up reasons involving 5 min breaks  running their shop like Bezos warehouses, instead of actually getting issues resolved. Stop fighting with your workers do your job and fix the platform.\r\n\r\nAfter you fix 75% of their issues, carrying a dead website so much that the tech teams want to hire you they will use office politics and a general disdain to kill your career. \r\n\r\nCiti employees need to stand up together and reject these toxic relations with management. \r\n\r\nManagement & Outlook:\r\n\r\nIve stated the problems above. If management doesnt get with the times I can't say I have a positive outlook. It seems like no matter what they default back to their same problem state. HIRE PEOPLE.
