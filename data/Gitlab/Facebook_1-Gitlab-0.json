That's far better than the alternative (I've worked at THOSE places, and they suck), but it can get a little silly. \n* While this is true of any business, your work environment will REALLY depend on your manager.

A lot of this company is still based around relationships, so having good relationships with managers who have good relationships and the respect to manage their division will be very important.\n* Mobility is straight up. Very little opportunity to switch orgs, and it's crowded at the top of the IC ladder in most departments.\n* Comp is lower than other tech companies.

They are based on assumptions and they used a poorly made CS software.\n- Transparency is a myth (not like advertised) . People can provide feedback to your management without putting their name on.\n- Employees with more seniority in the company control every aspect of the organization. New hires don't feel part of the team and are judged based on their social skills. Even though if you're based in EMEA you will have to deal with that type of judgment from AMER people.\n- They say you can work from anywhere, but they force you to put your camera on at all times\n- Career opportunities are almost null.

This is not true at GitLab. The pros of working at GitLab almost all tie directly back to the values that GitLab takes very seriously: \r\n\r\nCollaboration: people here are kind, there are all sorts of resources and helpful tips to welcome newcomers and collaborate with the greatest community in the kindest way. Folks share their opinions, say thanks, and give feedback. For challenging collaborative problems, GitLab provides a variety of resources to educate folks on how to navigate the tough bits.\r\n\r\nResults: one of the sub values of \"results\" is \"Measure results not hours\" - and it shows. People are not tracking how often you're \"active\" on slack, how many meetings you make, how many things you say in meetings. Being handbook and async first in an all remote company means that the value of your contributions speaks volumes more than how you \"appear\".\r\n\r\nEfficiency: people for the most part write things down. This is the core of being handbook first. And let me tell you: I can't imagine working any other way. It's a lot of information to parse out. But imagine working somewhere where your coworkers don't interrupt you every 15 minutes to ask the same question someone else asked. Or where you don't feel bad having to interrupt your coworkers with the same thing. You can literally Google internal company processes and get an answer. Not sure how to write a good code review? Google \"GitLab code review process\" and you'll find the handbook page. Want to know how to submit an expense report? Type \"expense reporting GitLab\" in your navigation bar and you've got the answer. It's amazing, and I think it's extremely understated as a benefit here. It gets overshadowed by being all remote. But if you're an information-savvy knowledge worker, this is the way you must demand to get work done.\r\n\r\nDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging: this is where asynchronous communication comes in. And there's explicit instructions about having uncomfortable conversations. The company explicitly talks about what this value means, instead of being an overarching idea that's too broad to be useful. I've never believed a company ever cared about this value until I interviewed at GitLab. The interviewing process is as equitable as it can be (there is still a power differential, of course. And human systems are imperfect, and I have many privileges so I can't necessarily evaluate this objectively). But again, you can google all the hiring details and know what to expect. You can see the statistics in terms of hiring length, hiring metrics, etc. There are some confidential pieces of information here, of course, but the transparency builds to this diversity value. \r\n\r\nIteration: this value can be challenging, but it can also be freeing. I feel empowered to make small, reversible changes all the time. To pitch ideas, deliver on promises, and come back later to clean things up. I'm never blocked because I'm waiting for approval three levels up.\r\n\r\nTransparency: this is another value that lends to the handbook first pro. \r\n\r\nOther pros: \r\n\r\nRemote work is awesome. \r\nIt's clear how you add value to the company. \r\nThe company is clearly growing, and the opportunity is there. \r\nThe brand name is super cool - I am so proud and excited to have it on my resume. \r\nPeople are welcoming, excited, and always thinking of cool new ideas \r\nLots of opportunity to work on new projects, but also a healthy focus on making sure existing solutions are appropriately leveraged and maintained. \r\nAll levels of management are very accessible. \r\nThe compensation is transparent, and more than fair.", "cons": "There is a lot of information out there. It can be very challenging to parse through and find signal versus noise, especially as a newcomer. \r\n\r\nBeing remote is great, but sometimes you miss the in-person relationships and collaboration style. \r\n\r\nThe company is moving at a fast pace. They talk a lot about work/life balance, and they clearly take steps to enforce it. But I personally find myself being highly engaged and thoughtful about work outside of working hours because of all the activity going on. It's exciting, but it can be hard to turn off when your \"office\" is just inside your laptop, and the company is abuzz with activity at all hours of the day. This is a personal problem, not necessarily a systemic one. But I think many people share this. \r\n\r\nThe onboarding process itself is very structured and easy to follow, with plenty of information. But I have spoken with many colleagues who feel like they were thrown into the deep end early on. I think a start up at this phase has a lot of that - the company needs to move quickly, and employees need to be ready for that. Be ready to feel a little lost for the first few months with information overload and a fast pace of work. I think most folks adjust, and GitLab has plenty of resources and systems to help. But it can be a lot, for sure. \r\n\r\nBecause everything is handbook first, everyone is empowered to make decisions, etc., there are plenty of conflicting information sources out there. I think this is true of any company. The challenge at GitLab is that having all the documentation public means that any person in the company might stumble upon two conflicting pieces of information - rather than a different company where those conflicting points of view are siloed to teams. In that specific case, being siloed can actually be useful for individuals."}, {"review_title": "Embracing a remote future", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Channel Marketing Manager in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "GitLab is truly embracing a remote workforce - I can work anywhere, anytime and keep up with my colleagues around the globe.", "cons": "To ensure transparency and the ability to communicate at any time with peers around the globe, there is more documentation than may be ordinarily required at a face-to-face company."}, {"review_title": "a divergence from culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 May 2021", "job_title": "Integration Engineer in Assiniboia, SK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "remote culture and asynch work", "cons": "introduction of many many layers of middle management 'professionals' to fluff head count in preparation for IPO, resulted in dilution and loss of the culture that made the company what it once was."}, {"review_title": "Great company, great product-  god AWFUL sales org.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Sales", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Such a cool product and company with incredible, life changing benefits.

More importantly though, they're kind, thoughtful, and invested in making the company better. I genuinely enjoyed working with the people at GitLab, and met a lot of people I still consider friends after leaving.\r\n\r\nAs far as the job itself, I learned a ton and was never bored. There are a lot of great internal resources and in-house tools that are really helpful in being able to solve problems. And just to be clear, customers bring some really interesting problems. It was really cool to see all the different ways people used (and broke) their installations. Working at GitLab was basically a neverending crash course in how to manage and maintain software, and I mean that in the best way possible.\r\n\r\nThe benefits were probably the best of any company I've worked at. Health insurance was incredibly good, and they covered the majority of my family's costs. They allow people to expense training materials and are pretty liberal with what they will pay for - I've worked at places that have a similar policy but will then fight you on every little thing, and that was never the case at GitLab. Same with their unlimited PTO policy. They trust people to behave like adults, and I can't understand how nice that is.\r\n\r\nGitLab's dedication to process and operations is also a big selling point. I've worked in so many places where no one bothered to document anything, and the fact that GitLab spends so much time and energy on this is great. Their handbook is one of the most thoroughly impressive documents I've ever seen, and for the most part, its actual contents are extremely fair and thoughtful.", "cons": "One major con that I noticed toward the end of my time at GitLab is that it's starting to feel like a big company, which wasn't the case when I started there. It was awesome to see such rapid growth, but in my opinion, they scaled the product and operations without quite getting things like communication right. There were a few instances of really big decisions being made behind closed doors, then being met with a lot of pushback when they were announced. It felt to me like these decisions were made non-transparently because leadership knew they would be unpopular, but it's also likely I don't have the full context. Running a company is hard, and so is communication, and to be clear, GitLab's leadership did things the right way more often than not. There are just a few specific instances that left a really bad taste in my mouth, so that's why I mention it.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem that I have is pay discrepancy via the \"location factor.\" I live in an area with a decent factor, and I felt I was paid fairly for my work - but my coworkers in Latin America, for example, work just as hard as I did for about half as much money in some cases. My main gripe here is that pay difference is explicitly not based on cost of living, but \"market rate.\" This might have made sense when remote-first work wasn't the norm, but it turns out there is a whole \"market\" of companies for me to choose from that don't penalize people for living in the wrong place. So even ignoring my moral judgment on this, it doesn't make sense anymore from a hiring perspective. I won't get into the effects this has on diversity and inclusion, but there's an obvious impact here as well."}, {"review_title": "If you want true asynchronous remote work, this is the place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Full Stack Engineer in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Best remote asynchronous work environment I've seen\r\n- Well organized onboarding\r\n- Work is interesting and my colleagues are a pleasure to work with\r\n- The company actually puts meaningful effort into upholding its values (publicly accessible in the handbook)", "cons": "- Compensation is good but I've gotten better offers elsewhere\r\n- My health benefits were better with my previous employer (a small company)"}, {"review_title": "Awesome adventure", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Senior Backend Engineer in Lisbon, Lisbon District", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture, salary and very talented coworkers.", "cons": "None that I can think of"}, {"review_title": "Evolving, fast growth company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Senior Program Manager in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* Moves fast\n* Good values\n* Great PTO policy", "cons": "* Growing pains\n* Sometimes seems to move too fast"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent place to work due to remote culture, company growth and transparency.", "cons": "Career path is limited in some cases."}, {"review_title": "Security Assurance Engineer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Security Assurance Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Transparency - It's a value that is lived out in a very unique fashion at GitLab with things such as their compensation calculator (you can look up the range for your and others' positions within the company) and the openness of discussions that take place on a daily basis in Slack and GitLab Issues. While it is rare for people to always agree on an approach or change occurring, the openness in which people can share their feelings is a breath of fresh air compared to the backroom and private chats that people normally resort to to discuss their grievances.\nFlexibility - Being all remote is something that more and more company's are moving to or at least a hybrid model but the difference with GitLab is that they are taking it a step further with remote locations AND remote time arrangements. With a company spread out around the world it's inevitable that it's daytime for someone and nighttime for another so there is no expectation of people working the typical hours of their own time zone. It's not uncommon to get messages in various channels throughout the day letting you know that someone is stepping out for a few hours or working a different than usual schedule for a while and the expectation is rarely that you'll be able to immediately get a response on something from a specific person via chat, so everyone builds their work and there days around themselves making for better documentation and greater work/life balance.\nPeople - The people of GitLab are phenomenal. While I haven't worked with everyone and everyone certainly has different backgrounds and approaches to work, people are open to collaboration and even being remote are genuinely caring about each others' lives.\n Remote - Similar (but different) to flexibility, the all remote arrangement of GitLab makes for very cool work arrangements. Want to work from your local coffee shops each day? Great. Want to beat the holiday travel rush home and work there for a week on either side of the holiday to avoid crazy plane tickets? Great. Want to be a digital nomad and hop around country to country in a new place every other week? Awesome. GitLab encourages and enables people to find what works for them and provides the resources to be successful (they'll even buy you a portable monitor so you can travel with it if that's your thing).\nStartup - GitLab is still a startup and while there are companies that are younger and smaller, GitLab is scaling well and is still a startup with how they approach work and through their transparency is doing a good job of avoiding the usual shift from startup to successful business that pushes all the people that made it a great place to work, out. It's also cool to work on a product that feels like it'll change things for a lot of companies, and to watch that happen.", "cons": "Not many but things that can be a challenge:\nLack of availability - since you can't count on people to be online at the same time as you, especially starting out it can be difficult to adjust to a world where you just push everything as far as you can and then set it down compared to a typical environment where you'd have a desk to walk over to or a person to IM that was on the same hours as you and you could message them for an answer so you could keep going on something. As a whole the asynchronous work style is awesome but takes a little adjusting to at first.\nEasy to be always on - With full time remote it becomes very important to set boundaries between work and life but also, with people spread around the world it's inevitable that you'll have some early morning or late night meetings that pop up that you need to attend. While it is rare and often avoided via recording meetings and sharing a collaborative notes doc, there are times when flexing your schedule for some late nights or early mornings is the simplest way to handle a problem and can lead to burnout if you let those type situations trickle over into never truly turning off from work.\nChange - being a startup things are constantly changing and it can be difficult at times to keep up with all the changes and there are adjustments that seem to happen on a far more frequent basis than other more established companies. While not necessarily always a con, there is the potential that some of the things you may hold most dear about the company upon hire quickly adjust to something else and that may be difficult to handle for some. That being said, the core foundations of GitLab don't seem to be changing and this is a risk at any company, it's just more realized at GitLab due to the size/current nature of the company."}, {"review_title": "Best Company To Work For", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 May 2021", "job_title": "Sales Development Representative (SDR) in Kinston, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Unlimited PTO, All team members are aligned with values and are always continually improving.

The salary scaling by cost of labor is also a little odd, but discussed at length elsewhere on the Web (pros and cons)\r\n\r\nOne thing that's unexpected is the shackle of living in a high-COLA market. Normally, one could decide to add an extra 30 minutes to a commute to find more affordable housing, but once you cross the metro area line, you drop into an often dramatically lower bracket: Leaving New York City (90% of SF base) drops you to \"Everywhere else, NY\" (63%). So a lot of moves of financial convenience just aren't worth it, unless you REALLY move somewhere where the floor is so low that the ceiling dropping doesn't matter. If I leave a $200k TC job in Manhattan for $150k at GitLab, the prospect of moving to White Plains where I could possibly afford a house seems doable, until I learn that my salary will now be $105k.

All of GitLab's values and company policies are explained in the \"handbook\", a massive, searchable, publicly-accessible document that anyone can edit.\r\n- Positive work/life balance.  GitLab employees aren't pressured to work overtime and are encouraged to take vacations.\r\n- Generous spending policy.  GitLab will pay for any equipment you need to do your job, and there's no red tape or approval processes.\r\n- Global.  It's a ton of fun to work with people from all over the world.\r\n- High morale.  At the time of writing, there's a lot of interest and investment in GitLab.  Everyone at GitLab feeds off this excitement.\r\n- Salaries are (kind of) transparent.  You can get an idea of what you'll make before you even apply using the interactive salary calculator.\r\n- Clean code base. GitLabbers spend a lot of time making sure GitLab is developed using the best practices.\r\n- Competent leadership.

This included two technical interviews, one for frontend and one for backend.  \r\n\r\nThe technical interviews were very well designed.  They were in the form of a dummy Merge Request, which I received 48 hours in advance.  I had to comment and suggest improvements, just as I would when reviewing a real MR.  Then, I had to do some live coding implementing some of the changes, to prove I knew my way around the code.\r\n\r\nThe interviewers were all kind and punctual.  There were no \"gotcha\" or pointless algorithm questions.\r\n\r\nOverall, a great interview experience.\r\n\r\nWorking there so far is great.  Management and peers are very helpful and respectful, and the massive handbook has the answers to most any basic questions you have about anything.  \r\n\r\nWorking hours and vacation policy is also great  Very few meetings. Very flexible, you are basically expected to get your job done, attend the meetings you are required to, and outside of that you can structure your life however you want.\r\n\r\nMeeting etiquette is also very unique in this completely virtual company.  You are welcome to attend any meeting (and many/most are recorded and published publicly, for future review).  They are very strict and succinct about agendas.  You also are not required to pay attention to everything, even if you are attending.  If it's an hour meeting, and you only have ten minutes that applies to you, you can just keep working while you are on the call the rest of the time.\r\n\r\nThe pay scales are also very transparent and fair.  There are very narrow bands determined by your title, skill level, and location, and there are no exceptions to this.", "cons": "Not really a con, but you must be very organized and disciplined to navigate and thrive in such a documentation-centric and process-driven environment.  I am, so this isn't a con for me.\r\n\r\nThey are also currently going through some scalability and performance issues, which is to be expected during periods of rapid growth.  However, as far as I can tell, they are proactively identifying the issues and actively working on them, which is all you can ask for."}, {"review_title": "Strong values, mature processes", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Jan 2020", "job_title": "Senior Product Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The values listed in the GitLab Handbook are no joke.

Everyone was really friendly, responsive, and inclusive. \r\n\r\nThere is no pressure to keep your 'butt in your seat' unlike at some remote jobs where you're remote, but still expected to be chained to your desk from 9-5. I am able to walk my dog, go run errands, or even just go talk to my family or do laundry in the middle of the day without feeling like I have to constantly justify where I am every second of the day. They care about results, not about how much time you're at your desk. \r\n\r\nThe time off policy is no joke. You don't have to beg for time off.

Just let someone know, make a PTO Ninja event, and you're all set. Amazing. \r\n\r\nIf you're just running out for a bit to get errands done or go somewhere with family/friends, they trust you'll get your work done and you can schedule your day as you see fit. Again, it's about results. Some days you may work 4 hours, some days you may work 10. Flexibility to structure your time how you want is huge. \r\n\r\nYou're surrounded by motivated, driven people.
