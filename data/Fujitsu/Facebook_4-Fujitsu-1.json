Everyone can see your agent score, how often you've been using the toilet and you're constantly pressured to meet at least 95 percent on a scoring system that doesn't reflect at all on how professional you are or how we'll you are serving your customer. It's all based on how fast you can get the call finished and how many insidents you manage to close. (closing certainly does not mean solve) usually means you've managed to fob the user off. Progression isn't necessarily given to someone that will be a positive impact to the company. You'll notice that the ones progressing tend to go to the pub with each other and management tend to pick who they think will be a laugh to join their team. Once you aren't an agent you're in the position where you can pass pass responsibility on others and just smoke cigarettes and fart and pretend to look at emails from time to time. Agents are told to buddy up with other agents who are usually very stressed out and do t really need anyone listening to what they're doing and asking questions because they're stressed enough trying to do the job themselves with poor training. The building and everything in it doesn't get cleaned well and looks like it's never been cleaned at all. Agents have brought this to management so many times and usually get a sarcastic response and everyone is told to clean their desk themselves. Management are allowed to isolate every other week and come into office the other but if you're an agent you have to come in every day. The environment in the building I'm working at isnt prepared and made safe for workers during a pandemic. Equipment is broken or of very poor quality and is usually very disgusting. Most of the time there's someone that isn't even able to sit at a seat because the companys hired too many people and doesn't have enough seats or equipment for them. Agents suffer a lot of abuse from customers each day due to people higher up the chain not caring and forgetting to give crucial information and have awful guidance on how to manage situations. You're expected to refer to a knowledge base for any questions the customer might have or to help solve their issue. The information is quite often wrong though or ot updated and when the customer asks why you are left stressed and cannot tell the truth otherwise you could lose your job.\r\n\r\nThis is my honest experience of the floor I work on and the rest of the building seems a lot nicer and workers are respected more as human being should be.\r\n\r\nMore money needs to be spend and corners need to stop being cut. There needs to be an over all positive and can do attitude and not just reacting to things going wrong at the last second.
