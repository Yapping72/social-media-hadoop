There is a huge weakness in project delivery in the company, projects are rarely delivered in time and on budget. The UK government recently claimed that Fujitsu was on its blacklist as a high risk supplier which is not surprising because the company does not prioritise customer satisfaction. There is no meritocracy at the organisation so it loses good people to its competitors"}, {"review_title": "Outdated mode", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "27 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Member of Research Staff in Sunnyvale, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The lab is still intent to conduct traditional research, and perform technology transfer to business units. The lab's working environment is good: you will be not busy; it is easy to survive as long as Fujitsu is doing well financially. No one will miss his/her yearly goal. In general, if you are looking for somewhere to retire without pressure, this may be the right place for you if the lab isn't closed or restructured dramatically (this is a big IF though).", "cons": "The lab is in a bad situation in general. The budget gets cut every year, partially because Fujitsu's financial status is getting worse, and mainly because the mode that this lab uses is outdated. For example, in the last two years the budget is reduced by 10-15% every year, and this is no hope that it will get better in the near future. \r\nFLA uses the mode that the researchers propose their topics and projects, and develop prototypes, and hopefully convert the prototypes into real products. However there is a big gap between the prototypes and the products, and there is no effort to bridge this gap. Virtually all prototypes are discarded after several-year investment. What's worse, the proposed projects are also outdated when they are first proposed and they related people often fail to realize that. I didn't see any real successful research happened in the last a few years. Hence I can feel the impatience of the Fujitsu\u2019s HQ. \r\nThe people in FLA can be divided into two groups: (1) the senior members or managers whose main job is to monitor (and push) the junior members; these people get paid well although they do not contribute to the technology much; and (2) the very green junior members who just graduated from schools; these people get paid poorly in terms of the silicon valley's standard.  Most of the people in the middle, who are the most productive, left the lab for better job opportunities. \r\nThe lab starts laying off people quite aggressively, e.g. sometime the entire group is laid off except for the group leader. It is not a safe place for retirement any more unless Japan and Fujitsu prosper again. :P"}, {"review_title": "Electrical Engineer", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Large company very focused on innovation, lots of bright engineers with long experience and deep knowledge of their field.

There was no budget reason for the lay off, and an explanation/justification was not provided (to those laid off or to the remaining employees).  If you are looking for stable employment, this is not the place for you. \r\n\r\n- New CEO and SVP are sent from Japan every 3-4 years.  Some of them are great, and some of them are not.   There is no continuity of leadership or research strategy.   How this affects researchers, for example, is that when a new CEO comes in, he may decide that what a particular researcher has been doing over the *past* several years is not valuable and therefore the researcher should not be promoted (even though the researcher may have had no say in what they were working on).  \r\n\r\n- There are also some very bad managers within the labs .  Despite reports to HR and executive management, and many people leaving these managers' groups (and even interrupting their green card application processing to do so), they are not only tolerated but promoted.    Managers really do have all the power here.\r\n\r\n- Researchers want to come to the labs to do research but only some groups do research, while others heavily focus on standards, and still others focus almost exclusively on implementing prototypes.  Make sure you know what you are getting into.\r\n\r\n- A lot of interesting work cannot be conducted in the labs in the US but is instead reserved for the labs in Japan.  Unlike researchers in Japan, local researchers here have to constantly apply for funding and justify and re-justify their approach and their work.  This makes us feel like second-class citizens.\r\n\r\n- Gender diversity within the labs is dismal.  There is currently only 1 woman researcher in Sunnyvale.

Fujitsu's interest is in driving bill rates up and not in providing excellence in delivery. The culture covets the sale and not the delivery of excellence.\r\n\r\nExecutive management is disinterested in leaving their offices to see for themselves what is happening in the field. They rely on the reports of managers who only wish to save their own skin by blaming poor revenue growth on their subordinates. It is interesting that this is accepted by the executive branch.

My experience is that they expect you to do on-call once a month,  do patching and application releases overnight or on weekends (often with only minimal notice) as well as be able to answer the phone when not on-call, just in case.  All the while, expecting you to study for exams to get certifications which you will never use because they are so far behind.\r\nLow pay:  Most of the base pay is below industry standards, most pay rises were about 1% per year, the last 2 years there were no pay rises, and Management justified it because they lost too many contracts.  So the workers end up suffering because the management can't keep the current clients.. \r\nAnnual Leave:  In the past few years, because they are losing money, they started to force people to take annual leave, First it was you have to take 20 days per financial year, then it was that you can't have a balance over 8 at the end of the financial year, the next year, it was down to a balance of 7.\r\nThis cause you to take annual leave mostly in the final month of the financial year (March cause it is a Japanese company) which is also quiet a busy time, which means staff are missing at important time.\r\nRedundancies:  Over the past 4 years, they have been making staff redundancy at regular intervals.  Firstly it was one a year (usually around June/July) but since then, they have been making people redundancy in small lots (1-2 a week) this mean moral is rock bottom, and most staff don't know what is happening when they come to work on a Monday."}, {"review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "26 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very active with making sure that everyone is on board with what they are doing.
