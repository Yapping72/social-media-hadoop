I'm not sure how these ranks could be so oblivious and lacking so much in humility at the same time, when it was obvious for everyone that local management isn't a fit for this project and they're not bringing any value to operations (actually, they are taking value from it be acting as a super effective talent repellent).\r\n\r\nI'm sure these people would be fine handling a call centre... but that's stretching my expectations given the displayed ability.\r\n\r\nMost of these areas reported to external management outside of the GDC based in other countries, but at the same time everyone had this weird grey area in which they were also reporting to this local GDC management that was absolutely clueless as to what was going on. A really weird and frustrating experience.\r\n\r\nNO CAREER OPPORTUNITIES:\r\n\r\nThese business areas are \"new\" in the GDC... you'd imagine that would mean growth, but that's not the case because when you're hired, you're most likely already at or close to the \"top of the food chain\" for your career path, as the GDC does not have further growth for the positions to which they are already hiring for and they won't be available at the GDC (yep, another con they pull at the interviews) you will be stuck doing whatever it is you are doing.\r\n\r\nLOW SALARIES THAT IGNORE BENCHMARKS:\r\n\r\nAs the GDC is used to winning projects by being \"competitively priced\" in call centre operations, they pay people dirt cheap when compared to market rates and continuously ignore market benchmarks.\r\n\r\nThis usually ends up happening because they aren't honest on what roles they are hiring for VS the roles people actually are handling - eventually when people figure out they were conned during the hiring process, they start to move away from the company (I'm aware of cases people moving and getting over \u20ac1000 more PER MONTH than what FJ offers... that should tell you how low they are paying there).\r\n\r\nNO ENCOURAGEMENT, BONUS OR PERFORMANCE AWARDS EVEN WITH SUB-PAR SALARIES:\r\n\r\nAs stated, the GDC is structurally positioned to handle service desk and call centre operations. Any and all bonus/awards schemes focus around that.\r\n\r\nWhat happens as a result, is that you have people handling core business areas that impact the performance of the company at the EMEA level, and they have zero added benefits, in spite of having a completely disproportionate level of responsibility, even when compared to the local management to whom they have to report to.\r\n\r\nThere are no performance bonus, no awards - nothing. We're talking about people whose actions bring millions to the company, they spell the success or failure of products. They handle partnerships with major market players, and they drive the bread and butter of business for the EMEA region. They participate in strategic and tactical decisions for the direction of the company in synergy with people both across the region and the HQ in Japan. They generate new partnerships to drive new revenue streams. And they have nothing. \r\n\r\nAs the GDC structure wasn't designed to support these core business roles, people in such roles are left aside from any bonus schemes as these were designed to cater to KPI's of service desks/call centres. Local management has no idea what an OKR driven business structure looks like.\r\n\r\nIt's an obscenely alien concept for the local management to understand, and they won't have any conversations about it - even though most of the people they \"manage\" in this project have way more responsibility and experience in their hands than this... \"management\". Management made zero attempts to even understand the different nature of this project VS the call centre ops they are used to and simply discard any constructive conversation or feedback - they were actively resistant to hear what their employees had to say.\r\n\r\nSuch management, who mostly serve the purpose of approving holidays have: awards, bonuses, company cars and parking spaces to name a few... Why? The extent of their responsibility is literally to relay to their own managers  what the employees are doing (ex.: we have X number of people in Y project doing Z - note that this \"doing Z\" is based on a very thin understanding of the roles, they have zero understanding of what it is people actually do, they do not follow up on people's tasks nor support them in any way) in the project and approving holidays... they even do a poor job at this. \r\n\r\nAbout the car - I'm not sure why exactly they would have it. Their job literally means they are sitting at their desk the whole day or working remotely. Other positions which require by their nature visiting partners to generate business do not have such a perk, hence the individual is penalised: either they don't do it and hence do an ineffective job, or they do it out of their own pocket for... hence at a loss, as again - there are no incentives or rewards regardless of your productivity or efforts. \r\n\r\nThese managers aren't adding any value to the project, again as stated they are detracting value as they are an extremely poor standard bearer for the project as they continuously misrepresent the support needed locally to the higher C-suite at the GDC, and they do not understand that they are attempting to absorb roles that they are not prepared to support, and that they themselves are not capable, experienced, talented or willing to approach in an effective way.\r\n\r\nLOCAL MANAGEMENT VS EXTERNAL MANAGEMENT (Germany):\r\n\r\nSo I've mentioned a couple of times that people in this project are in a weird grey area... where could I start.\r\n\r\nAll the coaching/training/support is given by the management & colleagues in Germany. This causes a weird situation, because many of them have a bitter taste in their mouths due them losing these positions to cheaper labour in Portugal... so you can see where this is going.\r\n\r\nSome of them are quite supportive and good, others... although having the experience, they don't really care about supporting the staff in Portugal.\r\n\r\nThen, the local management has zero ability and willingness to offer support as well. Again, because they have no idea of what's going on, and zero willingness to understand what's going on - their job is just to report what we do in the GDC (at a very high level...) and approve holidays -that's literally it. \r\nBesides that, they come up with some random power point slides (that in most cases where done by other people) and present them wrapped up in stakeholder meetings, pretending they have even a slight understanding of what is going on with the operation.\r\n\r\nNow the interesting thing is - management in Germany tends to be quite happy with the good work people do in Lisbon, even with all this hardship. But apparently, they can't influence our working conditions, and they are aware that they are constantly losing people because employees in Lisbon have sub-par conditions.\r\n\r\nSo even if you present stellar results, and your ACTUAL MANAGER (the one in Germany) wants to improve your conditions, the GDC does no approve it. Why would these random people whose only contribution to daily ops is to approve holidays, have a say in how much someone should be compensated by their hard work?\r\n\r\nIt's ridiculous.\r\n\r\nBut then again, if the project overall has good results because of all these people... you can be sure managers are rewarded."}, {"review_title": "Good work experience as a starter in IT", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "20 Jul 2022", "job_title": "First Line Technical Support Analyst in Bracknell, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work experience to build career in IT\r\nOptions for internal progressions with different departments", "cons": "Low salary\r\nBusy work environment led by bad management"}, {"review_title": "Average corpo for average people", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jul 2022", "job_title": "IT Department Employee in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, L\u00f3dz", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Well, got exactly what I expected - average salary for average people.", "cons": "Management was just absurd, with seemingly no oversight over the project from higher management"}, {"review_title": "Work at fujitsu", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "4 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work cultural \r\nLatest technology", "cons": "Higher Mangement issues\r\nLower pay scale as per other companies"}, {"review_title": "very good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Technical Support Engineer in Noida", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good salary and facilities provided.", "cons": "no cons found till now."}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Technology Support Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Non toxic environment, co-workers supporting each other, working with cloud technologies", "cons": "Documentation takes too long, they have a specific format that we should follow which is tedious to do."}, {"review_title": "language", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Applications Developer in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing", "cons": "japanese language is every whare in development"}], [{"review_title": "Good company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "8 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Cabo SAD in Noida", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good company to work with", "cons": "Management is not pro active"}, {"review_title": "Don't think twice", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Application Developer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company and work culture, the management is very good and flexible if you have genuine concerns and proof to back it up.", "cons": "Not seen  any cons yet."}, {"review_title": "Good Company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer(Internship)", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The work environment was very enjoyable as they embrace hybrid work.

Just a truly awful company in every sense of the word, lacking in any direction or ambition, zero diversity, full of geriatric lifers and slowly dying - it will certainly be the next Compaq / Nokia / Blockbuster / PanAm / *insert other extinct consumer brand here*. This place is like a backwater you hope you never have to sail up and once you do you\u2019re stuck. \r\n\r\nThis is a VERY dated old fashioned company that has long since had its glory days. Being at Fujitsu is like when you walk around old Olympic Games sites from bygone eras that are just rusting wastelands now and sad reminders of what once was. Fujitsu was maybe once a trendy place to work in the 80s / 90s / early 00s. Now it is just a creaking bureaucracy full of pointless rules and regulations and deskilled workers who stay with the company for the crazy generous benefits (but CRAP pay) and ability to coast / skive / shirk for their entire careers and take zero responsibility or ownership for anything waiting to retire / get culled in the routine reorgs that take place. There is no future for this old tech company and it can\u2019t compete with new tech despite the constant confusing rebranding. \r\n\r\nAnother weird thing for a technology company is that nothing ever seems to get done at Fujitsu yet the company seems to get bigger and more bureaucratic year on year. So many pointless \u201cmanagers\u201d and hoops to jump through to do the most basic things. And Fujitsu \u201cmanagers\u201d is a very generous way to describe these people. Line managers lack basic people management skills and universally lack any leadership qualities. Mediocrity is accepted as normal here and there is no drive to change or push for quality outcomes. Why would anyone would want to start or try to progress their career at somewhere so lacklustre and uninspiring??? Joining this company should come with a disclaimer!!\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely zero career progression at this company too as it is not an aspirational place to work. Most people in Fujitsu have been kicking around for years and are extremely lazy and it ends up rubbing off on you as that\u2019s the company culture - do as little as possible and hope no-one finds out. Another weird thing about this being a technology company is that nothing feels modern at all!!! Even the intranet uses an early 00s interface and don\u2019t even get me started on the rusting and decrepit offices. Just run a Google image search for their Bracknell office - what kind of 20 something recent computer science / software engineering graduate is going to want to work in some Soviet era tower block that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in Kiev?! Answer: no-one! This is not a young person\u2019s company. And definitely NOT a place for smart graduates to go! They go to Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google ; they don\u2019t ruin their careers at have-been hardware companies like Fujitsu\u2026\r\n\r\nWhat is so annoying is how hierarchical and bureaucratic the company is. There is no innovation because you have to go through hundreds of hoops to do anything. Some teams have seemingly never ending reporting lines, I have one current colleague whose reporting line consists of no fewer than EIGHT people. EIGHT people in ONE reporting line. Only at Fujitsu could you have the cast of thousands in a single reporting line - now you see why nothing gets done and the company is losing work! Same thing with internal meetings absolutely EVERYONE has to be involved in every inconsequential decision , customers even point that out to me why are there so many people involved it\u2019s embarrassing. \r\n\r\nThere is also no diversity or representation at all at any level of the company and absolutely NONE in the leadership team. Management love to talk about diversity initiatives but there is nothing concrete happening anywhere. Practically everyone who works here is a white British male in their 50s / 60s. It is extraordinary how NOT diverse this company is, unusually so, almost like they actively tried NOT to hire anyone that isn\u2019t a white British 50+ male. \r\n\r\nDo not come here - you will kill your career. If you are there now, get out it gets harder every year to escape because you're so deskilled."}, {"review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 May 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Team structure & good management", "cons": "No pay hike & limited career growth"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work and would recommend to any one", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "5 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Senior Offering Manager in Solihull, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance is great and plus they do look after you", "cons": "Have to leave to get a pay rise"}, {"review_title": "Good..", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 May 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice company to work for sap peofiles", "cons": "No cons found out yet"}, {"review_title": "On Site Tech", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Onsite Tech in Auckland, Auckland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good database of trainings\r\ngood people\r\nwork from home", "cons": "Toxic\r\npolictics on high levelw\r\ntoo many newbies asking 100 questions"}, {"review_title": "The company you are looking for", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Recruitment Specialist in Taguig", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I just started last month at Fujitsu and I am experiencing a work-life balance! \ud83d\udc96", "cons": "As of now, I do not have any cons to say to this company."}, {"review_title": "Anonymous", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 May 2022", "job_title": "Customer Service Manager (CSM) in Auckland, Auckland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good team culture, flexible working, management team, customers", "cons": "none that i can think of"}], [{"review_title": "Place for younger getting experience.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 May 2022", "job_title": "Equipment Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You'll got chance to learn skills.", "cons": "A place for old man."}, {"review_title": "Don't expect a pay rise", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Service Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Large company with lots of opportunities for development.", "cons": "NO PAY RISES - NOT EVEN TO KEEP UP WITH INFLATION.
