They are being shut down totally.\n\nIBGT which is known to be the worst area of DBS is now slowly ruling C2E. It seems like they have put in a puppet in C2E who is so fearful of others that he simply cannot lead from the front. \n\nPiyush says that the company is agile, it is FAR from that.  Most leaders simply do not even know what agile roles are, what an agile team is and how it must operate. They just quote from some theory and expect that. Earlier leadership in C2E had brought in a great culture and brought in specialists to make this org Agile, but now the new leadership is wiping it all out in the name of cost saving. \n\nPiyush if you still do not open your eyes to reality and get down to the ground level, come to the next level leaders and talk to them then very soon this bank will go back to the stone age."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people who are willing to teach", "cons": "Nothing bad to say about them"}, {"review_title": "Working with DBS", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Wealth Planning Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "welfare and training provided is adequate", "cons": "Nil, not really anything I can think of right now"}, {"review_title": "Great culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "10 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good culture\r\nWell-structured organization\r\nExcellent leadership that has human-centric values", "cons": "Pay may not be up to par with industry\r\nHierarchical"}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Vice President", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good very good very good", "cons": "Not bad not bad not bad"}, {"review_title": "Latest Tech stack", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Vice President in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fast-paced environment for tech enthusiasts/devs", "cons": "NA for cons, may be compensations are not up to MNC standards"}, {"review_title": "Less of a bank Live more", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Senior Associate in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fair compensation, regular team activities.", "cons": "Nothing comes to mind at this moment."}], [{"review_title": "A", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Corporate Sales Manager in Queenstown Estate,", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management is good and supportive", "cons": "Salary and benefit must be more competitive"}, {"review_title": "overall satisfied", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "13 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Investment Banking Analyst in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "everyone is quite friendly and engaging", "cons": "however the working hours varies"}, {"review_title": "Employee review", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Aug 2022", "job_title": "AVP-Project Manager in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can learn new technologies by doing stretch projects", "cons": "Worst work life balance, bossism"}, {"review_title": "Normal", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "12 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Relationship Manager in Bedok New Town,", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Ok salary and nice office", "cons": "No work life balance and bad management"}, {"review_title": "Family culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Research Analyst in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good work life benefits, decent benefits, many days off", "cons": "salary not on par with work intensity"}, {"review_title": "Good culture.

Eg. in sprint 1, the goal was to get Model A working. But at the end of sprint 1, Management suddenly expects Model A, B, and C to work.\r\n- Upper management expects developers to make up for their poor planning and management skills in the form of working on Sundays and Saturdays till 2 am.\r\n\r\nResult: Engineers are overworked, underappreciated and management only provides lip service with no compensation. (And yes, we have worked Sat and Sundays for 3 weeks in a row).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Poor pay, Politics, and lies. Pay is not adjusted to the market rate. Despite getting external concrete offers, management lied about trying to increase the pay rate to match. Management only provides lip service without even actually speaking with HR etc. They provide excuses like not having enough budget, then immediately hire 2 -3 more junior engineers whom I have to train and are less qualified but with a better salaray?!\r\nUpper management only rewards those who talk and demand a lot, not those who actually do the work.\r\n\r\nResults: creates a lot of distrust between employees and management. Causes a lot of fiction and distrust between colleagues as everyone is fighting to be heard. Also encourages solo work to be done than collaborative work.\r\n\r\n3. Upper management hires managers that are unskilled in terms of soft skills and hard skills. This causes a lot of issues between upper management, middle management, and developers.\r\n\r\n- Middle management would present things and deadlines to upper management with no regard for developers.

Not because you have problem with time management, it is mainly because of understaff, meeting schedule too packed, more work piling up everyday, and work delay due to data source issues.\n2. Long working hour because of workload too much and need to spend extra hours to do all the unnecessary trouble shooting thanks to the poor data migration process.\n3. No work life balance. Not only you, your boss and your colleagues are all insanely hardworking. It's normal to work until 3-4am during Weekday. You thought you can take a break during Weekends, Annual Leave and Sick Leave? No way! You are entitled with 24days annual leave, but believe me, you will never use it for leisure purposes.\n4. Nobody will care about your mental health and physical health. All they care is 'donation' and support 'volunteering' work outside of the company. So that branding can be promoted. \n5. High expectation from management and bosses, your works will never be appreciated.\n6. Employee Turn-Over Rate is increasing. More and more people are leaving the company, at least 2-3 people you know will be leaving every month.\n7. Meeting cultures are bad and some meetings are useless. You will spend one whole day to attend meeting, because most of the meetings last for at least 1hour,and some meetings are only 10% relevant to you or for your update/knowledge sharing only.\n8. No time to do all those free courses, no time to do team bonding, no time to do small talk with your colleagues.\n9. Bad planning and a lot of old problems need to clear. Some items have been pending for years or months, but nobody do it until you take the ownership.\n10. People are not very helpful because they are too busy with their own work and clearing backlog. When you need help, the only way is to ping the person multiple times or escalate through emails cc his/her boss."}, {"review_title": "Interview", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Senior Associate in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good bosses and digitalisation efforts", "cons": "Pay might not be high"}], [{"review_title": "Ok but going downhill", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Wealth Planning Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "very large brand and good reputation", "cons": "long working hours\r\nterrible upper management"}, {"review_title": "Manager", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Employee benefits is good a", "cons": "Long hours and lack of internal career opportunities"}, {"review_title": "Good place to retire", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay.
