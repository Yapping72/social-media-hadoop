When I got there, I was not given the salary bump of the job I was hired to do (higher PSG) and given a bunch of bad excuses after I got there and didn't get my pay bump. It put a bad taste in my mouth. In 2021 I decided I needed to leave, I was stuck in a rut where I didn't want to be and wasn't able to grow. Fortunately, they were restructuring after COVID and I was offered a severance package to leave. (I was planning on leaving anyway) So I hung on almost 6 months until I got the severance check. In my opinion you will be discriminated against if you are a white male. It is not blatantly obvious, but there is such a push for more diversity that it became more obvious as time went on. I suspect there will be a lawsuit in the near future. (if there is not already) During the company restructuring in 2021 they tracked what races were being let go because they did not want to let to many minorities go. Minorities were kept even if they were low performers. I bought it up in a meeting that race should not be considered, and that it was illegal to make decisions based on race. The response I got was they were only tracking it because they did not want to make decisions based on an unconscious bias.

When I first started there my Chevron Rep was really cool, great person, very easy to get along with and reasonable, he understood the job that I did and cared to make my job safer. Last year, 2020, the refinery changed up all of the management people I dealt with and gave us some new people and some people who should've been let go but instead were promoted. It seemed like these people in charge made it their mission to make simple tasks into very unnecessarily difficult and unsafe tasks. These managers did not care to listen to the input of the people that had years of experience actually doing the work. I can probably give you an example for each day that I worked there of a more efficient and safer way to do the task. When I would bring it up to this new management team their response was always \"Just do what I say\". It is a damn shame that the refinery management continues to let Angel Gonzalez do what he wants with the contractors he is involved with\n Angel has lied, harassed and bullied so many employees and contractors and Chevron management continues to allow him to do as he likes.
