(Chevron Way) Chevron ITC supplies business-enabling and utility IT services to the greater organization. The environment is diverse in terms of age, experience, geographical location, which I view as a strength. There is a reason you will find many long-term employees here, and while some have posted this as a negative, the more astute will recognize it for the mentoring and networking opportunity that awaits your individual initiative. Your move, unless you want to leave it on the table. That being said this is a young to middle-age workforce given that ITC is a technology business unit. Compensation is decent, autonomy is good, and for those pro-active, self-starters there is great opportunity for recognition and advancement.", "cons": "ITC is a service provider, a cost center not a revenue generator. There will always be cost pressures from the organization to do things cheaper than external competitors, despite the fact that ITC must meet the same level of organizational requirements, rigor,  and overhead as OPCOs on the Upstream side. The impact of this appears to be a never-ending cycle of re-orgs spaced every 4 years where you post for your job and additional backup positions. While it's a part of life no matter where you work, the latest re-org appears to have taken a toll with many asking to be let go, and the remaining feeling the effects of lower morale. Upper management so far has failed to quantify the impacts of these re-orgs on the productivity, innovation, and overall operational excellence within the greater organization. \r\n\r\nThose applying for low-level jobs should be mindful of any utility IT job that can easily be transitioned to a lower-cost geography. \r\n\r\nMost people hold roles from 18 months to 3 years before moving to a different position. This is great for the individual, but bad for teams when lead by a manager or team lead that clearly has no business managing people. On the positive side most not cut out for management realize this, and seek out new roles.

In my experience they seem to be very nosy and overly micro managing of everything.  I'm told the office life is even worse. Also, the level of paperwork and additional requirements for the job has grown tremendously over the last few years which is  having an impact on work life balance and employee health concerns.  The employee wellness program seems to be more for those in the office on the 9/80 schedule and they don't seem to care about their field workers health and wellness as much.  Pay could be more competitive with its peers as Chevron is probably the lowest paying among the majors.  At least they have more of a heart when it comes to holding onto people when times get slow. Health insurance could be better and their employee ranking system leaves a lot of employees disgruntled or upset with their level of reward. It is probably the most complained about subject by everyone.  They lose a lot of good problem solvers and troubleshooters who would make great employees however the ranking system recognizes more special projects or cost savings individuals even though they may not be the most well equipped for their position. They do a lot of things that don't make practical sense and pay for training that has nothing to do with job tasks, roles, and responsibilities.  They seem to be more concerned with public image than making practical decisions that would save costs and time elsewhere. This is probably what leads to the heavy micro managing of field operations and they are likely fearful of ending up like BP. The gap of pay between field engineers and field personnel is ridiculous.  When a field engineer is making 40k more than another individual fulfilling the same roles and responsibilities you have to question the companies fairness and pay with equivalent experience. Also, there is no explanation for why a night DSM should be making more than the lead on the very same rig.

Then another 6 month roadblock trying to get a contract signed to keep company information confidential. Our own standards don\u2019t allow us to keep up with any industry leading programs. Instead we have our IT group create programs, which don\u2019t take the input to a program from the groups that will use it. Then they don\u2019t keep it updated. \n\nEveryone at the refineries talks about how the \u201cChevron Way\u201d is being nice to everyone and not holding people accountable and just scraping by, but no one does anything about it. A lot of people just going with the flow instead of pioneering new models and trying to improve the whole concept. Is that because we have a pension and good pay so people just want to stay around? Sounds like a broken business plan. \n\nNo one keeps track of any money. We have contractors sending in extra work that wasn\u2019t in scope and they\u2019re being paid for it. Because we don\u2019t track anything. Contracts are written on time and material because we don\u2019t want to do the CMCO process. Because we don\u2019t know what is right versus wrong. We\u2019re lazy so time and material is easier. A contractors dream come true. They finish jobs and submit them with 20% markup on both. A welder failed and had to gouge his welds out on Thursday and Friday? We\u2019ll pay him double time to come in Saturday to fix his rejected work. We literally have no idea how to manage contractors and we let  slide by every year. \n\nThere are plenty of PSG-22/23s that are Team Leads and second level managers that have no idea how to manage. This is something that seriously needs fixed. How can the future leaders be bred when they\u2019re lead by poor individuals? The future of Chevron depends on the internal growth of upcoming employees. Proper leadership trainings needs to happen to the 22/23s. \n\nThe annual review process needs tweaking. The ranks are 3, 2- , 2 , 2+ and 1. 1s being the stellar ones and 3 being the turds. The issue is someone who is on the boarder almost a 2- and someone on the boarder of 2+ are both grouped as 2s. While in actual performance they are far from each other. Why do we not use 1-10? Would make so much more sense. I think the current system would be fine if there was more incentive to have employees perform at higher levels.

The ranking system takes your performance evaluation into account and gives you a score to determine your next year's salary. This ranking and performance evaluation is not standard across the company or even the business unit. You are always in the hands of your higher management and they will throw you under the bus when a scapegoat is needed for any reason. You may accomplish everything they put into your performance agreement in the beginning of the year and more; help other employees, work groups, managers, but it doesn't get recognized especially if your manager or some other managers you worked with talk adversely of you.\r\n- Constant comparative environment which promotes individualism, but not teamwork. They continuously race and compare you to the similar salary grade coworkers. They treat you like a race horse year after year. \r\n- No good structural organization system has been in place for years knowing the ups and downs of the oil price effects on economics. The moment oil prices dip, this company is ready to lay off their employees immediately. \r\n- All the company cares for is their stock prices. In order not to sacrifice stock prices, they will sacrifice employees at any time. Makes you feel very worthless and not valued whatsoever. Meanwhile, I've seen so many processes rolled out and have been taken out in a few years or less because they never were fit for purpose. They were just time-wasters for everyone while the company tried to look good outside. \r\n- There is an overload of meetings. If you do not setup meetings, you are not perceived as working although you are actually self-sufficient and know how to plan, manage your time, work along with your coworkers' work. The meetings in this company is a waste of time 99% of the time. Moreover, you have to listen to the same safety briefings over and over and over. \r\n- When you do your work, it is always for the upper management. Your supervisor takes the credit. Your supervisor requests the work that is asked from the upper management.  You do all the work and the supervisor presents the work and receives the credit. \r\n- I've seen lead engineers make up numbers to save their backs in reporting to the upper management. This is 100% unethical, but the rest of the team won't say anything in fear of losing their jobs. \r\n- They non-stop talk about Chevron ways, transparency, teamwork.  They don't follow none of which. \r\n- As a result of all of these cons, I've never seen so many professionals leave Chevron on their own including myself for the last 3 years. Especially after the so-called reorganization that was done at the end of 2017, they kept lower salary grade people whom had been completely miserable at the assignments and working situations they were placed at."}, {"review_title": "Chevron Stations is one of the worst places to work.

Thus, management at Chevron have low intelligence.\r\n- Management don't care about their job.\r\n- Salary is low from start to finish. You start making at exactly minimum wage, and increase by .25 cents every year, and capping to at most 1 or 2 dollars more than the minimum wage.\r\n- If you are a hard coworker management and corporate will just make you do all of the work there while the others are allowed to slack off. So basically, you work while the others get paid the same to do nothing. So, in the end why work well at all?\r\n- In Oregon you have to pump gas. If you can pump gas well and fast, you be made to pump gas forever. Its harder work than working inside the store. Practically no one likes pumping gas, so you will have like 6 people working and 5 people inside the store talking to each other while you have to pump gas alone outside handling all of the gas pumps.\r\n- Management are huge slackers. I had one who just stayed inside the office and was on their cell phone all day.\r\n- Management will talk to you and get angry at you if you get a customer complaint, but will completely ignore customer complaints about themselves.\r\n- Corporate doesn't care about you, even if they say they do. Your just a pile of replaceable trash to them. They will easily replace you with some guy who's desperate for a job if you don't like your job.\r\n- Benefits are a scam. They never give tuition reimbursement to anyone who works at Chevron Stations. I never got it, and no one that I've heard that applied to it has ever gotten it. They don't even give a reason as to why you didn't get it. They just don't want to give you money for tuition. So if your planning to work at Chevron for the tuition reimbursement, I suggest you look elsewhere at a different company.\r\n- No tips by the way. If you get a tip and accept it you will get in trouble. But if management gets a tip they will take it and tell you to back off if you say something.\r\n- Your salary is still low if you become management.\r\n- Management can't do math, can't read, and can't write. I had a manager who asked me how to spell out a basic word that is learned in like 2nd or 3rd grade. They couldn't even write a paragraph, and had to use a calculator for basic math.\r\n- You may get split days off if your not a favorite of management, and you will also get your schedule changed in less than 24 hours if your not a favorite of management.\r\n- Management hires anyone who is willing to work. So the level of your coworkers may vary from people who are difficult to work with, and with huge slackers. \r\n\r\n\r\nI started off as someone who worked hard and well at Chevron Stations trying to actually get work done and well.  In the end I ended up no caring because I was working while the others were allowed to slack off. Plus, I had a minimum wage salary.
