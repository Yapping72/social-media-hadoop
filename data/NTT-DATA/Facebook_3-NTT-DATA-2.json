Charlotte office HR operates totally different and completely against most things you read about the assignment process."}, {"review_title": "great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Senior Project Manager in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great company to work at", "cons": "It is a good place to work at"}, {"review_title": "Good place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Field Tech Senior Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management is supportive and understanding", "cons": "Not always forthcoming about what is being planned"}, {"review_title": "As much", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Desktop Support Management in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Job security is good here", "cons": "Hike and carrier growth is not there"}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good management, employee friendly, work life balance", "cons": "HR polices are not good"}, {"review_title": "Nice to place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Talent Acquisition in Noida", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Over 3 years, I found it great to work and grow.", "cons": "nothing as of now for cons."}, {"review_title": "Good Company to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "26 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Data Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work-life balance and freedom to choose the work", "cons": "Salaries are not up to the industry standards"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best company in the industry", "cons": "Job rotating policies are not quite good enough"}, {"review_title": "okayish company with average growth", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Data Engineer in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "okayish company with average growth", "cons": "less pay , average management , no exposure to new tech"}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Senior Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary , everything is fixed", "cons": "Nothing as such its a great company"}], [{"review_title": "Srategic sourcing", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "big client\nglobal exposure prospects\ngood for start", "cons": "inexperienced leadership\nlack skills so they dont take risk"}, {"review_title": "Friendly environment -NTTDATA Canada", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Project/Task Manager in Halifax, NS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly environment and supportive team and management", "cons": "do not pay high salary , no bonus/incentive \ncareer wise no career improvement for the long run"}, {"review_title": "It depends on project", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Dec 2021", "job_title": "S S E(Senior Software Engineer) in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "No much work\nNo latest technology", "cons": "No good technology\nNo good hike\nNo work life balance"}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Manager in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everything is great here for sure", "cons": "Nothing is that bad here, wonderful team"}, {"review_title": "Wintel & SQL", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "7 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Senior Systems Administrator in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not so strict with rules & leave policies\nEmployee benefits", "cons": "Slow growth compared to IT industry standards\nLess Hikes/promotions yearly"}, {"review_title": "Company environment not same as Dell", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Beaver Dam, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible schedule, allowed work from home after tenure.", "cons": "Non stop phone calls.
