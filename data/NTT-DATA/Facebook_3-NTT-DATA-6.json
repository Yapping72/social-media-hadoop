NTT is actually one of the largest telecom companies in the world, and it feels like that immediately. I would very much recommend to anyone that wants to retain some part of their individuality, or wants to work for a consulting firm...RUN, do not walk, out of the door. This really isn't what you're looking for. \r\n\r\nNTT changed the game by turning our very successful high-end consulting firm into a \"lowest common denominator\" staff augmentation firm. What's worse is that now as a consultant, NTT expects you to find your own project to go to while you are expected to work full-time on a current project. Oh, and you'll get several days of bench time to MAYBE a week in between projects.\r\n\r\nNTT is not great for families in the Charlotte area because their business model is a high-turn over numbers game where efficiency is a dirty word and bureaucratic style red-tape will make you think you are working for the DMV.\r\n\r\nCompared to peers, our salaries were lowered. People were pushed out. Now instead of walking to the IT Department, I have to call the IT Department in India, who then create a ticket, and eventually re-route it to the Charlotte office up to 5 business days later.\r\n\r\nIt's a wonder to me that so many smart people create such stupid procedures/policies. If you'd like to be a part of a stifling, high-turnover, and exhausting workplace, this is for you. Otherwise, I'd recommend looking a little harder at some of NTT's competitors because I can assure you that's where the vast majority of current NTT employees are looking as well.\r\n\r\nFinal advice: Don't get caught up in all the nice words. NTT is about as soulless as they come.

Managers pick their favorite pets who are \"so called\" good performers, when all they're doing is forging work and throwing stuff up in the ceiling hoping stuff sticks and gets over looked. They don't do much for employee appreciation other they give away mediocre gift cards if you're lucky enough to have your name drawn out of the jar. They don't hire a proper cleaning staff to clean the break room and expect the employees to take turns cleaning. They never do anything for employee appreciation and could care less if the morale goes stale. People walk around like zombies and lifeless cause they know it's a matter of time before they get cut. They claim they get new projects and hardly ever do, at least anything note worthy to guarantee you a job and keep you from getting cut and put on the street. Instead of transferring their experienced folks internally, they hire new employees to fill in those roles possibly leaving you on the street if you're not a favorite of theirs.

I worked for NTT via acquisition, and there was no clear communication on culture. Our attrition level post-acquisition wasn\u2019t just bad - it was abysmal. People left in droves. It was one of the worst acquisition experiences I think I possibly could have had. Our benefits constantly changed, our pay cycle changed at least 3 times in 2 years, and our bonuses became non-existent.\r\n2. Pay gap and gender: I can speak to my personal experience here, as I found out that a colleague of the opposite gender made nearly $20k more than I did, and he reported to me. I pushed for a pay raise and received $3500. That\u2019s a far cry from the $20k gap, and it felt like hush money. Industry wise, I knew I could push for a larger salary - something I had NEVER focused on before, because all I cared about before was being connected to my work and being happy - but the NTT culture was so bad that I changed my focus to money more. I felt completely under valued, in every sense of the term. The pay gap here is at least 20% lower than other consulting industry competitors. I was told what a great asset I was to the company, but wasn\u2019t paid accordingly.\r\n3. While on maternity leave, NTT attempted to dishonor the pay that was promised to me. I was promised 8 weeks of short term disability in writing prior to my leave, and 4 weeks into my leave was told I would only get 6 weeks. I spent hours and hours of my personal time (when I should have been focusing on my newborn) trying to resolve the issue, and fought to be paid what I was promised. I did not get paid what I was promised. I was offered additional \u201cPTO days\u201d to attempt to resolve my frustration with a lack of paycheck, and given a fraction of the remaining balance - it was absolutely absurd and unethical. I resigned soon after I received a fraction of the remaining payment. It didn\u2019t matter if I had a new job or not - no one should be subjected to that treatment.\r\n\r\nI will never recommend working at NTT DATA to anyone I know. Yes, I still admire some of my coworkers who choose to work there, but I chose to leave because of a number of reasons. The way I was treated during my medical leave was absolutely wrong.

This is absolutely the worst place I have ever worked.  I suspect the overall rotten atmosphere is caused by the origins of the company.  That is, NTT Data in Japan, the parent company, decided it wanted to be a major player in the global IT market.  To do so, it had to become active in the US market.  Consequently, it went on a buying spree in the US purchasing several US companies of various sizes and cultures.  Initially, each acquisition was allowed to function more or less autonomously.  But then one day, all were thrown together into a single unified company.  The cultures of the individual companies were destroyed overnight and were replaced by an uncaring, pass the buck culture.  Operationally, employee support processes ceased to work.  It was a mess and it has not improved much over the course of 2-3 years.  In short, this company is less than the sum of its parts which is a reflection on upper management and is truly sad", "cons": "- Be sure to ask the recruiters about the bench policy!  (I doubt they volunteer this.  It applies to everyone, even salaried employees.)  Basically, if you're hired for a project that ends, you have approximately 2 weeks to be assigned to a new project or you will be placed on unpaid leave for a while; forced to draw down any vacation; and eventually be terminated after only a very few weeks.  I suspect this policy is a product of the body shop mentality of the company. \r\n- If you resign from NTT Data, they will not pay out accrued vacation.  This says a lot about their approach to employees.  That is, employees are a cost to be minimized as opposed to a resource to cultivate.\r\n- The company seems to be successful at talking over IT operations of clients; sending much of the work offshore as they replace the former US employees; and then keeping the operations running.  On the other hand, the company appears totally incapable of successfully running projects that have to come up with something new such as a custom application for a client.  The project management is terrible.  \r\n- Once projects get into trouble, employees are urged to work untold hours with empty promises of \"We'll make this up to you later.\"  Also, executives may show up to try to find solutions to the problems but the executives speak only to project managers.  They do not ask those in the trenches about problems.  I know of several projects that were essentially abandoned after 1-2 years of effort being expended with little or no results.  What is worse, NTT managers fail to even attempt to learn from their mistakes.  They just move on to another project and commit the same mistakes.  (Prospective clients: BEWARE! )\r\n- Support for many H/R issues and operational items (time sheet management, PTO balance maintenance, etc) is done offshore..  The offshore support staff is consistently missing in action,  It can take weeks or even months to resolve the simplest of issues.  Onshore management does not appear to be able to improve the situation and appear resigned to tolerating it.  Onshore management has literally said \"That's just the way it is,  We have no influence over these people.\"\r\n- The company pretends to be a employee friendly.  By this I mean there are always two policies - the stated policy and the real policy.  For example, the company loves to talk about the importance of employee career planning and the importance of the annual appraisal process.  This stated but essentially fictitious process/policy has major flaws   First, the items employees list in a so-called career plan will almost certainly be ignored.  The appraisal process is pretty much a joke.  While it might play a minor role in determining the meager raise, it is on all other counts meaningless.  Managers seem more inclined to treat these processes as annoyances to get out of the way as quickly as possible with as little real thought as possible.

I've had coworkers lose 20+ hours of overtime for simply taking an hour's sick leave to make a doctor appointment.\r\n\r\nHealth care is abysmal since the company dumped employees on an ACA type plan last year.  Prescriptions that used to cost $20 now cost $400 to $500.  Doctors office visits that used to be $25 are now $100 to $150.  Plan members are forced against their will to use CVS Caremark rather than select their own pharmacy; CVS requires mail order deliver of most prescriptions, which often end up in neighbors' mailboxes or don't show up at all.  Prescriptions that have been pre-approved for years are suddenly denied as no longer being \"on formularly\".\r\n\r\nKnown errors in both the old (pre-SAP) and new (SAP) pay systems have caused incorrect paychecks for most of the dozen NTT contractors in my group.

There is a culture of backstabbing, finger pointing, blaming other towers, blaming other peoples equipment, and including people's managers on every email, in other words, I'm tattling on you because you've been bad. It's a childish way of intimidating others.\r\n4. Engineers are put onto projects where abusive clients treat them like crap and work them to death. Eventually they burn out and we've lost the majority of the good people due the all of the above.\r\n5. Black hole email inboxes, nobody wants to work, they just collect a paycheck.\r\n6. All teams are at war with each other and there is constant animosity and fighting as nobody wants to work with other teams. It's protect our own and screw everyone else.\r\n7. The company is top heavy, so much middle management it's becoming like IBM!!\r\n8. There are hundreds of useless managers and PM's. They never have layoffs but they need them to get rid of the worthless Legacy Perot incompetent people. \r\nIt's a huge buddy system of hiring your incompetent buddy from 20 years ago.\r\nThe most skilled and talented people have already left.\r\n9. NTT Data Services hires project managers that have NO IT experience. You'll be placed under a PM who is clueless as to what you're supposed to do. But the result is panic, micromanagement, pestering, badgering and annoying behavior from PMs who shouldn't even have a job, they are worthless.\r\n10. Disorganization is supreme, there are multiple competing departments.\r\n11. Re-orgs every 6 months. The VPs here add no value, they don't know how to do anything but re-org. The re-orgs don't make sense, what was wrong with the re-org you did 6 months ago? Did you not know what you were doing at that time either?\r\n12. Good luck taking YOUR vacation and spending time with your family, time you have earned. I have seen many people miss out on vacation year after year. I have missed out as well because I was stuck on a project with no backup. I was told I could not leave unless I had someone to replace me.

The pay and benefits are honestly also still just ok. Especially as an IT Analyst in the Austin market tends to make about $5k more than I was at minimum with a few years experience.\r\n\r\nThis is a big part of the issue with this organization because this contract in particular always felt like it was ignored by the corporate branch and treated as a money sink. It was the company's first government contract, and its clear some concessions were made to get it that aren't good for quality of life of the workers on site, as yearly there would be large scale layoffs to lower salary caps, corporate would decline conversion of employees, or requested pay increases when the employee took on new roles and the salary was approved and recommended by their management. There is also only yearly bonuses for higher department management, inclining them to at the end of the year buckle down on their lower employees to cut costs and ensure their bonuses..\r\n\r\nThis environment also leads to a lot of issues with communication and working together between departments. Frequently other departments will not read or acknowledge contacts from people they don't know and departments they aren't in. Many that do acknowledge them still talk down to them and then down't provide real help besides \"we don't do that in our department\" and as such the issue still stands. Some departments that are critical to priority issues are frequently unable to be reached when necessary, and management never would crack down on this, leading to the group holding the ticket and needing to reach them to be holding the bag on an ticket they can't move forward on due to lack of assistance. \r\n\r\nAlso there is an odd amount of leniency on policy and attendance violations that feels unfair and imbalanced. I know everyone's life and job position is different, and as I wasn't management I won't claim to have knowledge in these situations. However, I can say a member of my team always was less productive than the rest of our team, frequently mishandled priority issues, generally would misunderstand management instruction, would leave his desk at random times and not adhere to scheduling that he was needed for, and was taken off a mandatory rotation for the rest of the department, and yet never seemed to be in danger of losing his position or even moved to a different role. I generally liked the person, so I don't wish ill on him or unemployment, however, it is cases like his where it never quite felt like management took issues with all employees seriously and on the same level."}, {"review_title": "No Restrictions in timings", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Peaceful place to work\r\nWork life balance is Good\r\nPeople are friendly\r\nHierarchy is less so you can be easily identified\r\nNegative things about us are said in a polite way.", "cons": "Salary hike is not there that is the drawback\r\nNo any kind of encouragement\r\nNo much development projects are there\r\nEventhough employees are less salary hike is not there\r\nNot a good place to start a career"}, {"review_title": "Not sure what it wants to be ...", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "10 Sept 2019", "job_title": "Vice President in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some very capable staff especially the on-shored India managers.", "cons": "A mess of acquisitions, internal rivalries, cliques and diverging strategies.

It sucks working in a night shift, commuting all by yourself. \r\n* Egoistic management - They supersede organizational policies and pass orders as if they are the one rolling the ball. For example, with unspoken work from home policy prevalent in company, they can ruin the party with a simple email instructing their employees to be regular to office else face the music. Imagine this in a 24x7 environment you are bound to serve in office just to satisfy the ego of your maniac boss who finds sadistic pleasure in finding his subordinates dancing to his tunes. Forget if you have to take an afternoon call, just be there in the office irrespective of what professional work you do outside of it. Such micro-managing ego has led to departure of several key talents. \r\n*Leaves - WTF are leaves? Forget them if you want them when you need them. \r\n*Appraisals are below average. I heard of a person who got 12% appraisal and went mad due to sheer joy. Poor fella.  \r\n* Work life balance - non existing! Especially with diktat in my case, it has made things harder. Rather than focussing on things that matter (work and KRA) they are interested in how long do I stay in office. Stupid desi MBA fads. Ironically, at the same times, women in this company are like SC/ST in a government entrance exam. They don't work (nobody cares, they are rather glad when they join the official call), don't need to commute (duh because they are women, you misogynist!), enjoy privileges which men can't even lust about, let alone dream. Ladies, this is the company you've been looking for. Your search ends here. Go ahead delete your Naukri profile. \r\n*The oomph of working for a brand like Dell is no more. Nobody knows NTT nor seems interested in knowing about it. Glad I got married before that. \r\n*My salary in start was delayed for reasons that would make a small 3 person company laugh like anything. Not for 1 month, 2 months but a whole 4 months. And they give you first salary via Demand Draft. Beat that for bummers. \r\n*No onsite - last time I heard someone went onsite, was when I was sitting across the table with HR asking them how good this company is to join and work, during the HR discussion round. \r\n*Dumb location - It is pure wilderness. Earlier location at 125 was awesome, amazing campus and awesome memories. But that was on a lease which got expired and now we are left with a cocoon called Sec 144 Business Park, which starts and ends at nowhere. No pizza/food delivery options. God forbid if they run out of food and you're starving. They have a building in the name of infrastructure and nothing else. 6 companies in one small park - you don't even feel like venturing out after dinner/lunch. \r\n*Paid Shuttle - They charge you for arranging a shuttle from your nearest metro station. Not just any charge but handsome - Rs 3000/month. Go figure the joke in it. For dead night shifters, or general day shifts - pay n get it. No mercy so what if you commute from high heavens or deep hell. \r\n*Unbearable user interfaces - The official portal is useless at best. The design is 2011, functionality gives complex to 2009 era sites. I have worked at so called desi companies with far more professional looking and excellent designs/navs. And here we have world leader in data management unwilling to pay their UX designers. \r\n*HR-Some HRs are so good at making Rangolis, they can give Neeta Lulla some suicidal thoughts for a moment. Just ask them to do something that will help your cause and see them disappearing like a rat in the farmhouse. \r\n*Manual Labour - I swear on the day of joining, they made me sign 70 pages worth of declarations of all sorts. I was so fed up of signing them, I once thought of jumping down the window from 3rd floor and run away. The world leader in data management and automation requires you to sign till your neurotic response gives up and you end up paraplegic.

Make it almost impossible to get hired if you are U.S. based and apply externally or referred.  They purposefully ask ridiculous technical questions to trip you up in the Interview.  They make it blatantly obvious that their bottom line means they are seeking to have all  IT and Security jobs moved overseas.  Even if you have been working in the industry for years and know the equipment, your answers would not be considered as right.  If you ask the hiring manager why the answer could be wrong, they state it is inaccurate (even though it is in our written procedures).  If by some chance you are hired then they refuse to give you any responsibilities except U.S. government work even if the contract is a U.S. based company.  Day shift U.S. Security Engineers are called on continuously to fix errors by India personnel.  No real accountability or  check and balance system for them hosing things up on Changes.  I thought that moving U.S. A. Security Servers overseas to Asia/India or Mexico would be a clear violation of our privacy and security laws in the United States?  Not to forget that it puts us more at risk for hacking attacks due to our security encryption requirements are more stringent than most third world countries.  Its is the Corporations (like Dell and NTT Data) who move Security Services overseas that purposefully open themselves up to attack. Then refuse to correct their mistakes by properly hardening their networks, or better yet keeping secure servers and their responsibilities stateside.
