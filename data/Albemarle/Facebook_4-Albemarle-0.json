EVERYONE that has the word Director in their title will act like your boss. If you don't do what they ask, the will CC about 10 people in an email so you can see how serious they are. Too many outside vendors for things that could be done in house. The amount of money this place spends on outside vendors is more than some other companies will make in a year.
