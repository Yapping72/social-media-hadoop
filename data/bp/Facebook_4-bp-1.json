Don't make the same mistake as many of us who have been here for 5 years or more who are pigeonholed.\r\n\r\nCareer opportunities are scare and the flat structures means that it takes on average 8 years to get promoted to a lead engineer while your other schools mates are being promoted every 2 years. Promotions are based on face/ culture fit rather than merit but this is not dissimilar from other companies.\r\n\r\nIf you do choose to join, focus on the future looking roles like data analyst or IT&S.

The last 10 years, every decision made has had bad repercussion on the business, workers and knowledge depletion and yet shareholders keep getting paid at the expense of workers. Higher ups are a closed club and they only promote within their restricted group. New CEO fooled everyone with his supposed \"in touch with workers\" attitude when in reality he is ruthless and is totally out of touch with reality. He spent \"Tweeting or Yammering\" instead of truly running the business (reminds me of TRUMP). Managers are promoted based on who you know and not what you accomplish. Some managers are sooooooo bad that they keep bouncing from one division to the other wrecking havoc but never get fired. In general this organization is absolutely terrible at running assets....hence everytime they sold one, the new owners made out really well and ran that assets 100% better than when it was in BP's hands. This is all due to too much red tape. I view this organization as an oil tanker that takes forever to make a turn while it's competitors are more nimble and are more like frigates. The last 10 years, BP went through 5 reorg all by reducing headcounts or selling assets.

It's often unclear who is accountable and who makes decisions with constantly shifting management priorities.  Too many layers of management that are reorganized and shuffled every 12 to 18 months and regularly roll out non-value adding initiatives that create a ton of work for technical staff, get some manager a promotion, and leave unrealistic expectations for the next manager.  Internal job postings are \"just for show\", new roles and promotion opportunities are largely pre-determined and based on diversity and politics rather than merit.
