Many teams continued to use old front-end tech even for green field work, or engage in procedural rather than object-oriented programming. No technical roadmap or strategy to move away from outdated parts of the tech stack was communicated or mandated.

The sabbatical was taken away despite the fact that many people had been promised it as part of their employment.\r\n\r\n* Did not feel like senior management were team players. We were told that, post-acquisition, Morgan Stanley would let the company keep one of its two big annual events: the manager retreat or the Christmas party. Senior management elected to keep their retreat, while everyone else lost the Christmas party.\r\n\r\n* Aesthetics felt favoured over functionality. Rolling whiteboards were removed from the office with no consultation of the people that used them daily. MacBooks were rolled out before they were ready and despite being a worse development experience (longer build times, etc.).\r\n\r\n* Did not eat their own dog food. Despite making software around implementing equity plans, the company stopped offering regular equity grants to its employees post-acquisition.\r\n\r\n* Retention issues.
