Some of the other benefits are surprisingly stingy. Add the 401k match once a year? Come on, you're in the business - that's a lot compounding power of that money the company is keeping for itself. \r\n\r\nThe Morgan Stanley bureaucracy is stunningly difficult to work with. It can take weeks to get even simple communications approved. Gets in the way of good client service and support.\r\n\r\nUpper management does all the talking and not much listening, so the employee fundamentals don't improve. For example, there is practically no career path for CSMs. \r\n\r\nThere are definitely favorites, and if you're not one of the lucky few, be prepared to stay at the bottom of the pile. That's why some people have been there for a decade or more but in other groups turnover is high.\r\n\r\nThere's a turf battle with E*TRADE that's not pretty. Solium and E*TRADE were arch rivals and I don't think MS cared about what that was going to be like. Lots of legacy Solium leadership got pushed down a level so E*TRADE leadership could be inserted, which is not good optics."}, {"review_title": "Worst Interview Experiences ever", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "\"Brand Name\" \nLocation depending on where you are located", "cons": "I've interviewed with Morgan Stanley a few times over the years.

Benefits are pretty good so long as you don't need too much time with specialists.\r\n\r\nBeer Fridays and bagel Mondays were a thing when working in the office.\r\n\r\nWork life balance is good, I think I only worked overtime 2 or 3 times in the whole time I was there.", "cons": "Management can vary in quality depending who you get as your boss. Some dev managers are great and always have your back when there's a problem. Others are spread too thin and don't have time to help all of their direct reports. Others aren't qualified for the position, haven't received the training but have the position because of their tenure at the company. Directors and up have been at the company so long and seem to be stuck in the small company feel. Managers outside of your section of the hierarchy have been unhelpful and negative in the past, which doesn't help organized cross team collaboration.\r\n\r\nTech debt piles up and is only looked at when it loses the company clients or money. New features are always pushed as an MVP with the thought that it will be improved later but sometimes is only improved months or years later. The tech stack is aging and while there's a push towards RESTful APIs, React, Redux and GraphQL it's moving slowly and management and some devs seem very resistant to pushing the change forwards. The monolith is huge and it's getting bigger faster than proper microservices can be moved out.\r\n\r\nRetention and career advancement seems to be a mystery in how it is managed. I've seen offers to retain at less than 50% of a salary bump compared to an outside offer for very strong employees for some while tens of thousand salary bumps are given for others. You have to fight extremely hard to get any raise over 2%. If you want a raise get an offer from another company and you should be able to get a raise within 2 weeks as opposed to 6-12 months. Haven't experienced it first hand but it I have heard that gender has a large effect on your salary and bonuses which is very disappointing. It was really poor that the 5 week was sabbatical was taken away with such an arbitrary cut off. Especially since so many people were hired when Morgan Stanley and UBS were white label deals (pre buy out) and they got the company to the point where Morgan Stanley bought it. They helped grow the company and then their future sabbaticals were taken away. Very poor move from my point of view.\r\n\r\nDev superstars are given a huge amount of praise and lots of the company's direction is pinned on these people. If they put in the extra hours they get the recognition. This has lead to some pretty toxic people getting senior roles in the dev team, it's sad to see that people who put down their coworkers are rewarded.\r\nQAs are also treated poorly despite that fact that they hold a huge amount of domain knowledge and allow the software to be released in a much better state.\r\n\r\nPost buy out brought in a lot of restrictions to devs. No sudo access on machines, limited software allowed when working from home, really reduces productivity.\r\n\r\nFinally wanted to speak about the CEO Marcos Lopez. When I first started at the company he seemed like a very compassionate person who wanted the best for his company and the people who were there. Granted he has always had a reputation for being tightfisted, the AGM parties and holiday parties were always well done and found a way to show appreciation. As time went on he seemed to change to someone who cared more about the money of the company. One instance that stands out is when the buy out was happening and we were told out grants would be accelerated which I acknowledge it wasn't something Morgan Stanley had to do he said something along the lines of \"It was really nice that they did this, I wouldn't have done that.\" Which is just a terrible thing to say to the people who helped you net a few ten millions off the sale of your company."}, {"review_title": "Brief review", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "23 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Enough and ample leaves are given for employee well being", "cons": "Bad management and poor work culture, exceptional long working hours."}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "work-life balance, best workspace in Canada", "cons": "Technology is not very strong."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work with good benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "13 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Director in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Highly knowledgeable people\r\nCulture of inclusion\r\nGood benefits", "cons": "Technologically challenged, lots of catching up to do to reach industry standard."}, {"review_title": "Greta", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Financial Analyst in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great working experience \r\nFlexibility \r\nGreat working expensive g", "cons": "Not flexible \r\nVery rigued\r\nNot very great"}, {"review_title": "Con", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Consultant in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good company to work at", "cons": "Nothing at moment to comment"}, {"review_title": "Decent", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "solid training program, good pay, competitive environment that pushes you to be your best.", "cons": "very old school mentality, lack of manager training"}, {"review_title": "Overview of Finance Control", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Jun 2021", "job_title": "AVP-Finance in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "the company has great benefits", "cons": "it can be hard to progress if not playing into work politics"}], [{"review_title": "Company Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High reputation, inclusive environment encouraging for individuals who want to learn", "cons": "Expected to work long, non contractual hours"}, {"review_title": "Good company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Stock Plans Representative in Alpharetta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People and managers are great.
