There is no clear promotion criteria and no formal system for annual career reviews. For example, your manager writes a ~2 paragraph performance review once a year but they're not required to collect 360 feedback from your colleagues. There's also no opportunity to give upward feedback to your manager. \n\nLike many big organizations, Mastercard is highly political. As a result, senior leadership can be hit or miss. Many SVPs are figureheads that don't know their business well and don't have the expertise to support their team. Leaders are not rewarded for good management; rather, they are rewarded for executive visibility.
