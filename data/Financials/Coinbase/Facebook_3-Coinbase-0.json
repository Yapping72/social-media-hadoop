This was an extreme and unnecessary step that caused high stress and conflict within the company in the midst of a pandemic. Worse, it alienated minority employees and actively undermined belonging and inclusion work being done. This was the largest unforced error by leadership, but not the first (see also the Chicago office and Neutrino acquisition).\r\n\r\nCoinbase also has an unhealthy self-described \"intense\" work culture.

Some burnout, but just a push to EOY right?\n\nWinter/Spring 22: People start getting coerced to come in to offices and offsites. Most of these become Covid spreader events. Especially after Omicron. But CB does them more and more anyways. Initiatives from Fall start falling short and people start winging things beyond procedures/plans to deliver something.\n\nSummer (recently): Covid rules get thrown out the window and simplified to \"you don't need to be vaccinated but if you feel sick just don't come to work\". They only are making you test negative and be vaxx'd for offsites and travel since other countries largely require these. Employees brace for months of offsites at \"the most convenient office for most important teams\" which is just really everyone rotating into the SF office to work at a big table together with their team and \"collaborate\". Also the 20% layoffs. Also no meals in offices. Also the \"postponement\" of intern return offers. Also huge spends on unnecessary Exec privileges while not paying multiple vendors, contracts, etc. for months (maybe a few million worth at this rate). Also the performance/top performer bonuses and promos to try keeping some around through EOY or maybe to make others who didn't receive them dissatisfied enough to quit before CB has to do more layoffs.

There seems to be a lot of smoke and mirrors. No decisions seem to stick. There are no adults in the room that actually understand execution, as opposed to touring the talk or conference circuit. Doing it quick and dirty is often mistaken for \u201cefficient execution\u201d, as opposed to actually doing it right and not leaving others, usually the Customer Service folks and ultimately our customers, in a lot of pain. Cross-team work is wrought with friction because the teams are very disjointed. We do not have enough technical leaders who want to fix cross-team coordination, probably because there is no respect for that type of work. Experienced leaders have been recruited recently from other industries, like financial services, etc, and then are being set up to fail. People are being forced into the wrong roles. There is no empathy. If you are not from The Big 5 (Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, or Twitter) then you\u2019ll likely be treated like an imposter because pedigree is everything. Scaling is but one problem to be solved in the world, and the fact that you may have solved problems 1000x more complex than blasting tweets will mean very little to them.\r\n\r\nIf you are a diversity hire, you may be treated like a quota, as opposed to someone who actually deserves to be there. This is because like most other tech companies, it is treated as a funnel issue, as opposed to a retention and culture issue. There is a sad lack of diversity in our product and engineering leadership, and consequently, strategic product initiatives. The folks who are there don\u2019t seem to be very \u201cincluded\u201d. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives are being run by people, save for one, who probably have never experienced what it is like to be an underrepresented minority in tech and been one of the unlucky ones to experience discrimination first-hand. How do you actually fix the problem if you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like?  The condescension is real. You\u2019ll spend a lot of time nodding and smiling because if you get upset and speak up, it probably won\u2019t reflect well on you. Save yourself the heartache.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s sad is that diversity and inclusion initiatives are so in your face that the overrepresented folks are beginning to feel excluded too.
