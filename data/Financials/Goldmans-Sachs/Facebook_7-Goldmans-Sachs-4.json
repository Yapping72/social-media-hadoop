There are many internal harassment complaints against almost each senior manager in this group. Diversity, inclusion and meritocracy is non-existent is this group. Overall favoritism prevails and you have a huge advantage if you are young, physically attractive and belong to the predominant demographics in this group. If you are not born this way, be ready to get exploited, be ready to get insulated and screamed at in front of entire floor, be ready to accept significantly low pay (50% less than your peer in some cases). Technology is this group is a mix of modern tech stack, Slang and Goldman's own infrastructure so you will be working on legacy and internal frameworks for significant amount of time. Lot of talented engineers and leaders have left this group and have joined top tech companies due to extremely toxic environment that is not healthy. Work life balance is also a joke. People are there at 7am in the morning and are still in the office at 10pm. Weekends are non-existent.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer - This review is not written by some angry disgruntled employee.

This seemed like a dream come true since I would be doing what I went to school for at a large reputable company. However, I ended up quitting due to what seemed like borderline unethical business practices within the first month of employment. A recruiter reached out to me and told me about the opportunity of being a \"consultant\" at the firm and was looking for \"recent graduates\" in my field of study. I was told the position was \"remote until further notice\" and that I \"would be working as a consultant.\" I took the position because it was remote work, and since I live with high-risk family members, working remotely would allow me to avoid exposure to COVID-19.\r\n\r\nMy recruiter and the management staff confirmed this information, reassuring me that my skills would be of use in the department. Although, this was too good to be true. I found out the hard way that I would be commuting an hour to and from the office every day. I would not be working remotely because my position was actually in their mailroom, sending and receiving customers' transactions (not a joke). Furthermore, I would not be provided a parking permit since the building does not have a parking lot and is in the middle of downtown SLC where daily parking is extremely expensive\u2014eventually telling me that my position was mandatory.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, there was a required executive meeting for all employees where corporate discussed their strategy of \"increasing the number of people returning to the office.\" They stated, \"we want to get 10% of our workforce back in the office,\" and were going to implement \"COVID-19 policies\" to ensure this happened.\r\nThese included all mandatory positions (which now includes mine) to have COVID-19 test(s) per-week and employees we were in charge of ordering them and submitting them before our shift. We had 48 hours to submit our test and perform it on a Zoom call to ensure it was done correctly. If we failed to do this, \"we would be denied access into the building, and it would be flagged on a watch list\" if we attempted to scan.\r\n\r\nIf everything did go through according to plan with the test, we were instructed to wait in the lobby 15-30 mins before each shift to verify we didn't have COVID-19, and we would not be compensated for lost time.\r\nThis was the final straw for me. I returned my work equipment to the security desk and walked out. My understanding of the job I agreed to went from \"working remotely as an investment consultant\" to this horrible scenario that doesn't even resemble consulting work that happened in a few weeks. I could believe this was even happening, nor could anyone I mentioned this to. I have worked as a consultant before in other large organizations (Universal Studios being one), and they never treated employees like this. Furthermore, I did provide consulting work for Universal.\r\n\r\nI did not do any consulting for Goldman Sachs. \r\n\r\nI was just organizing and inputting mail."}, {"review_title": "Great place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Analyst in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work, lots of energy", "cons": "There can be long hours"}, {"review_title": "Good for analyst", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Analyst in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good to get enough salary to work", "cons": "Harassment is usual in the company"}, {"review_title": "Goldman Sachs", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Vice President in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "excellent training, great co-workers, great cafeteria choices", "cons": "long hours, competitive, compensation fluctuates each year"}], [{"review_title": "Confident in company's growth", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Product Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Deep vertical expertise in core markets, strong talent", "cons": "Long hours, sometimes rigid processes"}, {"review_title": "goldman", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The offer comprises units at \u20ac10 per unit, with each unit consisting of one ordinary share and an eighth of a warrant at IPO, and another eighth of a warrant to be received upon completion of a business combination.
