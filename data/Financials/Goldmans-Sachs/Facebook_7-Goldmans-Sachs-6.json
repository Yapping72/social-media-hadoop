Additionally, Goldman senior management can sometimes run their divisions like fiefdoms - the company is not as horizontally integrated as some of the other firms may be.

Further, much of your pay is based on performance bonus, which reviews are heavily biased and leaves room for wage discrimination.  Immediate management is out-of-touch.  Merit rewards no one... if you'd like to succeed, be sure to network well and create the perception of value.  Emphasis on \"perception\".  Overtime pay is half-time... but if you work any less than 50 hours/week, you'll yourself in a serious \"conversation\" with your manager--regardless as to whether you have work left to do.  Again, the perception of being a valuable employee, and this includes just working late for the sake of working late, is what matters.  But if you still want the job, make sure you play to Goldman's egos, as they like to hear how \"big-deal\" they are, because they work for a \"big-deal\" company.
