This means there are lots of opportunities and a degree of dynamism in the firm", "cons": "- Compensation probably not above market, especially outside NY\r\n- Processes are not yet those of a large firm - this means it can sometimes feel chaotic to work in the firm. E.g. grad programme is not as structured and with less training than in investment banks or consulting firms, for example. HR is quite siloed so Onboarding and training processes can be a bit inconsistent and bureaucratic; career evolution and promotion has historically been something that was very informal and intransparent - this is starting to change\r\n- Firm can still be very NY centric in its organisational structure and view of the world. This can make working outside the US feel sluggish at times, because you need to get approval from the centre or explain why things may have to be done differently outside NY.

Lots of things are governed from above and company standards and decisions made many levels above often do not make sense on the level they have their effect.

Blackrock has also a very hierarchical structure, people need to become people managers at some point if they want to progress with their carrier. (If that is a carrier goal, Blackrock is a good palce to be.) There is very little room for a carrier on a technical path only.

Not meritocratic - at least at the VP/Associate level. I see teams that are overstaffed with people who seem to spend most of their time on busy work or twiddling their thumbs in an effort to look like they're adding value. My biggest personal complaint at the Associate level is that I haven't had opportunities to challenge myself or expand my professional skills in a meaningful way. Career growth is definitely possible but it's all about networking. Clearly, networking should be a portion of a good career growth strategy, but it shouldn't be the only thing (in my opinion). If you're looking for an opportunity to develop professional skills and feel like you're making a real contribution (not just pushing paper), I'd be quite careful in accepting a job in the SF office. The company claims loudly to encourage internal promotion but it's simply not the case. Open positions are overwhelmingly filled by overqualified candidates, often from the outside. The result is a workplace where employees in many divisions aren't provided with any real career opportunity besides using the BLK name to find a better gig."}, {"review_title": "Great Place , Great Benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Associate in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome benefits, very flexible with time off and working arrangements\r\nA lot of opportunities to move around.\r\nLots of resources to grow", "cons": "Pay and interesting work really depends in which department you are in."}, {"review_title": "Good position", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Executive Assistant in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of resources, large firm", "cons": "Large firm can also be challenging to navigate"}, {"review_title": "okay", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Vice President in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "resources available due to size of company", "cons": "culture is not consistent at all levels"}, {"review_title": "good learning", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Analyst in New Delhi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I think we can learn a lot", "cons": "pay is less compared to other companies"}, {"review_title": "Working at BlackRock", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Software Developer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working at BlackRock is great.", "cons": "Can\u2019t think of any atm"}, {"review_title": "very good company to work with", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Business Analyst in Gurgaon, Haryana", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "environment , culture , office , perks , team members", "cons": "nothing as such . its a good company and hav everything one can desire for."}]]
