Makes people who perform strongly, feel average. Of course, it could be argued that it drives strong staff to work even harder (as there are 2 more grades to \"attain\"). Or perhaps its similar to \"tall... and taller\" when referring to short and tall people. My take is that \"Outperformed\" should already indicate a potential promotion candidate -- and \"Strongly Outperformed\" should not exist - as these people should already have been promoted (i.e. the concept of outperforming an outperformer feels... weird)?\r\n\r\n> Very specialist roles / high demands even at Analyst / Associate levels leading to low mobility at those levels - an \"Associate\" would already be expected to know all related technical & financial knowledge regarding the process (and 30-40% of people having 5-10 years experience) - at a minimum, people need to be a VP to even consider mobility into another team to learn something different. Changing teams would literally be resetting the clock (as you would not have the knowledge). Also, imagine trying to compete with people with 5-10yrs experience for promotion... even if you have the same no. of years, you'd just be on par. You'd need very special reasons / projects to get ahead - and not many of these are available due to the highly specialized teams (which mainly focus on their part of the process).\r\n\r\n> Although availability of knowledge is listed as a \"Pro\" above, in terms of working-level knowledge, these are recorded in procedure documents that are confusing to the new joiner, or not recorded at all.

The ERM team has very limited connection with the rest of the BlackRock teams and struggles to integrate in the ecosystem. \r\nTimesheets are not used at all and time allocation is adjusted by the management which is hiding all the valuable information to determine which clients are profitable and who ones are not. When I explained that we should change this process with the correct arguments, it was suggested that I can record my timesheet on my own if I like it...\r\nNon-regression testing is done manually by using print screens of the screen versions and Project Managers are doing the task, because there is not enough workforce in the QA team. \r\nThere is a significant mismatch between the job tasks in a daily basis and job description promised during the interview: lots of solution setup tasks and manual testing for a VP position VS strategy and big changes on the horizon promised during the interview. \r\nAs a FinTech solution, there is not clear strategy of how to develop the business in the future and in addition the current solution is too specific for multiple clients, which means there is serious difficulty to propose proper SaaS solution and that makes the Project Manager's job even more complicated and full of non value added tasks. \r\nNot part of Aladdin and won't be in near future.\r\nIt's difficult to do an internal career transfer, because ERM's business is very different from other BlackRock's business, especially in France."}, {"review_title": "Great company, strong vision & culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "27 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Director in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company, strong vision & culture.

Bonuses are very minimal\n-Be prepared for multiple diversity and inclusion trainings while also hearing how awesome the new business with China is. The hypocrisy of this firm is astonishing\n-The company prides itself on being transparent but it is really not. For example most of the time if you want to trasfer internally, after everything is agreed your manager will ask you to wait 6M-1Year so they can better plan it.
