You can go as far as you want and hard work is recognized. The greatest motivation is the outstanding and committed people around you who have ownership mentality. BlackRock is an enigma. Its a very large company with very few meetings, having only 6 in almost 3 years,very few formal processes but for some reason everyone knows what to do: understanding clients, shareholders and management demands. Nobody tells you what to do but they are very clear on what they expect. If you hate long boring meetings, loathe useless conversations and desire direct access to management, this is the place for you. \r\n\r\nThe secret to BlackRock is their people. They look beyond education and grades (which still are still important) to character, commitment and willingness to learn things outside the comfort zone. You will see liberal arts majors writing code and SQL while computer science majors do their CFA.  Its a very good dynamic, connecting business and engineering.  I told a director in my interview: \"I don't know what you have in mind for me but whatever it is, for every dollar you invest (in me), you will get three back by the end of the year!\". He replied, \"I like confidence!\".   I was interviewing at GE to be a sourcing manager at the same time. I chose BlackRock, not really understanding the role, but rather on the energy.  \r\n\r\nI even met Charlie Hallac after my 2nd week. The company #3 knew who I was, calling out a few points on my CV during our impromptu conversation. BlackRock MD's and executives see everything from afar like Odin sees the world through his ravens. I received several emails from MDs and executives, thanking me when I stayed up late doing extra QC on days with large market movements.\r\n\r\nThe colleagues helpfulness depends on who you ask. If you persist, you can get help. I even learned to code by bothering and annoying my colleagues on a regular basis.  If you smile and show a lot of energy, even the most grumpy give in, teaching you something.  There is no formal training process. On day one, you are given a black notebook and a pen. Then its baptism by fire. Its very important to write everything down because they remember what they told you, getting very upset if they have to repeat themselves.  People yell at you, a lot, but its ok. It is part of the learning process and gives you good war stories later.  The first 6 months, you feel lost but then things start to click, so hang in there.\r\n\r\nHard work at BLK does not go unnoticed. The experience and long hours paid off with a position 2-3 levels higher in another company. As a director at the new job with hiring responsibility, the first thing I did was search out my former colleagues with the goal of replicating this culture.", "cons": "I started this job at 39 years of age.  Keeping up with aggressive young people with high IQ's, good breeding and raw ambition wears you out.   The hours are very long, but this is necessary to learn the job. The job is also addictive. No one tells you to stay late, you sort of do this on your own, losing track of time because the work is actually interesting and you feel needed. This pays off. Having BlackRock on your CV can land you a very good job anywhere in the world. It takes a few years after you left to understand this. The biggest con is that the Delaware office is next to a graveyard. Its a depressing view, especially when your old."}, {"review_title": "Just great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Analyst in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great atmosphere, great, great, great", "cons": "Can be political, okay, okay"}, {"review_title": "Long interview process", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Vice President in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits and good work life", "cons": "The interview process was one of the longest I\u2019ve been through"}, {"review_title": "Interesting work with smart people", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Analyst in Hong Kong", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- good work life balance\r\n- executive exposure", "cons": "-pay package not competitive with sell side"}, {"review_title": "Bad culture, directionless management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Associate in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Office facilities, flexi leave policy", "cons": "Top management (US) needs to look at local India management.

In general, people are not really given incentive to do their jobs well. Good performance is rarely rewarded, bad performance is rarely punished. As far as I know, the bonuses are more-or-less evenly distributed to be about 1 monthly salary, literally not even depending on your actual performance.

The \u201canything that can be sold to the clients is already good enough\u201d attitude is not driving people here to make good solutions, especially in markets artificially created by regulatory rules.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThere are some demotivated people. If you engage a random employee in a 1on1 deep conversation, and show that it is okay to be actually honest, and you ask about how they feel about BlackRock, they often will end complaining for an extended period of time, and say that this is just a stepping stone for them, a good place to learn, but they don't think of staying here long term.  In fact, how much people believe that BlackRock is a great place is strongly correlated to how much they have to sell that \"BlackRock is a great place\" to others. HR who has to sell the firm to possible hires, or client facing teams might be overly positive, but isolated teams like FMG might be overly negative about it.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tTech solutions aren\u2019t too cutting edge. Most of the tech solutions here are rather deprecated. There are codebases in such shape, that most of the people agree that only a complete rewrite could save them. You sometimes better off reimplementing something than using the previous work of another BlackRock employee. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tTeams are organized in an ineffective way. The HR of BlackRock really believes that diversity makes better teams. The employees of BlackRock actually like to make fun of how much it does not work, and how most of the people dislike working in such teams.\r\nBut diversity here also implies that teams are usually spread across multiple locations - often with huge time zone difference, making even more difficulties in teamwork.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPlanning for the future is undervalued. The management only have supper vague plans for the future, that are not detailed enough for practical use. Even for current projects, there are often no specifications or detailed plans.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tHigh turnover. Most of the BlackRock employees leave after a few years. For software developers, the \"senior developer\" layer is almost completely missing. There are managers who have been here for more than 10 years, and there are juniors who joined in the past 3 years, but there's not much people in between.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe talent pool is not that exceptional.

The problem is that there aren't great mechanisms to recognize which parts of the business run very lean and responsibly, versus those that don't, and that can cause frustration...and worse, gridlock at times.

SF is a satellite office, even though there is superior technical talent.  Management will tell you otherwise, but that is how it is.\r\n2) Your experience will largely depend on what group you are in and where your group is located.  If you work in SF, be part of an SF-based group.  Many groups are remote, resulting in lots of phone calls.  What could be accomplished in minutes takes hours.\r\n3) Most MDs are in NY, so you get limited face-time if you are working on the west coast.  They generally don't know what you are working on and what skills you bring to the table.  If you can sit with them in their office, you have a huge advantage (i.e., if you are located on the east coast).\r\n4) Career growth is limited.  Promotions are based on your relationship with your MD (and your manager), not technical skill.  I've seen tech people with years of schooling and experience stagnate, while biz people with soft skills (i.e., anyone could pick up at work) get promoted.  Although the company prides itself on being technology-oriented, technical people are second-class citizens.  Any biz school grad with the same skills/knowledge/drive as a tech grad will be 1-2 steps ahead in the hierarchy.\r\n5) Speed is rewarded over quality.  New projects pop up continually and are pushed out without spending the proper time designing solutions.  Technical debt is knee-deep.\r\n6) Project management is seriously lacking.  Managers tend to think up their own methodologies rather than studying best-practices in the industry.\r\n7) Lots of talk about innovation, but years behind tech companies.\r\n8) Tons of context switching.

Totally unstructured process of developing process, literally no unit-test cases written, or full-time tester testing your developed software but aiming for 'whatever you've done will work when released'! They do not understand or implement Agile software development methodology and use JIRA as a substitute assuming that by itself is Agile methodology. Absence of a process means believing in incorrect estimations of work and blaming that on your team members in year-end review.\r\n\r\nTo correct the decade-old bad software left behind by employees who have left, rewriting and reinventing software is not possible since moving a brick will cause business to be disrupted and I've tried earnestly and my manager watched silently to blame me for my efforts. Problem-solving and design-thinking (the very core tenet of software engineering) is non-existent! Following such a practice for a year only makes you a bad engineer and develops an attitude of complacency and incompetence (with correct practices).\r\n\r\nApplying Organizational Behavior, I could notice employees working too many extra hours (both on weekdays and on weekends). Male employees with grey hair at the age of 25 and several others going bald at an age of 28-30 due to over-working, fighting frustration and bad mental health. I had noticed employees having an accident/surgery and showing up to work (on sometimes crutches) next day. Workload management and Empathy was missing! I had to hide my happiness and minor accomplishments from my own team and manager.\r\n\r\nYour year-end review will be frustrating and a big let down in your overall career because your will be evaluated against goals/job description you did not set! You only realize the bad experience in the job after being deep down in the bad shape and how bad an engineer you had become after you make a good move (i.e. find a good job) and become a good competitive engineer again, and earn a promotion with fair and spirited team culture and mentors. \r\n\r\nRest you go figure."}], [{"review_title": "BlackRock culture", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Competitive salary and bonus.

HR will listen to you and say they have to investigate and then get back to you. They never actually do. Meanwhile the perpetrators of these issues are promoted and given more responsibility.

Most are burnt out quickly looking for an exit.   \r\n\r\n- there are too many \"deadwood\" employees who are ineffective lumps that simply gave up at some point.   Management & HR does little to off load these staffers.   \r\n\r\n- compensation was just above average.  Bonus discussions went like this w/ managers \"I have your comp number here but before we discuss that let's talk about what I need from you going forward\" - insert project laundry list of huge tasks you'll now have to incorporate into your already overloaded plate.  \r\n\r\n- once you decided to leave the firm and resign you'll be publicly labeled a \"non-performer\" by management (regardless of your tenure or performance).
