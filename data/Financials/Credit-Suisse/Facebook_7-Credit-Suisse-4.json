Like their competitors CS's S&T internship introduced interns to all the relevant concepts and practices necessary for a career in S&T. The week long training course offered at the beginning of the internship was very well done and though hurried was thorough. Interns were placed on a single desk to the duration of their internship giving them the opportunity to form strong relationships (if they chose to) as well as complete a single project. The single desk placement also allowed for a much deeper understanding of a specific role in the firm. Additionally Interns were required to attend morning research meetings and were required to attend weekly talks given by managers in other groups (commodities, IBD etc).", "cons": "The single desk placement was a double edged sword for many. While it provided a lot of benefits in giving interns a chance to get to know their managers and teammates, it also prevented them from seeing other groups which they may have interacted with better. Interns placed into Equities were easily able to sit with members of the Derivatives groups but this would be on their own time and generally they would not complete projects with that group. As each group had its own interns, asking for work in a team different from the one assigned to you could be seen as \"poaching\" opportunity from another intern. The scope of the projects was also varied and some interns felt they did not have a chance to show their potential. Projects ranged from fairly rigorous computer programming (for those qualified) to more mundane research papers/presentations. Interns with rigorous projects often felt they were unable to sit with other groups and experience more of the firm. Interns with very simple projects felt that they were not given a chance to show their value add. A final note about the group placement is that it radically impacted your chances of being brought on full time. This internship took place in the summer of 2008 in the Hong Kong office, and as a result hiring was down significantly. Those interns that were brought on full time were isolated into specific groups that had available head count. These groups were able to hire all or most of their interns while other groups were unable to hire any despite indicating that the intern had performed at an exceptional level and would have received employment in different economic circumstances."}, {"review_title": "First Job - Glad that they offered me the opportunity but eventually, gratefulness can only go so far", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Jul 2014", "job_title": "CRO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "CRO is in flux so internal mobility and international assignments/relocations are very possible They are always accepting new hires (not necessarily a good thing - cos turnover is high).", "cons": "Constant, non stop, budget reviews and cost cuttings make it next to impossible to retain good talent.

IT procurement is probably one of the most painful due to the number of justifications and approvals required.\r\n\r\nTight budgets and heavy regulations will likely have an effect on your productivity one way or another. The plus side to this is that, compared to smaller companies, accountability, ownership and responsibility is more heavily weighted here but I've been in situations where there has been finger pointing or where people didn't take responsibility for a project or consequence. \r\n\r\nWorking in IT I'm exposed to what seems to be a never-ending spree of change freezes which, unless you request an exception, causes all production impacting changes to be postponed until after the freeze, major/minor releases, changes to a production server, even the smallest of changes.\r\n\r\nAlong with the above CS seems to have a process for everything (if you can find out what it is). Having a relatively junior position I use my naive-ness to point out processes that are much too burdensome for small requests but a lot of time there's a lot of push-back to change the process that has been around for a long time (people also like hiding behind processes to evade extra work or to play the evasion/hot-potato game). It sometimes feels like I'm taking to a brick wall in these situations and the only way is to escalate this up but sometimes it's just not worth bothering.\r\n\r\nBeing a global organization means that certain platforms and applications are only supported out of one region and sometimes you'll loose a good chunk of time due to time-zone delays (you're always asleep when they're awake and vice versa).

They gave me a lowball offer that I unfortunately had to take - not a great way to start building trust.\r\n\r\n2) All the decisions for this company are made in other regions.  Equity derivatives IT was a bare-bones operation in AMRS.  The management decisions were made in London and nearly ALL of the development and tech talent was in Singapore.  Every ounce of knowledge I needed to learn was offshore and specifically in Singapore.  I consider myself a fairly motivated person driven to succeed but you can't build a good initial knowledge base of the systems you need to work on if the only folks you have to talk to are in the complete opposite time zone and too busy to teach you which leads me to my next point.\r\n\r\n3) The folks in Singapore(mostly from India) were worked like they were at a Foxconn factory and we in AMRS were expected to compete with that.  This essentially means no upward mobility if you want any kind of a life.\r\n\r\n4) The lower level managers are pretty weak and transparent in their efforts to pull results out of people and teams.  I wouldn't consider any of them good leaders or even good mentors.  Managers are afraid of upper management and just whip folks below them.  Part of this is company culture but years later being in that position myself I either mentor and look after my folks properly or it's time to leave.\r\n\r\n5) Insane amount of bureaucracy but this is typical of a Swiss bank - you wouldn't see this at other investment banks at that time.\r\n\r\n6) Insanely cheap; penny wise and dollar foolish - management couldn't wait to get their hands on the next up and coming tech-region where folks were even more desperately looking for work.  This year Singapore, next year close down that hub and head over to Malaysia or somewhere else all the while killing continuity in your development projects and team growth.  It's not like they were paying the folks in Singapore anything good either compared to a salary in the EMEA or AMRS region.  Beyond that, offshoring everything and providing everyone an awful service just to save a buck just gets annoying to all but upper-management.  You're constantly trying to sync up with folks in other regions and more time is spend doing that than actually getting anything done.\r\n\r\nYears later I have learned that offshoring can be utilized but there are limits.  Follow-the-sun models and regional dependencies look great on paper but in reality they are much tougher to execute properly for the folks actually doing it.  You'll wind up with a high turnover rate.\r\n\r\n7) No free coffee - this seems small and petty but it raises an important point.  If a company is too cheap to offer free coffee at the bare minimum you do NOT want to work for them.  This is the cheapest and simplest daily \"thank-you\" lifestyle accommodation a company can make for their employees.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are folks who are very happy in this company but they are at least at the director level where they can stay above the churning of the masses.  Don't be dazzled by big banks for IT; you will not get ahead there.
