Many departments are top heavy with ratio of one actual working analyst/executive to 4 directors (managers and above).  \r\nii) Frequent restructurings occur due to change in senior management. Most of them are politically driven which affect the day-to-day work and \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d of the lower level. \r\niii) Like most organizations, internal politics are common. Innocent employees will get caught in the crossfire.\r\n\r\nPoor Management and Weak Culture. \r\ni)\tWeak company results led to low bonuses (for certain departments) and huge attrition. They would rather hire contract staffs and keep resources lean. In view of the low bonus and high contract staffs, most employees have a very \u201csilo\u201d style of working.  Employees carry a \u201cwatch-your-own-back\u201d and disengaged attitude at work to protect themselves first. \r\nii)  The huge attrition reflects weak culture and poor management.\r\niii) Internal processes are lacking or lost in transition due to staff attrition and offhsoring. Knowledge has been lost in some cases. Most of the best practices are either verbal or handed over from generation to generation without proper documentation. New joiners will not have a clear picture of certain processes and/or how things are done and handled.\r\niv) As a result of the attrition and restructuring, roles were filled by employees with little or no relevant experience in order to quickly fill in the vacancies/new roles. The poor job fit saw the hiring of leaders or managers with the inability to make effective decisions, poor leadership and ineffective management skills. This also led to mismanagement in the career of the affected employees.  \r\nv) Very slow career progression (below average) with almost no visible path for development. Depending on department, management makes promotion almost unattainable. \r\n\r\nInefficient Management of Resources \r\ni) Offshoring and Globalization of resources resulted in internal inefficiencies. Work related issues ranging from HR to IT are remotely operated. A lot of time is wasted on sending screenshots and waiting for someone in another time zone to respond to your issues. Cultural and language issues have not been considered when the company decides to offshore these functions, e.g. first and last name wrongly reflected in the main intranet system by someone from another region who is not familiar with the first and last name of the people from that particular region resulting in a lot of time being wasted to rectify the error as this was also fed into other systems maintained by other teams. A lot of simple issues could be resolved easily with just having someone onsite and without having unnecessary tickets to be raised in addition to having few different people from different parts of the world contacting the person for the rectification works. \r\nii) A lot of work that has been offshored have processes that were either lost in translation or transition. Some of these resulted in a lot of internal inefficiencies in having to try to understand changed or new processes that came with the offshoring resulting in possibly some duplication of work or unnecessary work. \r\n\r\nOffshoring and Contract Hiring led to Substandard HR Practices\r\ni) The exit interview is conducted via an automated online survey that is crafted in a conniving manner that does not allow the employee to clearly explain the main reason(s) for leaving.\r\nii) The lack of interaction from HR also shows that the company does not value its employees"}, {"review_title": "Business Analyst", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "23 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Business Analyst in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The IT infrastructure is more developed than some of its peers.
