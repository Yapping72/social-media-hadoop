This behaviour standard is prevalent top down.\r\n\r\n3.) Real change in work environment takes commitment, collaboration and \r\n patience from senior management. Instead, the go to approach seems to be \r\n an unhealthy obsession with numbers and to show overnight improvement, with out dealing with foundational issues. \r\n\r\n4.) SVPs, in certain instances have used sentences like - you don't need people of \"MY Level\" to be present to solve these small issues, when they came into these meetings at their own will. \r\nAdvice is not come into meetings, if they do not have the capacity to deal with smaller issues. They have a choice not be present. Being absent in such situations is better than being present and demotivating a whole room of people with their \"Inclusivity is for you and not for me\" attitude.\r\n\r\n5.) With no role empowerment, micro management and showing unnecessary dominance are major issues which are accepted widely as a way of operation with in teams. \r\n\r\n6.)

Branch employees were expected to work during the pandemic, often without a branch manager, but without pay increases, either to adjust for the risk of in-person work or even just an adjustment for overall inflation during COVID.\nCost cutting means that clients have seemed to not always come first in terms of corporate's priorities. The systems are heavily unreliable, with lots of incompatible technology that seldom seems to work. Corporate says the solution to everything is usually in the Source, which is the database referenced when helping customers. Often, the solution is not in the Source, and clients end up frustrated without many answers.\nCiti Customer Service was always sending clients into the branch, saying that we could help them with things we had no control over. This is probably a result of miscommunication to the customer service representatives.\nThe customer satisfaction surveys don't make any sense. Employees are held to a standard based on \"Net Promoters\", which refers to people who score the service as a 10/10, or 100%. Each survey that is 9 or below counts as a 0% score, with 0 resulting in a negative percentage. Branches were judged based on the monthly average, but this would often not reflect our actual performance because lots of people just don't give 10s on principle. What this means is we provide great service, get recognized for our competence in the client's review in word, but a score of 9 counts as a 0 and we are punished (usually in the form of a negligible annual pay raise, with the justification of being an \"under-performing\" branch."}], [{"review_title": "I must have joined the wrong team, experience so far is very different to general reviews here", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Senior Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I\u2019m new to the team and best things I can see so far - Very good benefits and salary.

Then another manager on another team may not be as relaxed they may say no you have to come in 3 days a week full office days. Also there training and what they want you to do is all over the place. Pretty your manager runs the show on your team. So what you see what everyone else do doesn't mean you will be allowed to do the same. They are a lil relaxed as far as time off kind of. If you are ok with being chained to a desk and figuring out how you make the rich even more richer than this the job for you. But to me the stress isn't worth the headache of staying. If you can find something else use this as a stepping stone and move on. But for some people it's the dream job. Also you have to use your own PTO to pay yourself on a holiday when we are off that's should be a company paid holiday smh. That chips away from our vacation PTO. My only real complaint is they don't prepare you for your job. You are winging it. And they get mad when you arent ahead like you should be because their training structure sucks. Also covid numbers is COVID rising and they still want us in office 3 days a week. And ppl are coming in office and getting sick. Also they dont pay you when your sick with covid. You have to pay yourself outta your pto. Most workers just work from home when they have covid even if you have symptoms!
