You WILL be working more than 40 hours per week, EVERY week, contrary to the \"...on rare occasions you may have to work a couple of extra hours\" that is told during the hiring process (as you will find out at the beginning of training when you start hearing and seeing the real hours).\r\n\r\nCulture and General Work: Very negative, depressing culture, from the top-down. I am a person who can find a positive in any situation, as are many great coworkers at CitiGroup, but after working 12-16 hour days and weekends (no overtime pay), and still being told by management that we aren't doing enough and need to work harder / faster, positives are hard to find; constant verbal threats about job security / performance plans, etc...without support or how they are going to fix the unreal work imbalance across the floor. After 1.5 years of working non-stop (including holidays from home), I had had enough and voluntarily resigned; I was the 29th person to do so in only 2 months! The Team Lead's will tell you how great you are doing on your cases and QA scores, etc...and then later that same day, tell you how you need to be doing more cases, although they know that you are putting in all of the extra hours and doing great work (?? - confusing, makes you feel defeated and frustrated? Yes!). \r\n\r\nBenefits / Pay: 20% below industry average pay and subpar benefits. Citi is an international, huge company, yet I the benefits were the worst that I had ever had working in various industries for 15+ years.

The nature of the job essentially means you are permanently 'on call', so expect to check emails during holidays and weekends, and expect that you could be asked to come into work at the drop of a hat - I had colleagues who had to reschedule holidays and I cancelled many of my own weekend plans to work on last minute deals. This can take a toll on your mental and physical health, so make sure you are mentally prepared for these hours before you apply. A culture of 'face time' also still exists, which can be quite frustrating from time to time.

A simple team lead/supervisor is labeled Vice President, President or Director.\nEmployees have good benefits but no work-life balance. Having 5 weeks of paid vacation is useless because you can never take it when you want, only when management says you can. Usually they just tell you to take a week off, with no warning, so you can't plan for anything.

Someday the company will be sued because of this.  The local hospitals comment as soon as you say you work at Citi that the majority of their cardiac patients come from Citi.  All the good IT talent leaves Citi, they always ask why and do nothing to change it.  The answer is low pay.

When it's time for reviews, you have to stop what you're doing to fill out timely self evaluations (twice a year) where you have to justify your own job, only to be kept on, and receive a terrible excuse for a merit raise once a year.  A $500 raise per year (after taxes) is enough to treat yourself to a single person meal at Outback Steak House once a month...as long as you use a coupon though.  Most mortgage workers will leave under good terms to go to a competitor, only to come back to Citi within 6 months to a year at a higher rate of pay, and repeat this to pad their salary.

In the mean time, you will witness tons of people not doing the target but getting the same credit as you do. \r\n\r\nManagement mentality usually based on \"saving the day\", instead of fixing the problem. There is this saying in Citi management: \"There are no problems until someone says so\". And \"someone\" here is the upper management.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to be successful in Citi, the easiest way is to be in a \"development program\". Just to make the programs look \"better\", all program members are always get promoted to positions that they don't even have an idea. And the people who actually have a great experience, will be doing their job without any chance of promotion and half of the salary. At the end of they these people will receive official certifications while experts/high performers receive nothing.\r\n\r\nSenior management prefers their management team to be obedient people without any skill requirement. This creates a huge issue in times of challenges as they are usually incapable of handling the pressure or finding solutions to even small matters.\r\n\r\nIf you win a prize (instant recognition), there is a big chance that you won't receive it but instead get a\" day off\" replacement. In Citi, there is always a budget cut.\r\n\r\nManagement is usually too lazy to speak English (with some exceptions)\r\n\r\nThere are no free coffee, tea or milk. You need to bring it yourself."}, {"review_title": "Good work/life balance", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Oct 2016", "job_title": "Senior Business Analyst in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Allows working from home, and flexible working policies which means many stay for many many years.

They allow managers to have disgretion if you get your bonus- even if you met all standards and were a top performer. They can take it away for petty things like a disagreement with your manager earlier in the month. \r\n\r\nCiti has an unrealistic expectation of how collectors talk to customers and has a very confusing scoring card for the call. There is no script to go by. You have to ask many many questions about what happened to them financially to get them behind, where are they now financially, and when do they think the situation will change and include dates.

Unachivable at times for many reps.  \r\n\r\nCommunication is horrible all around. It is very hard to know what is going on within the site. Some reps don't have emails to get communication. Changes to policies happen without notification/training (many times the communication isn't passed to reps). If a change is made and you are not there that day, you may never know of the change. Sometimes these are big changes that will prevent you from passing your calls- thus leading to your bonus being revoked. \r\n\r\nTraining is minimal because there is not a active training system to prepair you for real calls. You don't know what you are doing until you have to hit the floor and have to figure it out on your own. Training for calls consists of powerpoint slide shows, not an active training system. You also get to sit and listen to reps but most will not allow you to touch the system because it will effect their stats. Thankfully, reps understand this because they have been there, and are always willing to help out the new hire once they get to the floor.    \r\n\r\nLots of FDCPA violations all around because the auto dialing system doesn't work very well. Making changes to make sure we are in compliance has taken years (3+ at this site).  They are still working on fixing it!!! Changes like this take forever and as a rep I really can not understand why. \r\n\r\nHR (on site) is substandard. They refer you to a 1 800 # for everything and can not explain to you issues about benefits, pay, leave, or anything else for that matter. They are there for hiring, firing, and investigating personel issues. When you work in a call center the last thing you want to do is call another call center.

Yet, I was also talked-to about coming to work sick, since I could pass it along, and should stay home if I was ill.\r\n\r\nAnother issue was the call scoring.  A new metric was introduced that had everyone in the center failing -- literally everyone.  It was, and still may be, very much based in the OPINION of the listener, on such things as, \"did you establish a relationship with the caller\" and such wishy-washy points that allowed managers to trash the employees they didn't like.  I was an award-winning employee, for my call quality, and could barely pass, occasionally.  Most people in my section had failed, failed failed, despite being conscientious long-term, experienced employees, many who had almost never failed a call scoring.  One was failed for \"hitting all the points, but not in the right order.\" \r\n\r\nThe order of the score sheet had never been brought up to anyone else I talked to about her review, and my passing calls were often not \"in order\" of the score sheet requirements.  Calls just don't flow by script, and in fact, we could be dinged for sounding like we were following a script.  Another catch-22 for her.   I watched people with 12-20 years with Citi quit or retire, because they suddenly could not pass a call, and many were crushed, would be in tears.  I hope this scoring system has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe list of items on the score list was enormous.  One of the agents printed it out as points to follow, on calls, and there were more than 20 items on it.  But calls over 20 minutes long would not be scored (too long for the managers to listen to) and those would of course be the calls that all points could have been met on...\r\n\r\nAnother supervisor was fired, while I was in that section, for abuse.  However, it had taken a year of complaints by various employees.  Again, I saw employees in tears, and crushed, after being with him, having been called stupid, and verbally berated in an entirely unprofessional and unacceptable way. Such complaints should have been taken seriously much sooner.\r\n\r\nDialer is run out of Kansas City (or was) and often started repeating, or sending us other inappropriate calls.  This was constant and rarely addressed, and on a Saturday, could not be addressed at all.

Senior management excelled at talking the talk, few actually walked the walk (with a few exceptional and notable examples... of whom there has been no equal).  Merit pay is really not merit pay. Senior management decides based upon budget how many can receive top evaluations that merit pay increases. In a department that employs say 100 people this can mean that only a handful can obtain a score to merit an increase, regardless of whether their performance merits one or not. They start with what the department will receive in terms of budget and then they work their numbers from there. One poor manager can truly mess up an employee's life. Senior managers express the view that employee benefits are \"given\" to employees rather than earned compensation. Bureaucracy is be all, end all, to the point where attempts at quality control reviews earned violation warnings retroactive to the employees being notified of policy changes on call handling, and even created a circumstance where employees could be coached on a \"high risk\" call, but the employees were told they had to sign they had reviewed the call handling with their manager, but they were not permitted to see or to understand what the high-risk factor was, to listen to the call, or to know any of the reasons why (or to even be able to review what was written on the reverse side of the document presented for their signature). If an employee balked or raised questions about these sorts of practices, they risked being labeled as \"difficult.\" Older and longer term employees would have goal posts for performance changed in apparent move by management to rid the company of more highly compensated longer term employees in favor of younger, newer hires (even giving newer hires different performance goals to meet for call handling)."}, {"review_title": "Good environment, poor IT infrastructure, organisational issues", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 May 2014", "job_title": "Senior Java Developer in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have been welcomed by a friendly environment.

Some of the smartest, most driven individuals who care deeply about the work, and the culture is quite open: people seldom turn down a request for a personal meeting and they are generous with opening up the network to you.

Great intellectual stimulation for those seeking that, and I found that in spades in the business.\n-The global reach. Citi has been in many countries for 100+ years, so the relationships with global partners run deep. Few companies can match that know how and this global connectivity is an undeniable competitive advantage vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors.\n-Benefits.

Yes, there is a less bright side: While people are open, there is  poor change management capability (especially at the senior exec levels) so constant change by mandate is the norm - re-org after re-org and relentless cost-cutting measures and lay offs are the BAU... the result is heavy attrition of talented people and burnout for those who stay.\n-Internal mobility. While Citi historically prides itself as a great place to build global talent, the internal recruiting and mobility process is currently broken at best. Jobs often don\u2019t go to most qualified candidates (it\u2019s who you know - the employee engagement survey points to this), the process of applying for a new job internally usually takes several months (and there is lack of transparency/feedback in process, etc.) and if you have aspirations to move internationally, you\u2019re pretty much on your own moving yourself/figuring it out unless you are an MD.\n-Slow to change. It\u2019s a 200 year old bank, and the resistance to change runs deep. It is frustrating to see so many people with great ideas and those ideas getting dying in the vine constantly because: 1) key decisions are almost always made by senior leaders (meaning change leaders lower in the hierarchy are disempowered) , 2) company lacks the infrastructure to drive change: poor technology/productivity platforms, procurement processes are impossibly slow, etc. and 3) fear of failure - lots of saving face goes on, creating an environment where failure and experimentation are not welcome, therefore - innovation is stunted."}, {"review_title": "Senior equity markets employee", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "2 Feb 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of resources and  reach of the firm.

There is a ton of variety here and you can work hands deep in code for a team in Hong Kong or stay a mile high working on a project for the offices in New York - and you can frequently do it all from home (depending on the team).\r\n\r\nTraining and career development are a lifestyle here, with constant offers of paid-for training courses and opportunities to get industry certifications cheap (such as the PMP or others). There is also a lot of internal support structure to provide and receive mentorship.\r\n\r\nA huge plus at Citi is the corporately accepting culture of people of \"all walks,\" including people of any gender, sexual orientation, or other social descriptor.

EX) 1st shift is 0600-1430, 2nd shift is 1330-2200, and 3rd shift is 2130-0600. This is also not a M-F position, most people in the office work on a non standard week, Su-Tr, Tu-Sa, etc. While there is a pay differential for \"non-standard hours,\" it is also extremely difficult to get into a schedule that is considered standard M-F. Taking time off is also extremely difficult, as the entire department is currently understaffed, especially on weekends, and they have a minimum number of staff that they require be there to cover their products. So if you work every Saturday, and want to take a Saturday off less than two months in advance, good luck to you. Oh and the opportunity to take off holidays at the end of the year was gone in the vacation bid at the beginning of 2016, which was based on seniority so most people did not get those days off. Also, if you were awarded a new schedule, be prepared to wait 3 months at a minimum to move into your new schedule as they require that your current shift be filled before you can move. And with how slowly they are hiring, and how quickly we are losing people to other positions or companies, moving shifts is becoming more and more difficult.\r\n\r\nFor a position that is salaried and is considered an exempt position, there are very little opportunities to take breaks - most analysts do not take lunch every day, and even when you do feel you have the opportunity to take a lunch you are only allowed 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nFeedback in this role is also abysmal; the department had a total of 5 managers for a 100 full-time, salaried employees for more than 6 months before filling their management gaps. During that time, year end reviews were held with managers that have very little time to notice you and provide actual constructive feedback. Management consistently speaks of \"progress\" and making much needed changes to how things are operated, but changes take far too long to be implemented.\r\n\r\nThe job responsibilities are straightforward, but they oversell the \"analyst\" portion of the job; currently it is more of a \"button-pusher\" position.

They are really big on meeting handle time goals, quality goals, and other goals there. If you don't improve, they may fire you. There was a girl who had gotten an award for best 1st call resolution rate but yet they fired her shortly after because her handle time was too high.

ALSO, it crashes when it feels like\u2014especially in the middle of the transaction!\r\n- SURVEYS! Basically every branch and area is paid out based on scores from a surveys. Of course, other factors are included as well, but surveys are from teller, service, or sales experience and anything below a 9 is BAD. This is terrible if you work in Manhattan, where people have no patience to listen to you talk about surveys AND if people have issues with Citi as a whole, they give bad scores based on that.\r\n- No work/life balance! If you're a student or have other commitments, forget it! Some managers are compromising but for the most part you have to bend over backwards to cover other tellers (tellers with seniority do whatever they want).\r\n- If you work part-time, you work full-time. This can be a con for people who have other commitments outside of Citi. Obviously if someone is applying for a part-time position, they wish to work part-time hours. If you say no, you never hear the end of it. \r\n- Sales goals are unrealistic. Sales are also too political. If a banker or CRM is really close with a teller, they always give sales to that teller\u2014even if it wasn't his/her referral. Only booked referrals count.\r\n- Allowing non-customers to cash checks. This is so sketchy and upper management is complaining about fraud every other day. I don't know how they can expect us to properly figure out fraudulent checks and catch fake IDs when the system is crashing all the time.
