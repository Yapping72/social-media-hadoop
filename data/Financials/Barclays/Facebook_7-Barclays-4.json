Org design at lower team levels feel arbitrary. One team I was on was filled with directors and BA4s but few VP/AVP leading to too much strategy and not enough delivery. Current team filled with VPs who overlap and need more processors.\r\n\r\n- Very limited growth & advancement opportunities in the US - the firm recently underwent a seismic org redesign, resulting in scores of Directors and above being laid off with the same jobs relocated to the UK. Very unlikely to be promoted beyond VP in the US\r\n\r\n- In the US in order to receive recognition, increase remit/responsibility, you have to sacrifice worklife balance - aka meetings on UK hours before work and work all day. Better than the past, but still little timezone respect. Have to choose between a 5 AM meeting (advancing career by gaining exposure, knowledge, getting the information to just do your job) and wellbeing.\r\n\r\n- Pay is subpar for the industry in NYC. Losing talent in the US to other firms who will pay normal salary and promote. \r\n\r\n- Pre COVID comments but still valid- no budget for anything. Systems only replaced when the third party is about to decommission support (= fire drill). Holiday party (pre-cv) no budget in NYC- could afford a drink a person (not all even got one) and a couple apps. Seems like they had a lot of fun in the UK though.\r\n\r\n- 'Committed' to reducing gender pay gap, but not very transparent. Would like to to see honest reports by business area/function/location. My male peer on my team, performing a similar job function (but who I sit above in the team/management hierarchy and who has not been at the firm as long as me) makes $50,000 more in base pay. \r\n\r\n- Sense of care for wellbeing is well intentioned and widely broadcasted, however, it feels like a farce.
