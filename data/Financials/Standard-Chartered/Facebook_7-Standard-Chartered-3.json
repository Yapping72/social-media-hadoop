The people that have been around for more than 2 years are inevitably those that are best place to avoid getting caught by this - have either managed to fire and apportion blame or have avoided decisions or rose through the ranks quickly.  It's sadly apparent throughout the organization.  The functions are mediocre to incompetent and don't know how to support front office.  The middle and front of offices are working off of antiquated systems - there has been no investment in improving systems, majority of investment is on regs.  The conundrum faced by the institution is that so many areas of the bank need to be literally burnt down and rebuilt, but the cost to do so is so great, that it is simply not possible from the highest stakeholders (shareholders, board) on down.  Senior management rolled out a campaign recently, presumably to fulfill it's obligation to \"change the culture\" called \"Our Shared Values.\"  In some ways it is good and necessary but in others it is a sad reflection on the state of the bank.  For instance, value #1 is \"do the right thing.\"  In my opinion, anyone that is not clear on or doesn't automatically know to do the right thing shouldn't be at the bank to begin with.

A large part of this is because the bank supports \u201csimplifying\u201d this is not actually done. The bank invests heavily on software, etc to make the client experience smoother however internally there is much to do to simplify - there are so many systems created that do not speak to each other. Many times we have to deal with large data where we spend hours trying to clean it up as a result . Processes at times are slow because of so many unnecessary systems not speaking to each other and so many work flow layers - think of an assembly line for a factory each line assembling one thing (literally). Sometimes software and systems should be created to ease particular work - this is not done to the extent that you think that your stuck in the 90s with the way these processes has not yet been updated.\r\n\r\nThe big clients are everything and if you do one tiny mistake like not respond to them even if it\u2019s way past working hours your questioned by everyone internally surprisingly the internal team will give you a harder time than the actual client itself.

Fear, worry, being questioned etc is always on the table.\r\n\r\nA lot of teams frequently change and this change brings about inconsistency and confusion - i.e. every time this team changes they change along with it the way things are done e.g. team one prefers a, b and c. Team two comes and say go back\r\nTo 3,21 - then team 3 comes back and says no we should do a,b,c again.\r\n\r\nBusiness team is the all knowing God for every known thing even the most irrelevant to them in the bank for some reason.
