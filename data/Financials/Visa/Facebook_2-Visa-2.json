There has been lots of back peddling witnessed over the past 3+ years to improve morale due to this rush to make changes, followed by subsequent, time consuming, employee initiatives rolled out to counteract/fix impactful decisions that caused low moral, poor annual company wide reviews/feedback and put a strain on retention  and recruiting."}, {"review_title": "Good company to work for", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It's a good company to work for.

While headed into a historically busy peak season, the company suddenly announced that it will be freezing the pension plan as of the end of 2015.

This was communicated in a couple of paragraphs in the lower portion of a running-on benefits update e-mail.  Obviously, the intent was to not call too much attention to this major change, but instead resulted in a huge backlash from the majority of employees.  Productivity was killed and left most wondering what the longer-term goals really are.  The company will hold the money, \u201cearning interest\u201d, until we leave or retire.  No rolling it to another plan for better growth. No additional contribution to 401\u2019s to make up for the substantial cut. No alternative.  \r\n\r\nOther cons: Promotions happen only once per year, just like Santa Claus.  You can forget about being promoted off-cycle, and the promotions that are available seem to be reserved for favorites who spent the entire year producing only the most vivid PowerPoint presentations.  There are some talented and motivated employees that are itching to do some great things, but people are kept in the trenches for years doing the same job. They are kept just enough out of visibility so that existing \u201cleadership\" can continue to flourish. Diversity is a joke, it seems that the one-hour presentation is done because it has to be as part of the HR script.  \r\n\r\nYou hope your colleagues and staff stick around, since the hiring process is arduous and complicated, requiring no less than seven interviews fully documented and two degrees from a short list of only the best schools for an entry-level position.

Nothing in life comes for free so it's anyone's guess how that machinery works!\r\n\r\n- Some teams (other than dev/QA) have attrition rates as high as 50%. No employee retention efforts are in place and the whole place works like a revolving door. The hiring process is always ongoing and everyone (including the skeletal HR) seems to be comfortable with a steady stream of exiting employees.\r\n\r\n- Employee engagement practices are an alien concept here and all relationships are totally transactional in nature. The mantra is to work, draw your paycheck and forget about everything else. If you ask about growth opportunities, you'll be bluntly asked to leave Visa.

Teamwork is restricted to just a very few teams with decent managers (less than 5% of teams). Management between teams is fully territorial, with people believing that their way is the only way and never cooperating as this would be seen as backing down from their own plans. \r\n\r\nThe morale and culture are the worst I've experienced. Top IT guy seems to believe his job is cheerleading, so there are 4-6 rah-rah meetings every month called \"All-Hands\". Hardly anyone even goes to these anymore, they have to send email to please sit up in the front for the cameras. These meetings always start 10-20 minutes late. (I mention these details not as the worst of the environment, but just as small examples to show how far the poor culture has seeped.)\r\n\r\nThere are at least 3, and often 10 or more, layers of project planners for each project.  Of course, all but two of these (the top layer and the bottom layer) are just playing the telephone game and regurgitating what they heard from below.  Often the actual source of the information  is not allowed at the meeting that reports it (to protect the middle manager jobs). So almost all meetings end up a waste of time, where people have to \"take things offline\" to go figure out the actual source and get the information directly. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking the VP and SVP layers are the worst of the non-value-adding staff. They don't want any decision made by others, so all meetings are hamstrung until the VP or SVP shows up to make a call. These VP's spend their days running from meeting to meeting pointing out the obvious. Since they are heavily overbooked (everyone needs them to move things forward, no delegation) they miss many meetings completely. This is accepted and implicitly excused as \"they are so busy\".\r\n\r\nTop execs rely on the annual HR survey for proof of the wonderful job they are doing. Everyone is pressured to complete the survey. Year after year the same areas are identified as poor performing areas -- but the next year and the year after that it is the same. Presentation of the results (at another All-Hands of course) is always marketing speak telling everyone how serious they are about changing these results.  \r\n\r\nNow it appears VIsa is putting pressure on at least a couple VP's to come to Glassdoor and promise better for the future.

Some managers literally lead by fear, and are rewarded because their direct reports deliver strong work. There is one employee engagement survey done annually, and seldom does anything happen to managers who receive bad ratings. When it comes time for compensation, 360 reviews are not considered, so managers are not incentivized to treat their direct reports like actual people. There are also no people management classes for managers, so those who receive poor ratings on the engagement review don\u2019t have any training or repercussions to their poor performance. \r\n\r\nEmphasis on Millennials: For a company that preaches an increased interest in recruiting millennials, there is absolutely no surveying or monitoring of millennials who recently joined Visa, with the exception of the New Graduate Development Program. As a new graduate who returned following a fantastic internship experience, I have had absolutely no external support from HR in terms of providing me with a mentor, offering any type of training beyond the normal 3-hour onboarding program, or any type of check-in about the transition from internship to full-time positions. They worked very hard to recruit us to come back full-time, but have made no effort to help facilitate, or even gain insights into, our transition into life at Visa. Many older employees feel as though the company is catering solely to young people, but this is just not the case in my experience. If you care about millennials and attracting young talent, act like it. It\u2019s extremely frustrating to have been recruited so heavily and then ignored upon arrival at the company and in addition, to listen to leadership talk about how Visa is a great place to young people to work and how they want to recruit young talent.\r\n\r\nNeed to Align Company Goals with Practices: Visa claims to be a tech company, and have a \u201cthink like a startup\u201d mentality\u2014this is an absolute joke. It\u2019s far too political and corporate to be a tech company, and cares much too little about employees to be a startup. It\u2019s one thing to preach in all hands that you care about employees, but it\u2019s another thing altogether to actually show that you value your employees. There is so much emphasis on the \u201cemployer of choice\u201d pillar, but nothing really behind it. Morale on some teams is very, very low, and not only is nothing being done, but nobody seems to really care. \r\n\r\nInconsistent Policies: The standards for several policies are wildly inconsistent across and even within functional departments; specifically, work from home (WFH), working remotely, and mobile phones. Within the same function, there will be teams with extremely different WFH/work remote policies, and the same is true for mobile phones. Some managers allow WFH with little to no notice, while some restrict the practice entirely. The BYOD program allows people to use their personal phones for work, but many teams allow employees to use a phone that Visa pays for in order to have constant access to email. There is no standard for any of these policies, and it is entirely up to manager discretion."}, {"review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Merchant Support in Lehi, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They treat you like an individual and they don't micro manage you.

The only internal promotions are reserved for senior managements' pets. You are more likely to be promoted for talking big and doing nothing, then busting your hump year over year.\r\n\r\nWe hear a lot about pushing for innovation, but it comes with the caveat that there is zero tolerance for failure. We also in theory have a 90/10 program that would allow employees to spend 10% of their time working on things that are not directly related to their position. It is meant to remove barriers and constraints to allow people to explore new ideas in a relatively unfettered way. The issue is that the Global Engineering group has so formalized it that innovation is handled as a project. It shows a complete lack of trust in employees because management has to make sure ever second of your 50+ hours a week is accounted for.\r\n\r\nWhile benefits are still decent, they are nothing like they were 5 - 6 years ago. At the trajectory they are on, I would expect Visa's benefits to be just as lackluster as anyone other company in the next 3 to 5 years.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of social activism in the company and nanny mentality. For example, we once had a chintzy free beverage program that allowed employees to get 3 free sodas or small bottles of water each day. A small group complained about the health and environmental impacts so they discontinued the program. Visa is also proud of being an LGBT employer of choice, but does not seem to see any value in being a top employer for working parents.

I read several other reviews that indicate a similar experience in Austin and now hope that this will lead to some sort of positive change.  I see that HR responds to these by saying to call a \"hotline\" which I did months before I wrote this ( August 2018).  This should be the first red flag.  To be fair, I will also say the Technology organization is divided into two different organizations.  One is, DMPD ( digital mobile product development) which likely doesn't have the same issues I am about to enumerate.\r\n\r\nLet me address why I gave everything one star ( except benefits) :\r\n\r\nCareer Opportunities :  I applied, interviewed and tested  for an internal position.  Was then  asked by the hiring manager to continue to the last phase of the process but was blocked by my current management.  No opportunity to learn and apply new tech, and I am not alone in this assessment.  This is an example of how they publish a policy about internal mobility but allow management to actively ruin your career.  Nobody has your back.\r\n\r\nCompensation :  Was lured in by a pension, but a few months later it was \"frozen\" i.e. canceled.  They are stingy with stock as well, and the ESPP is not great, as you are forced to hold shares for over a year which means several are under water right now.\r\n\r\nThey have a 10% 401K match but most the fidelity funds have lost money this year.  There is no fund above a morningstar rating of 3.\r\n \r\nTheir benefits are decent ( 4 weeks PTO ), and better than most any smaller company, but definitely not in the top tier.\r\n\r\nWork Life Balance :  This can be one of the worst things about Visa.  Working in Technology, the release process can be manual and antiquated.  Many career Visa employees are resistant to modernizing such processes.  Get ready to spend all weekend with little sleep doing a manual release.  It's not fun, and you don't learn anything.  Secondly, there is not good co-location and ownership with teams in some organizations including mine.  If you are in the US, you may find yourself being asked to attend meetings at all hours of the day and night, during lunch etc..  Can't get away for a workout and there is little flexibility in schedule.\r\n\r\nSenior Management : Every year, they have an annual survey, and the feedback on important items like having the tools to do your job is low and blatantly ignored ( every year).  Nothing meaningful is ever done,  They think making a better expense reporting mechanism, or ticketing system is \"good enough\".   The laptop you rely on to do your work is so bogged down by onerous security software and constant patching it's really tough to be efficient.   If you're lucky your laptop will be rebooted several times a week and sometimes take hours to become available again.  Otherwise, you'll end up taking it to IT for a long time.\r\n\r\nAlso,  the proxy server you are forced to use will block you from basic tools such as github and downloading simple eclipse plugins.  Blocking some sites makes sense, but basic stuff is not attainable with any reliability.\r\n\r\nCulture and Values :  This is the worst aspect of Visa.  It is the least diverse workplace I've ever been a part of.  It's a top down sort of arrangement where your manager suddenly tells you to do 5 different things out of the blue, because his/her manager told them to make you do this.

But i was content that this will be good opportunity as they had recently started this center and everything looked glam from the office to the fun at work culture. (Point to note: Subsidized lunch started only recently and transport will start from 15th of next month [this is what we have been hearing from past 6-8 months]).\r\nInitially while interacting with other colleagues within O&I, it came to light that everyone had a hard time negotiating with the HR for hike. [HR (for laterals at least) has been outsourced to INFOSYS and they did not leave any stone unturned to make laterals beg for each a penny]. \r\nHearing about this I (at least the human inside) was happy until I came to know other laterals in other department (VDP, DMPD etc.) for the same years of experience have got much more than us in O&I (AT LEAST 150%). I consoled myself giving the logic that they have different skill set and we are cost center for the company while they are the cash cow.\r\nBut the nails in coffin happen to be the info about the salaries of fresher joining from college. Let me give you an insight here (for O&I of course). The salaries for laterals with 2-4 years: 5.5L-8L; 4-8 years: 8L-12L. Now, the salaries for fresher, IITs-22+ L, NITs \u2013 12-14+L and others >8L (6+ L for few colleges). \r\nLet me clarify I have nothing against the fresher but the idiotic decision makers who thought this would be good experiment to observe human behavior when people are kept under dire circumstances. \r\nThink of the situation that we have to give KT and teach the fresher while know that they earn way more than what we are earning. We should not be feeling this but it seems they mock us at our back and even feel pity for us.                \r\nThe reason I am writing this is to make the HR department realize if you not normalize the salaries (if rumors are to be believed it has been done for VDP who were way better off than us) then I don\u2019t see why there would not be 30% alteration in O&I.  \r\nAnd the micro managing the employee by the O&I local boss is not helping your cause.

This has seemingly put external applicants at a preferred status.\r\n\r\n-If you accept a role in the call center, especially as an agent, do not expect to move into other departments.  You will be lucky if you move forward into higher positions within the contact center.  Leadership is still trying to bridge the gap between having contract workers and full-time employees.

Visa was a great place to work.  For many new hires, it probably remains a great place to work.  For longer term employees, the future seems bleak.  There are a few self-serving senior managers masquerading as leaders who are corrupt, bending the rules, and leaving everyone afraid to speak up.  No doubt, corporate mandates influenced by stockholders are now driving policy and errant behavior.....but that doesn't excuse management complicity.  Employees are key stakeholders too, and you're giving them the shaft!!\r\n\r\nThe first Dirty Secret:   If an employee is nearing the 10/50 retirement option, he/she is likely a target for \"realignment.\"  Seniority and tenure appear to be devalued, and highly skilled and knowledgeable employees are getting pushed out the door with hush-money severance packages.  Payroll reduction and payroll \"restructuring\" is the oldest trick in the book to demonstrate improved corporate performance. It's one of the most desperate and insidious corporate performance improvement tools at a company's disposal.  The 10/50 retirement package is an legacy program and abused \"policy\".  Suggesting that a specific and arbitrary age is a retirement perk, in today's world, is a class action suit waiting to happen.\r\n\r\nThe second Dirty Secret:  The new 1-4 performance rating system is a setup.  Performance issues have always been an easy way to facilitate an employee's \"departure.\"   Visa is an \"at will\" company and there is no hesitation to restate this fact behind closed doors.  To add insult to injury, the outdated and draconian Performance Improvement Plan is an absolute farce.  Senior managers are abusing and manipulating the PIP, under HR's guidance, to weed out employees in the most unethical way conceivable.   Attention HR......a 50% PIP success rate is no better than chance.  Get real!!   \r\n\r\nIn addition, HR and Legal appear to believe the performance allegations and press of senior managers.   HR and Legal are unwittingly condoning and excusing the behavior.  Both groups are blind to the PERJURY and false performance claims of a select few.  Yes....lies and fraud are hiding in plain sight!!   Handing oversight and final judgement of an employees \"poor performance\" to the same manager responsible for the train wreck is an employee's death warrant.  \r\n\r\nHaving the \"fox guard the chicken coop\" is an egregious and Machiavellian form of employee negligence and abuse.  Any manager with true leadership qualities and any shred of accountability would never guide an employee to a low rating that leads to potential discharge.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts.  Permitting such behavior makes Visa's own written code of conduct and business ethics appear to be shallow and vacuous marketing material only.  \r\n\r\nHR's commentary when confronted with such concerns.......... and this statement is in their own words:  \"...........but, It's not illegal\"   Excuse the cynicism....but does that make it okay!!??  The bar has been set very low for what is considered acceptable and ethical behavior.  \r\n\r\nYes, this is ALL documented and recorded, but nobody would believe it if they heard it with their own ears or saw it with their own eyes.  For the courageous few who are willing to comment, there are bound to be more reviews like this."}, {"review_title": "Lots of turnover, that does not seem to be stopping", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people, and the work is interesting.", "cons": "New management and the resulting turnover makes for poor morale.
