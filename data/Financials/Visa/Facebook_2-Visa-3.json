Engineering is mostly filled with sub-par engineers with minimal skills that were contractors with some IT bodyshop at one point and got converted to employees.  Most of your time is spent dealing with internal politics or drama with very little interest from your peers about actual work. \r\n\r\nCulture - Peers are super nice to each other but will speak negatively behind your back with great ease. Every one shares everyone else's compensation, performance ratings, upcoming promotions, family matters freely without any concern for privacy or feelings.  This is across all levels of the company, all the way to top management. Most people hang out in groups to socialize with peers that speak the same language. \r\n\r\nStrategy - As an engineering org, there is no sense of direction There is absolutely no strategy from the top that cascades down to the front-line employees. All-hands meetings are a joke. \r\n\r\nProcess Burden - Processes are archaic and there is little interest in changing anything. Most employees are stuck with long immigration waits and are bullied into working long hours and weekends. Things that are done in a matter of hours or are automated in the rest of the industry take weeks or months here. There is absolutely no respect for work-life balance. You are expected to answer texts, phone calls, IMs at any hour of the day or you are considered to be not committed or hard-working.\r\n\r\nFocus - There is also always some new flavor of the month. Some new security tool gets introduced that opens up a bunch of findings on your application and you \r\nspend the next 2 months chasing those findings. Or there is some massive migration effort that your org needs to undergo and you spend most of your year just moving all your applications and data to a cheaper vendor. You are then questioned on why you didn't get anything important done.\r\n\r\nMorale - Most mid-level management got beat up due to poor employee survey numbers last year. Managers spent most of their energy in addressing engagement issues versus getting anything real done. Individual contributors were asked to be more engaged and that was the end of it. Apparently this year, it is not a priority anymore and somehow things have made a 180 in terms of engagement. \r\n\r\nGrowth - When it comes to career growth, promotions are done mostly on favoritism or tenure (need to be around for decades) and there are no formal career paths. Internal Mobility is talked about all the time but there are no protections. You apply for a role and you would be lucky if you even hear back from the hiring manager in months. You are then told eventually that the position was opened to fill an internal promotion.\r\n\r\nPerformance Reviews - The performance review process is a big mess as well. Visa uses stack ranking and will force your manager to put someone on the top or worse, below every year. Then HR forces then their 'curves' and the rating that you get is something else altogether than what you were expecting or deserved.

The quality of your work or products don't really matter and performance rating criteria are subjective and vague. If a senior person on your team doesn't like you (which happens fairly regularly) its very easy for them to nullify your bonus and further more destroy your career. Upper management is too busy wining and dining with other corporate executives to ever look at the products that are created. This gives significant power to senior team members that have huge sway because managers inherently trust everything they say, even if its blatantly wrong.\r\n\r\nWork Life Balance is totally off, if you have a wife, kids or a pet, good luck you wont be seeing much of them if you work at Visa. I guess this could be a plus if you don't like being at home.\r\n\r\nLots of old blood in this company which treats new employees poorly. As a new team member be prepared to be stabbed in the back multiple times and expect the more \"seasoned\" employees to attempt to make you look bad at best or fired at worst.\r\n\r\nVP and Director level leadership give very little guidance or vision of what they'd like your team to achieve, so team leads are left guessing as to what they need to accomplish. Half of work time in team meetings is spent arguing about what course or action to take and guessing at what leadership may or may not like. Ineffective.\r\n\r\nInstead of having sane work hours and expectations, leadership decides its a good idea to treat employees out to all you can drink fests every once in a while as a way to \"recharge.\" \r\n\r\nMost employees don't utilize their vacation time as it is seen by mid-high level leadership as disloyalty to your team. Team production will obviously suffer because they don't have enough employees in the first place.\r\nThe company used to have a retirement plan that it advertised to all its new recruits as being one of the best draws to working at Visa. A lot of new talent was recruited under this pretense and the retirement plan was eliminated to save money for the company at the same time Visa was spending billions to acquire Visa Europe.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this company fosters a toxic work environment and if your unfortunate enough to find yourself working here vigilantly watch your back, especially when around the \"seasoned\" employees.

Many Managers cannot even create a power point slide. Some use note pad to refer to key words. Many dont show up at meetings after lunch and prefer napping at home than driving to work.\r\nTechnical Managers or Directors think programming is a tool for developers as Email is a tool for themselves. Some think coding is scary and has to be done by the lowlife immigrants who are starving for a job. \r\nIf VISA conducts a basic proctored exam for managers and directors , I would say 100% failure rate in solving technical problems will be evident . Visa is a finance company but never a technology company. You will never find any DIRECTOR from Ivy League schools, rather the most preferred species are South Asian  - especially Indian ,Pakistan and some Russians dominating the mid-management. Delegating work and being offline is the learning curve for directors. Converting contractors to full time is another lovable job they do perfectly. \r\n\r\nPlease refrain from working under any South Asian Boss in VISA, Not only they will screw your career , but also they will mislead you to be unskilled. They will loathe you , your work and aggressively kill your dreams as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nDiversity Terrorism is what they excel at and Dumb is the least describing word found to be describing them. Some directors are so dumb they think JAVA is an island in Indonesia. These clown monkeys have never ever written a \"Hello World\" program in their life.  Well this is Silicon Valley where --- Dumb Gets Better and Better gets Bankrupt . \r\n\r\nSo please go ahead and join a startup with less salary, less benefits but your learning curve will sharpen and you will feel the respect.

TAKE A LOOK AT OTHER REVIEWS here, they all pretty much have the same grievances...\r\n\r\n- Middle management almost takes pride in how POLITICAL the company is. They sit in meetings all day but the heavy lifting is hardly ever done. Ask for any kind of documentation or background information for your projects and they will proudly tell you everything lives in people's heads. Good luck getting it out!\r\n\r\n- WEAK LEADERSHIP all the way up to the top with a C-suite that is ANTIQUATED and out of touch and global heads that are completely removed from the realities of what goes on at the ground level. Not surprising from a company that has the HQ in SF (for top management only) while the actual farm is 30 miles south.\r\n\r\n- Over-filled with DINOSAURS that have been with the company for 10-20 years, have advanced to roles they are neither qualified for nor have the discipline, intelligence or skill to execute or manage others in their groups. FAVORITISM to the max, hardly a mertiocracy. People seem to grow based on how well they play the POLITICAL GAME rather than true hard work.\r\n\r\n- UNPROFESSIONAL middle management that would make a hooker blush with the amount of profanity, lack of diplomacy and tact that can be observed in daily meetings and around the cubes.\r\n\r\n- SINK OR SWIM environment - you will get no onboarding, no help and no development for your job. Pray that it fits exactly with what you bring to the table or you're screwed!\r\n\r\n- A company that woke up one day and decided they are becoming a nimble tech startup. Wrong! They are stuck in the days of an overly STUFFY CULTURE with arcane, BUREAUCRATIC procedures, SLOW moving and a general LACK OF EMPOWERMENT for decision making, etc. A $1 mm investment should not require the CFOs signoff for a company that makes billions every year!\r\n\r\n- Generally a very DEPRESSING, dark and sad place to work. It is obvious that many PEOPLE HATE THEIR JOBS (some are even vocal about it) and only stay for either lack of options or because of the pay. The elevated frustration creates an environment where people are RUDE, unhelpful, and backstabbing.\r\n\r\n- To make things worse, the Washington of the corporate world has acquired 2 other businesses that is trying to integrate with little true strategy or success. The only success so far: more politics!\r\n\r\n- The payment processing industry is extremely mundane, DULL and needlessly complex. Those that know it will always throw their weight around by overcomplicating the technical aspect in order to maintain control while those that don't act like they do making things even more confusing. \r\n\r\n- For a company that moves as SLOW as Visa, and where so little true progress is made, WORK-LIFE BALANCE IS TERRIBLE! This is a direct result of lack of prioritization from the top down, the politics and bureaucracy. Absolutely NO TASK here is done in an EFFICIENT, straight-forward way.\r\n\r\n- Although the Visa network is mainly in autopilot mode everyone is constantly agitated and stressed out trying to justify their existence and paycheck. Everything to the smallest, most ridiculous task is a priority and gets excessive attention until the next thing comes up. The biggest joke on campus is \"if everyone at Visa took the month off, nothing would change\".

Bureaucratic and painfully slow process for getting new or more up to date software adopted with outsourced corporate IT and their Visa counterparts often just passing the buck when things go wrong.\r\n\r\nRecruitment and promotion decisions biased and non-transparent. In the annual employee satisfaction survey year after year the transparency of progression persistently keeps being one of 3 or 4 lowest-scoring items (incidentally, no attempt has ever been made to address this perception).\r\n\r\nVery \"top heavy\" with some managers managing only one or two employees. \r\n\r\nPoor processes for leadership selection resulted with system where drinking with the right people matters more than any other skills one may have. Thanks to inadequate career progression framework some people with neither any discernible people skills nor knowledge of their particular area got promoted to managerial roles and in process ended up demotivating their teams safe in the knowledge their chums will protect them when things go wrong.\r\n\r\nPoor decision making - many mid-ranking managers seemingly disempowered and unable to do anything without referring to the ones higher up the chain.\r\n\r\nDespite the organisation being heavily dependent on IT, technical proficiency is treated with disdain. If an individual gets branded as \"technical\" (as in \"oh, he/she is so technical\") this in Visa parlance means their progression up the career ladder is pretty much a lost cause. \"Technical\" as pejorative term, that's a really strange attitude.\r\n\r\nThey pay lip service to Agile development and in reality end up overburdening everyone with ever-growing bureaucracy. Their default solution to any problem a project may encounter is just to throw more money and even more project managers at it, thus increasing confusion and lack of accountability until it eventually grinds to a halt.\r\n\r\nRecent round of redundancies has been managed very ineptly. A number of talented individuals have been treated so badly in process that they decided to leave the organisation on their own even though Visa had intended to keep them.

Leaders are more concerned with empire building/ maintenance than the greater good of the company or their teams.\r\n\r\n2) A squandered opportunity through a botched \r\nreorganisation and redundancy programme\r\n\r\nThe arrival of a new CEO was the opportunity to clean up under-performing leaders (easily identified) and start afresh. Instead, rife were instances of the inept retaining their jobs or, in many cases, rising. What message does this give?\r\n\r\nThe restructure and redundancy programme were woefully mis-managed: poor CEO engagement (\"I'm not here to make friends\" was one nugget) and a nonsense organisational structure (several \"at risk\" teams were suddenly realised to be vital; responsibilities were not clearly defined resulting in much confusion). The process lasted most of 2014 and created a depressing working environment. I don't think many can truthfully say the outcome changed things for the better.\r\n\r\n3) A culture of bullying left unchecked\r\n\r\nAgain, present in most companies. Most striking is the apparent frequency of abhorrent treatment of direct reports by managers. Line managers have complete power over your destiny and can use the performance management system with impunity without any checks/balances to ensure fairness.\r\n\r\nBlatantly unfair or preferential treatment of direct reports is widely observed and yet overlooked. Competent, ambitious people are often seen as a threat to management and are put down. Unfortunately, much of this comes down to a HR function without teeth, focusing more on the administrative side of their role rather than being a trusted partner to the business.\r\n\r\n4) Lack of commercial focus/ mindedness\r\n\r\nWhilst giving rise to some of the pros listed, it is also a significant weakness. A firm focus on the bottom line could quell much of the politics and align the interests of leaders with the firm's interests. A leader worried about achieving ambitious targets has less capacity for self-serving politics and delinquent behaviour and a corporate scorecard result significantly above 100% every year surely points to easy targets.

As a result we have lost good staff, whilst retaining some less effective souls who are not equipped for the journey ahead. We should have offered them a other option. This has manifested itself in some areas where staff with poor interpersonal skills or leadership qualities have been promoted over more capable staff. Often this appears to have occurred due to relationships with more senior management or just the individual's ability to be a 'yes man or woman'. The result is distrust, loathing and in some cases bullying of staff by the less than inspirational leaders we now have in some teams.\r\nStaff are being treated to pay freezes and reduced bonuses whilst senior staff see financial rewards grow. The board recognised Visa's performance this year by giving it a rating of 160%. A large portion of the excs bonus is based on this, and next year their on target bonus will grow by 30%, whilst the rest of us are marked down so our share of the success is reduced. Staff have been through a lot in 2014 and certinaly do not feel we are all in this together, which is resulting in low moral and poor engagement.
