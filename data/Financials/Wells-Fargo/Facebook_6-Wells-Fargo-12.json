I was a top performer for consecutive appraisal cycles. One fine day out of the blue with got to know in a call that our LOB is shutting down as Wells Fargo was pulling out of that business. Given the fact that I am among the top few, I had a false expectation that I am an asset to the company and most of us will be fitted to other requirements elsewhere in the company. But that never happened, a day after that call India management told us they are not sure what's gonna happen. On top of that there were no openings it seemed internally, so the only unsaid option we had was to move out. Now, most people in our team gradually did move out by getting jobs in other companies but there was zero support from management and HR to even try and get us an internal opening. In the mean time they were hiring new candidates from outside parallelly. \r\nNot a single question was answered and a template answer was always provided telling that there is a lack of clarity. When people were resigning, initially they didnt even ask the reason and the top performers were the first to get jobs outside but surprisingly they were asked to pay if they wanted to leave early, now the situation was either to stay without any assurity about your job, or pay some amount to get an early release so that you can join a new company, WOW! . Few people who did not end up getting jobs were ultimately handed pink slips by end of 2020 without one proper oppurtunity. Worst part was, after a month of all of us leaving, we get to see job openings being posted on Job portals and also getting mails from recruiters for requirements on the same skill set which we had. If as a top performer in a company I have to go through this that too during times of COVID then imaging the kind of ethics the management has who decide to let go of existing top perfoming employees and hire new people in a 2 hour interview on the same skill set.

It is now trying everything it can to get rid of as many US employees in technology as possible and replace them with offshore employees at a fraction of the cost. The pandemic has only made this trend worse.\r\n\r\nThe experiment started about 7 years ago. Two separate management chains, which only diverge about a level or two below the CEO. Offshore is completely unaccountable to anyone in the US, and their performance is abysmal. US employees take the blame for their mistakes and often have to work extra to fix them.\r\n\r\nWells has always had a bad time managing underperforming employees. Employees who routinely do the jobs of 3 or more people are never promoted or given raises, while those who do nothing climb the ladder quickly. With offshore, that is magnified 10 times. Most offshore managers only care to increase their headcounts, with no regard for actual delivery of work. The project I work on has steadily collapsed under their weight, as every US employee who leaves is replaced by 3 offshore employees who do literally nothing, if you are lucky. I have \"coworkers\" who haven't made a single check-in in over 3 years. They are being promoted.\r\n\r\nWhat we are now seeing is most of the valuable US employees being given negative performance reviews, including those who have literally done the work of 7 people for more than 5 years. Management does not care. They have targets to meet, and they will meet them.\r\n\r\nIt is abundantly clear the Wells Fargo is moving to a 100% offshore technology model at the expense of its US employees. We get no bonuses. We get no new hires. They get tons of bonuses for no work, and always seem to have new job reqs opening.\r\n\r\nIt. Is. Hell. Here.

Then WF bought us out and that was when I discovered what being in hell was like. They put on the mask like they were changing the company for the good but in reality employees were overworked and underpaid. The turnover was higher then any other company I have worked at. This was due to a combination of things, one was that new hires were not given enough training to feel confident to do the job, others could not keep up with the fast pace, some realized that the sales part of the job was the entire job and was lacking the customer service we were supposed to be giving. Then you have others being termed for mistakes, a lot were probably due to lack of training and or coaching so instead of coaching the employees they normally just termed them. The growth oppt. was very little unless you wanted to go from a teller to a sales position and manager only if another leaves. Don't even consider lead teller because the salary was barely higher then the teller. I recall countless times were entire stores were being termed due to gaming. I also recall countless times were others were sabotaging each other. The leaders acted more like ditators then partners. They would work against you instead of with you and thought that talking to everyone like they were a child would gain respect. The sales goals expected from the employees in every position were so unrealistic and over the top that I can see why so many were not interested in staying. Most would go work at other banks altogether where they could focus on the customer rather than focus on what else they can sell to them. After so many years of seeing this all unfold I felt that being in an environment where everyone around me was so toxic was not healthy. The above things that I shared were not things happening to me, these were observations and when I see things being done over and over and nothing ever changes (even when we have spoke up about it) then sometimes its better to move on. I decided to pursue other ventures. Leaving that company was the biggest weight off of my shoulders ever.
