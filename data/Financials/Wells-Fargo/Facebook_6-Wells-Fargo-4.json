Some of the funds charge above $5.00 per thousand invested. \r\n\r\n- The 401K match is only provided one time per year on December 15th. If you quit, are fired or retire before 12-15 of any given year, you get zero match.\r\n\r\n- The new \"senior leadership\" has developed a quota system for performance review outcomes. This means, generally, thirty five to forty percent of employees will receive a 1 or 2 out of 5. This was published internally in a power point presentation to managers when the new performance plan system was rolled out to employees. \r\n\r\n- You are not a \"team member\" you are an \"employee\" and just like printers and computer equipment, you can be replaced at any time. Good performer for 15 years before Charlie Scharf and his crew took over? Does not matter. \r\n\r\n- In some cases, direct supervisors have been forced to downgrade and change their performance assessment at the direction of managers who did not directly supervise nor directly witness the performance of team members work. My immediate supervisor told me \"it was not my decision\" when at mid-year I had a stellar review and suddenly at year end - not so stellar. \r\n\r\n- Kristy Fercho, Executive Vice President and Head of Wells Fargo Home Lending, decided to use a not-so-original mantra to constantly throw around to the mortgage team. COMPETE - each letter representing a catch word. She got the idea from the coach of Duke University's women's basketball team, which is hilarious because Duke University's women's basketball team isn't even in the top 20. Please! Get a successful hero. \r\n\r\n- Diminishing options for health and other insurance packages (unless you're an insider exec, of course.) \r\n\r\n- Cost cutting measures include not replacing FTEs so when folks finally decide this isn't the Wells Fargo that it used to be, those who stay, get more work - and the same pay. \r\n\r\n-Speaking of pay, never expect more than about 2.5% increase and those will be annual only and will not repeat every year.  Always expect a song and dance about why times are tough and we can\u2019t do better this year. (That story DOES repeat every year.)\r\n\r\n- While the rest of the businesses across the country are recruiting by offering very flexible telework schedules as part of their benefits, Wells Fargo is stupidly demanding everyone be in the office a minimum of 3 days per week. No matter what your previous telework agreement was in March 2020 when the pandemic started. \r\n\r\n- One more thing. When business is booming in the mortgage processing and underwriting teams, the company has had a history of demanding employees work \"mandatory overtime\" on Saturdays. So, if you wanted to not work on a Saturday, you had to actually take Paid Time Off that you previously earned - that's right - you couldn't turn down \"overtime work\" without taking your hard earned leave. \r\n\r\nNeed I provide more reasons not to work at this company?

They're not fooling anybody.\r\n- Awful code quality process. There's a checklist of requirements that changes constantly for reasons nobody can specify. Things don't get deployed until the entire application is completely finished, which in software engineering means never. Nothing is ever finished. This results in deployments of massive chunks of code, which we all know is more risky than deploying completed bits and pieces.\r\n- Forcing employees to come into the office when the teams they work on are spread across the globe. So employees go into the office for \"face time\" on Skype and Teams. A stated reason for making everyone go back into the office was so we can chit chat and build professional relationships with people not on our team, but of course nobody's given the time to do that. You're booked constantly with meetings so every bit of non meeting time you get you dedicate to doing your work. Also not everybody is interested in chit chatting with people they don't work with. In short they only want you back into the office because, unlike smart managers, they care about the time your butt is in the seat not the work you get done.\r\n- extremely unstable development environments. \r\n- Excessive amount of documentation, duplicate documentation, and out of date documentation\r\n- 200 hour SLAs. Really? SLA? There's no reason to have this anymore. And did I mention 200 hours?! Just get the ticket and work on it! Most of the \"engineers\" that pick up these tickets are off shore, and on multiple occasions they waited until the 200 hours is almost up to start work on the ticket, but they don't know what to do so they \"work\" on it and then immediately mark it as done thereby resetting the 200 hours. Of course they aren't real developers so they don't know what to do, but now they're given an additional 200 hours to complete their work. They do all of this without once reaching out to the person who made the request. Very unprofessional.\r\n- Dev teams are told we MUST do agile (even though it's not agile) so we're all working on 2 week sprints, yet every little thing we want to do outside of our local machine requires a 200 hour SLA ticket to be submitted. I'm not that good at math, but 200 hours is way longer than 2 weeks.\r\n- Everything requires a stupid ticket, which has a 200 hour SLA attached to it. And the \"developers\" that pick up these tickets have no idea what they're doing. You need to call them and walk them through exactly what to do or else they won't know, but you're not allowed to do it yourself. Not even in the dev environment. This is how I had to instruct one of the \"devs\", \"You need to go to this URL. Ok, now click on login. You need to enter your credentials. No I can't see what your password is so you can go ahead and type it in the password input field.\" I wish this is a joke, but it is not. And what did this \"developer\" need to do that I had to give such detailed basic instructions? He needed to update environment variables, which should've taken no longer than 5 minutes, but they took the entire 200 hour SLA to complete this task... It's sad.\r\n-"}, {"review_title": "Great Experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "31 May 2022", "job_title": "Business Development Representative in Tempe, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great experience and you are introduce to some much in this role.", "cons": "I do not have any Cons."}, {"review_title": "Nice place to work at", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work Life balance and work culture", "cons": "Nothing found to list on"}, {"review_title": "Great company and team work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great treat work and training", "cons": "There is no part time opening position"}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Loan Officer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "No complaints.
