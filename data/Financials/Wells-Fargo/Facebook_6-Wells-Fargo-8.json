Prior to the scandal the bank\u2019s leadership outside of consumer banking had much more authority and the banks ability to be competitive was fun and winning meaningful relationships and positively impacting customers was commonplace. After the scandal became the central focus it was a completely different work place for all areas of the bank which 95% of the bank had nothing to do with the account scandal. The former leader of the consumer side of the business and her unquestioned support from the CEO of the bank at that time was the downfall for this organization.", "cons": "The bank lost its direction after the account scandal broke. No one employee including the CEO (he was in denial) really understood the changes that would be forthcoming once the effects of this fully took effect. The bank no longer was in control of its narrative nor was it capable of communicating to its employees what was going on with its regulatory enforcements that never stopped coming. Being an employee at Wells Fargo is not something I would recommend to anyone in the next few years unless you are looking for mission impossible and your work will never culminate into a feeling of satisfaction. My role was the tip of the spear in helping the bank bring in new customer relationships. As part of the banks effort to appease a multitude of its regulatory issues, the bank set up a number of safety towers or silos (operating separately of one another). This sounds like it was a good idea, but because the leaders of these various silos operated independently of each other and did not communicate it was a complete nightmare to get anything done productive and help create positive outcome. The time it took to board a new relationship is typically many months and not weeks as most banks board new clients. The culture of the bank has become one of fear and uncertainty. By in large there are fewer senior experienced bankers working as they are leaving for other opportunities. By in large, turnover is not occurring in higher salaried enployees despite the dysfunction because they won\u2019t have someone pay them what they make at WF. The higher paid employees typically comprised of senior leadership are under tremendous pressure as their top performers are running over them getting out the door."}, {"review_title": "Systems QA Analyst", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Systems QA Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work Life Balance and Flexibility", "cons": "Not much Learning.

If you work in a department, and then get hired in a different department, but it is considered a lateral move, you will make your same pay. That is okay until you find out that if the department decides to have a departmental increase, you will not receive the pay increase since you were not \"promoted\". This means that a new person who have no prior experience at that level or a new hire to Wells will make more than a person who might have decided to change departments but remained at the same level.

I felt mostly prepared going into the role but once I was on the floor taking calls I realized quickly how much had been left out. There were a great deal of important job functions that weren't covered in training that I and the others who trained with me had to ask coworkers about. \n\nTime on the phones and time in general was very micromanaged down to the minute. If you spent too long on a call or too long in wrap it was only a matter of time until someone was on the case about it no matter how reasonable it was or how detailed the notes were. This isn't necessarily true of the company as a whole but in my role with my boss I felt as though my failures were recognized disproportionately to my successes.\n\nAt the time that I was working with Wells Fargo the company was in the news a lot for any number of scandals. We were always being emailed about them and briefed on how to respond if certain things came up in conversation, or how to redirect them to a team geared to speak with the media and things like that. It was frustrating having to keep on top of it all, especially when most of it had nothing to do with my role whatsoever.\n\nLastly, collections for home mortgage was just a distressing job. That isn't Wells Fargo's fault but it's true of the role even so. It was difficult to hear people talk about the massive obstacles in their life getting in the way of them paying their home loan and hearing their distress in being told they're at risk of losing their home if they don't pay, and there's only so much we as employees can do about that. Being unable to help people beyond a certain extent when their only wrongdoing is not having money to live on felt terrible and acknowledging that on the floor felt like an admission of weakness. I felt like \"the bad guy\" a lot.

Many senior RM staff are simply there because they cannot find another job and will make your life very difficult. Throwing underlings under the bus is a regular occurrence and promotion is based on politics and desperation to get someone to stay that has told management they are leaving. \n\n2: Career Development: There is none unless you are extremely lucky. Trying to move to different groups will often not be allowed and management can deny your transfer for any reason. After this you will be marked as not \u201cloyal\u201d and you essentially have no future. Few, if any of the things you will do will be transferable to real finance jobs so your time in the position will be viewed by other employers as little better then unemployment. Trying to better yourself through school or programs such as the CFA or CAIA is highly discouraged and can lead to outright retaliation in some cases. \n\nPay: You will be paid 25-40% less then the same job at other banks and will be paid 30-50% less then what you would make on the principal side in a finance position.
