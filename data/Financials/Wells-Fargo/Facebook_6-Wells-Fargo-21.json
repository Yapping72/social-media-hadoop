So according to the general public a banker is to help people financially but that is not true. They hire you as salesmen(to hustle customers). Basically, managers want you to lie to customers and tell them they need new accounts when actually you don't. For example, around November 2011 Wells Fargo(WF) changed their accounts on how they waive the fee. Most people had a Complete Advantage which was waived with a $75 transfer from checking to savings. After November, WF did away with the transfer to waive the fee and made it only where you need $7500 in the account or have it link to a home mortgage or else you would incur a fee. Instead bankers would LIE, i repeat, LIE to customers and say they have to change the account in whole when in the system all you had to do was convert it to a lower account to not incur fees. They caused confusion and a hassle for customers when they just had to do a simple conversion. The reason why bankers(salesmen) don't convert products is because the bankers want to get the sale. Most managers and District managers didnt want you to do this(wink,wink). Okay, i'm being sarcastic. They know this is going on and they have a blind eye and they too want to get the sale. \r\n\r\nThis company is sooo sales focused on sales they really will do anything just to hit goal. Yes the company will promote but they promote bad behavior, they will only promote people who produce the most sales and not really quality sales. Most bankers who do quality work are lower on sales and they get yelled at for having low sales(WF calls it solutions). I've seen numerous bankers quit because they are passed up by shady bankers.\r\n\r\nTo name a few sales tactics shady bankers do:\r\n-create fake people using(no social security number is required to open an account) saying they are from a foreign country. They use a friend or family members address. They sign the document them self and fund the account with their own money. They withdrawal when they get the debit card or just transfer it over to a new account when they do this cycle all over again.\r\n\r\n-as mentioned above, they lie to customer to get new accounts.\r\n\r\n-Put people in the wrong products to get a higher profit proxy(putting them in a higher tier account). this looks better and bankers have a profit they have to hit. to customers it just means after three months they incur a fee and they complain about it.\r\n\r\n-Creating a fake business and say its a doing a business as. pretty much dont need a business licence because they put the business under a sole prop. and the account will go through. they do this to get more profit.\r\n\r\n-Bankers will open numerous accounts under friends and family just to hit goal. im talking about 4 checking and 4 savings just so their numbers look good. Im sure you have had a friend who worked at WF ask you to open an account.\r\n\r\nThe company really doesnt care how you get the sale(solutions) just as long as the results are there. The company will promote these people and try to force it on the new hires. its pretty muchif you have my back and get this done, then you will be on my good side. if you refuse, you will quit because you will hate it here. Everyday i swear its a new day and if you dont hit goal, its the END of the WORLD. if you somehow did good today its like great job but if you dont tomorrow, EVERYONE FREAK OUT!!\r\n\r\nIt short, the company cares about results only. They promotes bad behavior. They care less about the employee ethical standpoint. Personal Bankers in Wells Fargo is not a real banker position. \r\n\r\nOh yeah when it comes to customer service, they are so up tight about it freak out if you dont have a greeter. they are paid to get customer service. anything but all fives is a failure. if you get all 5's and one 4. you really will get yelled at and written up. the survey is based on 5 questions ranging from 1-5. ill tell you this, i got one 4 and i had a two hour talk with my manager. This was not kool because i know the customer and the customer was someone who came in because another banker lied to the customer and i had to fix it. it just so happen i got the survey and i had the customer thanking me and fully satisfied with my service. i still get yelled at. \r\n\r\nIf you work for this company, please do not work in retail. do something. i have more to say but i really am tired of typing so much."}, {"review_title": "Overall it is a great company but this was a developing business line and there were some issues.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Feb 2013", "job_title": "Accounting Specialist in Bloomington, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This was a growing business line for Wells Fargo and offered growth opportunities and a variety of different challenging experiences.", "cons": "As it was a developing business line they were changing processes and implementing a new software that had not been fully tested.

Based in an affluent neighborhood getting 2 checking accounts per day can be next to impossible. Really we have come to the point where we have to sell \"internet checking accounts,\" \"travel checking accounts,\" and don't forget the \"bill pay account\" None of these lead to customer loyalty which is ultimately what banking is about. The fact of the matter is that Wealthy clients will stay with a bank based on customer service and rates, not having eight products which include online banking, bill pay and a debit card. I have seen more money flow out of the bank due to low rates than I have seen new accounts open. Management encourages poor behavior by rewarding those who game the system. The only problem with this is that I wonder how much money this bank loses due to the fact that checking accounts get opened and closed on a quarterly basis. If someone loses a check, guess what that's a new account even though every banker knows they transfer account. Having trouble with overdrafts. Let's close out your old account and open up  a new one so we can start with a clean slate. Lost a debit card, let's close it out and order a new one, solution. You're in college and and your broke, have you thought about opening up a bill pay account. Never mind that you can't keep track of one let's open up another one, that we'll close out once you overdraft it. Have a relative who lives in another country that you barely know. Lets set up an  express  send, Solution! Have a savings account that earns a lower rate, well let's close that one out and open up a higher earning savings account, Solution. Oh and don't forget to jump into January, where you'll absolutely have to annoy you're friends and family by opening up 10 accounts on January 1st, but it's cool you'll close them out at the start of the quarter and they'll never receive fees. Management we'll love you, throw you  a party and the company as a whole will lose money as these new accounts will never be used, what a waste of paper, checks, and data storage space.
