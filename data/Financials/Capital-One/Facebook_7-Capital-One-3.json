This will determine not only your bonus, but also when you will likely be promoted next and salary increases, so it's pretty important. \r\n\r\nAt Capital One, this is process is known as calibration sessions. All the managers under a senior director get in a room and they are given a certain percentage of who can be rated as exceptional, very strong, strong, and needs improvement. . \r\n\r\nThere is little regard for the reality of how the employees are actually performing objectively. Astonishingly, the managers work backwards from the same distribution no matter where you are in the company (no I'm not joking) and try to fit all the employees into that, leading to some cases of exceptional employees being under rated, or struggling employees being rated as strong. \r\n\r\n Your rating will be determined by other managers who you have little opportunity to interact with on a daily basis, and will heavily depend on how much political clout your manager has. Astoundingly, there is little to no consideration put on the opinion of your teammates who would know the most about your contributions.\r\n\r\nWhat this results in is a sort of hunger games culture where you can only do better by having those who work closely with you to do poorly. As you can imagine pitting teams and employees against each other in this manner is a huge drain on productivity.\r\n\r\n2) Work is not interesting and doesn't build your developer skill set\r\n\r\nThe data breach has created a very shortsighted culture. There is a cyber initiative that in theory would be important work to safeguard customer data, but as an initiative it's not very well managed. Don't get me wrong, securing platforms and customer data is and always should be the number one priority. But the kinds of things they have developers doing aren't making the platforms any more secure, and are largely dictated by non-technical types. There's teams of developers (a significant portion of devs) that are spending months doing nothing but continually upgrading versions of libraries of internal systems and filling out endless google sheets. \r\n\r\nThis work is the height of tedium and you can expect your developer skills to slowly degrade if you find yourselves in one of these nightmare positions. \r\n\r\n3) Lots of late night releases\r\n\r\nMore so than other places that I've worked, you likely expect to be up on late night releases 2 to 3 nights per week. This is a drain on your work life balance and one of parts of the job that are actually not conducive to work life balance, otherwise the work load is pretty fair.\r\n\r\n4) High turnover (and loads of technical debt)\r\n\r\nThis may vary with team, but almost every platform I've encountered is understaffed and filled with technical debt. It's a vicious cycle where developers are leaving because the platforms are unmaintainable, which leads to new developers going through the same burnout and leaving. You can't under-staff a platform and continually put off refactoring and listening to developers without paying a price.\r\n\r\n5) The hiring process leaves a lot to be desired. \r\n\r\nApplicants for software developer positions are given questions out of a pool that interviewers are mandated to pick form and are frankly... awful. They're solving a small coding challenge that has no resemblance to the kind of work that we do on a day to day basis. It's no surprise that with this hiring process we get a fair amount of developers that can't contribute to the team in any meaningful way and are rarely fired, but merely moved from team to team forever.\r\n\r\n6) Company politics are rampant\r\n\r\nI've personally seen managers straight up lie to another to get ahead. On one occasion one manager said he would give a developer to the other if they could transition a platform, and then went back on his word and pretended he never said this. I was shocked. Some of these managers directors are so without moral compass and scheming they make Machiavelli's characters look like Fred Rogers."}, {"review_title": "Top Company in Richmond area", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "9 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Senior Project Manager in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Capital One is one of the top companies to work for in my area.

This ties in with the previous point, in that you never really know how well you are doing until year end.\r\n\r\n- Prepare for a lot of \"80/20\" corner cutting. Timelines are very aggressive (one could say unrealistic), and management does not like delays. Therefore, shoddy analysis has to be done, and covered up with pretty Powerpoints. Discrepancies are not looked into closely unless they don't \"fit the story\". \r\n\r\n- Expect people to be selfish. Because this is a \"results focused\" company, anything that does not contribute directly to your results will be ignored. That means that there is no incentive for others to help you unless it benefits them or they have a kind heart (and thankfully, there were a lot of kind hearted people). Collaboration is rare unless it is mandated from above.\r\n\r\n- There is no training if you are not straight out of college. \"Professional\" hires are given a 3 day orientation, then thrown right in. You will definitely notice this, as you realize that hires straight out of college seem to know how to talk the talk, and have better connections.\r\n\r\n- You don't get to choose the team you are hired to, you are assigned randomly to teams that need people."}, {"review_title": "worst experience ever in my career", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good salary, good 401K, in general good benefits", "cons": "When a harassment and discrimination case is reported, HR protects their management and the bank's reputation/image, not who is experiencing harassment, who is part of minorities."}, {"review_title": "Great work life balance", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Data Analysis Manager in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work life balance\r\nGreat place to work in the banking sector\r\nMore of a fintech company", "cons": "Location limited on east coast"}, {"review_title": "Bank that has moved towards being a software company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Senior Associate Software Engineer in McLean, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Capital One uses a lot of leading technologies for their tech stacks", "cons": "There are still many teams working with legacy applications that may be onboarded to AWS but are a pain to deal with"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Financial Analyst in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance very important and pay is great", "cons": "You generally have to live in one of their people centers (DC, NYC, etc..)"}, {"review_title": "Good company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Cyber Risk Manager in McLean, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "culture and job security.
