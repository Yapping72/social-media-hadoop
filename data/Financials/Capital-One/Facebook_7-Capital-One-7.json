Salary is comfortable for the area I was in. The offices are new and nice. People are generally friendly.", "cons": "The biggest problem I have with Capital One as an employer is their pipe-dream vision of a digital transformation that often leads to massive employee layoffs. The most important fact you need to know is that the company's growth story is mostly dead; if you expect to catch a rising tide that will lift your career, I would look elsewhere. Historically speaking, Capital One is successful in only two areas of consumer finance - credit cards and auto lending, but there are very few growth opportunities remaining in these areas. The upmarket card business is overheated and is in an unsustainable rewards arms race that will likely blow up in the next recession (potentially forcing thousands of layoffs or possibly bankrupting the company).  Card Partnerships is a break-even venture at best that has seen massive layoffs over the past few years. While Capital One is successful in auto lending, there are virtually no growth opportunities available except perhaps in refinance, but that will likely start a price war with companies with cheaper costs of funds if it continues to expand, which could kill the auto finance business in short order. Capital One completely failed (to the tune of thousands of layoffs) in the mortgage and home equity businesses as well as in the brokerage business. The commercial business is marginally successful at best, and there are no realistic plans to expand internationally beyond their minuscule footprint in the U.K. It seems like the main strategy of upper management is to hope that their \"digital\" transformation will miraculously change these hard realities, and it's simply not true.\r\n\r\nI don't mean to be bitter, and there was a time when I believed the half-baked ideas of upper management that they could benefit their customers while still maintaining a sustainable business that didn't consistently hurt employees that made that success possible. I changed my opinion when I saw thousands of people lose their jobs over and over again because of the culture of irresponsible and reckless expansions, which is symptomatic of a toxic corporate culture fueled by an arrogant and dangerous hope that Capital One's \"best\" people or digital innovation will exempt them from the harsh realities of running a profitable business. Moreover, virtually all of the executive hires (VP+) are ex-management consultants who often pitched these dangerous ideas at their old firms and paid no personal cost for the often disastrous results. Note that a lot of the people who hold high positions with just a bachelor's degree joined when the company was significantly smaller; almost everyone who does that now and doesn't relentlessly play politics (instead of focus on their skills and contributions to the company) gets stuck.

Never trust what your manager says at face value. Always send meeting notes after each meeting as they insist on having conference calls vs written documentation to play the 'he said, she said' game. \r\nWhen there is a clear lie, they claim to have a 'miscommunication' and the employee might have 'misunderstood what his/her supervisor said'\r\n\r\n2.  Performance management - rating your employees against each other is creating a civil war to survive. \r\n\r\n3. Personality, gender, race and position matters - if you are an introvert, female, not white and a position and/or team that are deemed as \"non-essential\", you will be first in the list to be discarded when there is a re-org.\r\n\r\n4. It is basically a big high school run by \"popular\" people, Capital One is *huge* on politics. If you do not play that game, you are toast.\r\n\r\n5. Your future and advancement in this company depends on your supervisor. If you are not his/her favorite, watch out.\r\n\r\n6. More on performance review - there are no clear standards on what is expected of you in your role. It depends on which LOB you are in,  the team you are part of and unknown expectations of the current VP of your department. \r\n\r\n7. Perceptions are everything, actual results mean nothing. Your performance is measured based on reviews by your team members and colleagues. If somebody does not like you because they just don't or because you are doing your job and they do not like being called out, it is a red X in your credibility. Recovering from that is pretty much impossible.\r\n\r\n8. Directors are too involved in the individual team dynamics. They use their authority to override roles, responsibilities and impose their wishes. You do what they ask for blindly or you will be in trouble, despite forcing you to go against the responsibilities of your role.\r\n\r\n9. Lack of accountability in management for their decisions. If something goes wrong, they will blame someone else for the lack of results in order to avoid the blame and consequences.\r\n\r\n10. Recognition for a job well done depends on what kind of project you are allocated to. \r\nIf it is a \"we need to work on it to survive in the industry\", forget about it. You will be taken for granted.\r\nIf it is \"we are working on it to differentiate ourselves and break new grounds in the industry\", you will be the star, no matter how well or bad the project is moving along.\r\n\r\n11. 2-4 reorgs a year are clearly not needed as they create chaos. It takes months to recover from a reorg and then a new reorg is announced.\r\n\r\n12. Employees can be treated like thieves when they are let go. There is no need to have a security guard shadow a good standing respectful employee when he/she is let go - while the employee cleans his/her desk, returns the laptop and badge and is walked out the door- No, it did not happen to me, I know what you are thinking ;) \r\nTreat people with respect."}], [{"review_title": "Brilliant co-workers; unstable org chart", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "21 Jan 2019", "job_title": "IT Manager in Baton Rouge, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I worked with some of the smartest people I've ever been around.

They are all true with the exception of the allegations of racism.   I have never personally witnessed overt racism and/or biased hiring and promotions based on race.  It's a pretty diverse crowd that works there, although I cannot say with absolute certainty that racism never happened.  I have heard employees say that people who take time off for maternity leave don't get promoted though.\r\n\r\nWhat I can say is that the cross cal essentially guarantees people to lie, cheat, and back-stab.  It is a very toxic environment.  There is little incentive to cooperate on projects bc everyone is trying to avoid the category 4 (incomplete) rating at the end of the year.  I have literally had people not answer my questions and say \"I know how to solve this but I'm not going to tell you bc we are competing against each other.\"\r\n\r\nThe work that I did was presented to top management but they did not acknowledge my contributions.  My boss instead took credit for my work and I was given a bad review at the end of the year bc other associates \"performed better\".  So visibility matters more than the actual work that was done.  \r\n\r\nThis also results in a structure where there a small group of yes-men (and women) at the top with huge egos go on power trips and a very high turnover rate amongst the vast majority of their subordinates.  Bc the interview process is quite intense, talented analysts generally leave after a year or 2 for better jobs.\r\n\r\nSimilar to some of the other comments here, when I confronted my boss he said there were \"leadership and communication\" issues.

You are sold on the idea that Capital One wishes to hire people to take care of their customers, and the customer is king/queen and all that matters is your amazing skills with the customer.  In fact it is an \"inbound call center\"  looking for butts in chairs.  Once you are past the sales pitch  of HR  you realize you didn't read the fine print someplace along the way.  In your role as work at home customer service front line agent, be prepared to play C.Y.A. to the extreme.   You will be blamed for any problem that exists within the company.  From technical issues to legitimate customer complaints you attempt to escalate for resolution, it's all entirely YOUR fault.  No one else is doing anything wrong at this company EXCEPT the front line employee. You can be fired in a heartbeat for anything at all.  I quit in disgust, but after talking to persons who were fired, there is never any hard fact to back up what managers say.   They can apparently say anything at all and HR just goes along and signs off. \r\n\r\n If you look back at reviews you will see a very negative one from 2010.  I feel the same way today and it is 2015.  You will also see an \"answer\" from management stating \"we have an open door policy reach out to us\"  That was around 2 years ago.  I have no idea who is above my up-line manager, the name of my site HR representatives, nor even who manages this site.     The only person i can reach out to is my manager who is going to write me up any chance they get, and never educates me as to what I can do to improve my performance.   In fact my manager does not follow company procedures when it comes to customers. It is clearly stated that it is part of our job to call customers back at time of their choosing if we cannot resolve their issue within the call.  A representative is supposed to be given time to make these calls.  However you are not.  You must make these call backs when you have \"slow time\".  It is currently back to back calls without even a second of breathing room in between.  Well if you don't make your outbound calls then you are going to get  people on your back for that.  This is just one example of how entirely impossible this company is.   If you are a person who can figure out how to cheat the system and likes sucking up to your boss and is totally self absorbed and likes to lie to customers then this job is right up your alley.   If you are used to facing problems straight on, coming up with solutions to them, and having this heard and implemented, then not the company for you.  If you are used to teamwork and consulting your manager and other departments in the interest of putting your heads together to work out issues for the customer, this is not the place for you.   If you believe that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect from the janitor on up to the top, this is not the place for you.  You will see plenty of good reviews for this company.  Most likely they were sent an e-mail, and given time off the phone and told to complete a \"survey\" all within the watchful eye of a manager.  Because I don't know a person I have talked to that feels in any way this company is  doing what is right."}, {"review_title": "Okay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Irving, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits were very very good, training was very good, they tried to make a call center atmosphere fun as possible.", "cons": "Low pay, managers were often biased, too much drama on the floor and not a lot of consistency with policies."}], [{"review_title": "Okay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Irving, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits were very very good, training was very good, they tried to make a call center atmosphere fun as possible.", "cons": "Low pay, managers were often biased, too much drama on the floor and not a lot of consistency with policies."}, {"review_title": "I wish I could stay", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Capital One is open and honest with their interactions with their employees.

It's political and full of cliques and if you're not willing to play the games, you are tortured until it is not worth staying anymore. I was with ING Direct for many years and would never have left if it wasn't for the change in culture and the desire of my manager to get ahead at the cost of her team.  Where I used to be proud to tell people where I worked, I became ashamed and would NEVER suggest that anyone leave a good company to come and work at Capital One 360.  Its a shame, but they are very quickly losing good people.  Now other companies are benefiting from their mistakes!  Do NOT do business with this company or go to work there. I assure you, you will not be happy.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- benefit costs are very high\r\n- cut-throat environment\r\n- CYA culture\r\n- very, very political with a lot of red tape\r\n- very meeting focused (meetings for the sake of meeting)\r\n- if you are not a drinker, this is not the company for you; drinking is encouraged at MOST events"}, {"review_title": "Teller", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Bank Teller in Bay Shore, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fantastic company to work for, benefits are great only bank in my area that matches up to 7% 401k. if you work hard you get promoted from with in right away, i started as a part time teller and with in 2 months got promoted to full time, 6 months later and im currently up for another promotion to be a banker.", "cons": "everything so far is fantastic"}, {"review_title": "Management for the N.E.
