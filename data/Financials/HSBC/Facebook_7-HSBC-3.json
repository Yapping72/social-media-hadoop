Hence, it leads to poor work life balance of the team members.\n\n2) Pay not upto expectations- As per my tenure there hikes are pretty low (around 3-4% pa)\n\n3) Biased Management- I was hired as graduate and they hired for two types of profiles (Strikers - 7 LPA and Acers - 16 LPA). The distinction they made in these two profiles was Strikers were meant to give basic support in projects while Acers were meant to give basic support and play lead roles in projects. But in practice, the type of work Strikers and Acers did was pretty much the same (Really no difference in these two profiles apart from pay). Also, in the next appraisal cycle, Acers got pretty good hike (around 20-30%) while Strikers good pretty low (around 2-3%) creating further gap in their pays. Hence, the management is biased and I didn't really understand their basis of this discrimination.\n\n4) Not much to learn in a long run career perspective- The department where I worked used pretty obsolete technologies like AS/400, Mainframes which are still used in \nmany banks due to security and other reasons but as an individual you won't get much to learn and grow as compared to the fast growing technologies in software industry. Also, as per my experience, the bank is not much ready to evolve to better technologies so easily. (I don't know why??) But, as an individual you won't evolve here.\n\n5) Bad Work Environment in terms of people (This is just based on my experience) - The team where I worked was not that efficient in having healthy discussions internally or contribute to solve problems (It was mostly copy and paste others work.. ). Also, there was too much individualism (depending on one individual) instead of collective collaboration (team owning the task) for any task. There was no cross collaboration across teams (I don't know maybe because of too much complicated rules/processes to communicate across teams). Lastly, bad office politics like blaming each other, not having healthy discussions, misuse of power among the hierarchy and senior management not helpful to resolve concerns of employees."}, {"review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 May 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in New Delhi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Company to work with.", "cons": "None.
