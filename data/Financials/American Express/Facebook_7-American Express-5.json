If you don't have a finance background or an aptitude for numbers you can certainly get by, but if you can combine quant savvy with creative thinking and influencing skills you will do very well.\r\nManagement is generally very open to work-life balance needs, and takes employee development and satisfaction extremely seriously.

If you are a part of the clique with certain senior leaders, then your chances are better than those who are not. Moving up from a starting level analyst level to senior manager might be pretty easy as it can happen as quickly as in 5 years. Moving up beyond that level is a little difficult as the opportunities slow down. If you are an external hire who joined directly as a manager / senior manager, you will have a tough time moving up to the director level since the current management gives preference to those who have been in the company in a variety of roles even though they may have less experience then you do. In a way, the company kind of ignores anything you did prior to joining Amex.  In some departments, Canadian employees don't get promoted even if they are very qualified. They end up promoting someone in the US HQ and bringing them to Canada. This really affects the morale of the team. In recent years, there has been a lot of employee attrition as many employees got better opportunities with competitors like Scotia. At the VP level it seems everything is fine as they keep getting broader roles and promotions. Its a case of rich getting richer.

They HATE the CFPB, they are doing anything they can to and then hide from CFPB... ironically more than 150 disabled employees have left (come to your own conclusion with that)  Many employees have tried to sue for the company for harassment due to disability - but squashed due to EMPLOYEE FORCED ARBITRATION.   If you go to HR to file a complaint in Florida - expect to be Fired.  Amex has been fined under $1Billion from CFPB for banking violations: discrimination, deceptive advertising, illegal card practices, charged unlawful fees, failed to report consumer disputes, billing customers for services they did not receive. AMEX takes away their employee\u2019s and merchants CIVIL RIGHTS through FORCED ARBITRATION. Currently a lawsuit, they are not paying employees for their overtime \u2013 AMEX would rather pay for a lawsuit and for lawyers than pay their employees overtime pay. Just laid off 4,000 employees. Several lawsuits in the past few years for FMLA discrimination but were all dropped after AMEX showed proof of arbitration. How do you have so many lawsuits against the disabled? No wonder Costco dropped AMEX in Canada and possibly US as well."}, {"review_title": "Smart people, highly flexible work scheduling, interesting and challenging work, great brand", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "21 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Director, Product Management in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amex people tend to be highly collaborative, intelligent and motivated.
