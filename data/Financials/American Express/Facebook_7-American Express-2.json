This is something that could have been done by a group of high school kids in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nTrying to bring in external tools to make our jobs more efficient is nearly impossible. The red tape is so thick, it would be faster to build your own operating system than try to buy useful software.\r\n\r\nThe group I work for seems to want to find problems for their solutions instead of solving actual business problems. I heard a funny term, \"resume driven development\".\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in other reviews, AMEX is not a place to grow your skills, but a place to get complacent and cash checks. If you're eager to learn, grow, and do amazing things, keep looking. This is not the place for growth.
