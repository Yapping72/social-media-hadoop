It has become a horrible place to work.  Everyone is miserable at this company.  They treat their employees like numbers.  I was even told once when we were sent \u201chelp\u201d that couldn\u2019t actually do anything to help us that \u201cit\u2019s a body\u201d.  That\u2019s what we are to them- bodies.  Numbers.  They act like they care about their employees, but it\u2019s all an act.\n\nDuring the COVID pandemic, they implemented many things for the \u201csafety\u201d of their employees; but, that was all on paper.  In reality, things were much different.  They tell you to call in if you\u2019ve been exposed to COVID or have symptoms like COVID, but they don\u2019t pay you; they make you use all your sick time and vacation time, and if you don\u2019t have enough then you don\u2019t get paid.  And if you do what you\u2019re supposed to do, stay home and call life services, then you get in trouble with your manager/market leader.  One such market leader even recently told her managers to document every call in so they can write them up eventually if they want to get rid of them.  They make you stay home but negatively affect your future with the company.  Also, they did things like saying don\u2019t have meetings on paper, but making people having meetings in real life.\n\nAnother thing they did during COVID was they paid us a \u201cbonus\u201d for people working in the financial centers.  They talked it up in the media and our CEO even received and award for his handling of the pandemic.  They day after receiving the award, the company shut down the bonus.  The associates were only given a couple weeks notice of this, and the \u201cnotice\u201d was put in the middle of an email that looked exactly like emails sent many times before talking up everything the company was \u201cdoing\u201d for their employees.  There was no other mention of it.  The managers weren\u2019t even made aware of it to prepare their employees.  Those who chose to read the whole letter, even though it was almost an exact replica of letters that came before, were given a short notice.  Those who skipped over it weren\u2019t even aware of the change.  Either way, this negatively impacted employees who were expecting that extra payment.  It\u2019s hard to budget when the amount that you receive is less than the amount that you expected.\n\nOutside of COVID, things still don\u2019t look good.  Bank of America uses the same practices that another bank got scolded for a few years back.  Bank of America didn\u2019t change these practices, they just changed the name to make it sound less demanding (though the demands remain the same).  Even now, on paper they try to word it like they\u2019re not pushing sales, when in fact they truly are.  You WILL get written up if you don\u2019t make your sales goals.  And if your center is short handed, which many centers currently are, then the sales goals for the center do not change.  If you\u2019re supposed to have 3 sellers and you only have 1, then that one seller has to make the goal of ALL 3 sellers, even though there is logically not enough time to so that person doesn\u2019t make their goal.\n\nThere are SO MANY phone calls.  Multiple calls you\u2019re required to be on per week that are about the exact same thing.\n\nThey make you take your picture daily wearing the color of the day and then post it online without you permission.\n\nThere\u2019s a ridiculous amount of nonsense emails making it easy to miss important ones.\n\nThey micromanage EVERYTHING.  Literally everything.  And they do it by spying on you through security cameras.  The cameras that were put in place in case someone robbed the bank or there\u2019s another security incident are being used to check if someone uses their cellphone or takes a drink of water.  Or if you  walk two feet from your station to grab something, and are still right next to your station and can see it and customers can\u2019t see your screen because you\u2019re in an inaccessible area, and you don\u2019t lock your screen- written up.  Then they circulate the camera footage to humiliate you and teach everyone a lesson.\n\n Now their latest thing is they\u2019re making people travel to other centers, even if when they replied they said \u201cno\u201d to willing to relocate.  And they\u2019re making people go to centers they\u2019re not comfortable going.  And they\u2019re making people work on Saturday, and extending Saturday to a full day, because they don\u2019t care about their employees or work/life balance.\n\nBank of America expect you to live and breathe for them.  They\u2019re slowly killing me.  They do not try to find out why their people are unhappy, they just try to force them to stay like giving them \u201cstock\u201d or that they don\u2019t actually have until working another 4 years. So many people have left the company because it\u2019s become unbearable and I intend to as well. \n\nDo yourself a favor and find somewhere else.  It\u2019s not worth the deterioration of your mental health."}, {"review_title": "Good Benefits, Mediocre Salary", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "benefits were good: health insurance, 401K matching, paternity leave up to 16 weeks.", "cons": "Salary wise, they need to step up. bonus structure is a toss of a coin, hard to achieve every single time, even putting hard work. extremely hard to schedule vacation time. you have to submit your vacation on JANUARY, and it cannot be on holidays or conflict with someone else's vacation time. zero flexibility"}], [{"review_title": "Stable Job with Lots of Bureaucracy", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "1 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Strategy Leader in Charlotte, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stable and open to hear feedback from org.", "cons": "Time at the company is what matters for your. next role."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "11 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Program Manager in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunities for advancement and great benefits.", "cons": "There are not any significant cons"}, {"review_title": "Baf", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Financial Solutions Advisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay was pretty decent", "cons": "The entire job is evil and bad"}, {"review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Vise President", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good teams, friendly environment, decent pay", "cons": "No hikes, no good bonus and old systems."}, {"review_title": "review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Relationship Banker", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "coworkers are a pleasure to work with", "cons": "salary is not as high"}, {"review_title": "Good company to join", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Software Test Automation Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very friendly environment and work life balance and flexible working works.No pressure from superiors.Good job security", "cons": "There is no cons to point out"}, {"review_title": "Great work experience for growth but stagnant year over year compensation.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 May 2022", "job_title": "Auditor in Charlotte, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good networking opportunities in multiple divisions within the company.", "cons": "Pay structure is mid-tier to low in comparison to leading industry peers.

Everyone that works there has no sense of urgency, and relatively no experience. I came in thinking I was going to be a licensed banker but ended up a Banker/Teller which was an insult to me. I was the newest and youngest employee and had the most experience and drive by MARGINS. They are extremely understaffed, but covid is a big part of that. They give you a lot of PTO, but you can only use it in certain quarters which felt illegal to me for some reason. Sick time is frowned upon even though they give you a ton of it. The hours of Ops. are ridiculous for the customer and even more ridiculous for the employee, we were open 10-4 5 days a weeks which was always cringe to tell the customer because we all new that was ridiculous, but what was more ridiculous was still making your employees come in 2 hours before opening and just staring at a wall because there was nothing to do just so they fill out labor costs. The worst part is their technology, for a big bank they are light years behind, the tellers use three different systems and so do the bankers. I worked at Chase 6-7 years ago and there teller system was futuristic compared to BofAs 2022 teller system, It complicates the employees like I have never seen before they hate it and mentioned that everyday. On the Banker side the have slower systems and it's almost like they do that on purpose so you're forced to talk to the customer it's just a bad experience. The last, but worst part is the profiling they do, once you walk in they analyze you based of looks and it was awful, it made me feel sick to my stomach.

In addition, BofA seems to pinch pennies on business expenses (e.g. watches price tags very closely for business travel, vendor costs, \"extras\", such as employee blackberries, etc.). Also has a policy of maintaining/not altering employee salaries if you happen to move to a more expensive city. As such, be VERY sure about what city you choose to be placed in, as whatever salary you get there, that's what it will be. Meaning, if you get a role in Charlotte and later decide you want to transfer to New York City, Chicago, LA, etc. the Bank will NOT pay for a cost of living adjustment. You'll take your same Charlotte salary with you.\r\n-Very bureaucratic and tons of red tape. It can sometimes feel like you are actually working for the government vs. the private sector. This has its pluses in that you can have a good work/life balance without intense stress all the time because you can fly under the radar or at least not be scrutinized daily (at least outside investment and corporate banking, i.e. consumer and everywhere else), but it also means you have to be VERY proactive about building your career or you can fall through the cracks, be bored to death, and have your skills atrophy.

It is slowly starting to transform from their more internal framework to more \u201cplain old\u201d Vue than the internal framework, which is good thing to IMO since Vue offers a far superior developer experience.\r\n5. Programmers start to get yearly bonuses in 2022 along with restricted stock units as well or so I\u2019ve been told.\r\n\r\nTo be frank, of my job didn\u2019t pay what it pays and didn\u2019t make use of a modern UI framework like React or Vue then I would not be working here.

IMO, It\u2019s not very intuitive, is very clunky and slow, and thus difficult to develop on. Anti patterns are found everywhere and it all stems from their internal framework. More than that, it\u2019s not really like anything else that is that a modern UI developer would already be familiar with, so those skills won\u2019t be transferable to other jobs. Therefore, your skills will not translate to BofA\u2019s internal stack either.

If you are in the states then you can still get access but if you are not then you absolutely not get access to SO whatsoever on the banks proxy server which is very stupid IMO. I wish they\u2019d get called out publicly over this and change this god awful rule.\r\n\r\n4. Documentation of internal tooling is very scarce. Even the docs to get your environment setup was \u201chalf-assed\u201d. Probably by some employees who got tired of helping everyone but didn\u2019t have time to make proper documentation. In other areas in the back, it only gets worse\u2026 much, much worse. This needs a drastic overhaul because it\u2019s a freakishly easy fix.\r\n\r\n5. For the reasons above, I definitely get the feeling that the software engineers are still second class citizens at the bank despite the fact that more and more people now days set up bank accounts entirely online. The feeling I get is that they aren\u2019t interested in making top quality products, but that they are more like \u201chey let\u2019s get us some of those software people to make some stuff we need to stay competitive in the digital age\u201d, only they do slightly more than the bare minimum. That said, it\u2019s still definitely better than most other SWE jobs simply because of the massive resources that they have. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about this for more than 10 years or so because Ally Financial is completely online and is now BofAs main competitor in Charlotte, and they actually do treat their software engineers like first class citizens despite the fact they have far less resources than BofA at this time. Like I said, that will even out in the near future though. Especially if BofA doesn\u2019t get on the ball and start making everything with updated UI technology.\r\n\r\n6. The developer onboarding experience is terrible. Please fix it. You should have new hires monitored very closely for the first three months regardless of their skill level with coding. There needs to be some sort of mentoring program started too!!"}, {"review_title": "Great Colleagues, Not So Great Job", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "29 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Client Service Representative in Utica, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Co-workers and managerial staff are all friendly and knowledgeable.", "cons": "You're tethered to a headset at your desk for several hours on end with little to no relief.
