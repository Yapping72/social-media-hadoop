Opening an account usually required 2-4 weeks and management was not understanding and often reminded Advisers that they could be fired and replaced. Bank duties were also expected by Advisers, however they often conflicted with Merrill Lynch goals since most banking business was time consuming and was not a part of quarterly metrics used to review Advisers.

If the Adviser was great at Investments and earned a large quarterly bonus at the expense of Banking, then he/she was not lauded for their Investments accomplishments.

The time was mostly spent in front of a computer with training modules for 3 months.  The branch manager I was shadowing was supposed to be much more hands on with my training; however, the cut backs in staffing prevented this from happening.  This lead to many questions and trial by error once in the actual position itself.\r\n\r\nAt the market manager level, there were many false promises and lack of insight to issues at hand.  The overall message was to perform at a high level at all costs and concerns were ignored.  There was no guidance from my manager and morale overall was very low for the market.  Praise was rarely given, but criticism was delivered often.\r\n\r\nThrough the brilliance of cutting back on staffing, this caused many branches to run a skeleton crew.  If one person called of sick, it caused a major disruption in the performance of the center on that particular day and there was little to no hope of getting help anywhere else.  Cut backs on staffing also raised the risk of becoming less operationally sound and an increase probabliy of internal and external risk.  As staff members quit, in many cases, branches had to run with just 1 teller opreating both lobby and drive through.  These tellers had no time for breaks.  I am not sure why there were not more OSHA complaints filed.   All the while, there was the constant pressure of performing at a high level which demoralized staff.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend anyone to apply to Bank of America from the outside into any management position.  Tragically, it is a corporation in every sense of the word.  Market managers press very hard and take little into consideration the circumstances each branch faced.

Somehow, they have found a way to turn the Processors into Underwriters without the title or pay. The processors have too many responsibilities placed upon them, which makes it nearly impossible to be successful. I have lost count of the amount of people taking \"stress leave\". I have also never seen so many people being written up for ridiculous things that they have little control over. \r\n\r\nLeaders (over the team leads) seem very out of touch with what the processors have to deal with on a daily basis as they sit in their offices all day. They ask for feedback and when feedback is given, they get defensive and dismiss any concerns. \r\n\r\nThere are also many huddles, meetings, trainings, and other miscellaneous things that interrupt the day and make it impossible to get all work done. Then you get management wondering why you didn't finish your work for the day. They also wonder why no one wants to participate in the occasional \"fun\" activities they have scheduled. It's because processors are overworked and too stressed to participate!\r\n\r\nA processor will be expected to collect/review an almost constant stream incoming documents, review up to 4-5 new applications a day, keep the client \"informed\", answer incoming calls, deal with escalations, resolve title issues, and \u201cdecision\u201d at last 2 applications a day (amongst many other things). They are also expected to complete income reviews, even though the underwriter will basically disregard it and re-write it themselves. \r\n\r\nThe processors don\u2019t mind working hard, but the size of the \"pipeline\" (number of applications assigned to processors at one time) is too high which makes it nearly impossible to complete the work that is expected. You are often left feeling very defeated at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nAlso, forget about vacation or calling in sick without having to worry about if your workload will be taken care of. There is not enough coverage to properly handle the out of offices, so you will spend the next week trying to catch up. Coming back from vacation is also stressful, as your pipeline gets depleted while you are out; which means you are going to be pushed more new applications than you can handle in one day. \r\n\r\nIncentives (bonuses) are not great and are structured in a way that is too complicated to understand. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend this position to anyone.

Reasoning is that if you developed a better way to do something you will take work away from those that spend lots of time doing  a task a mundane, slow, and banal way.  Stagnation in your role, with no way to move up, is essentially the life in BofA.  Ambition is punished.  \r\n\r\nMany people were laid off recently May and June 2017.  The year began with substantial gains and the CEO stated that the firm is growing with no risk of lay offs on the horizon. SVP stated the same, especially to production IT environments.  This is smoke in your face since over 900 production IT employees were laid off a few months later.  My position, as well as two others on my team, was laid off due to a reason of 'staffing reduction'.  Not even two weeks later and personnel from another declining team were shifted into these roles, filling the same exact positions and responsibilities.  The new personnel have zero experience in the position, need to be severely trained and supervised, and are actually paid more than the prior team members.  Does that sound fair or even smart to you?\r\n\r\nDue to HR incompetence, IT positions that were initially hired in a non-IT campus, such as Chandler, AZ, leave a person with zero ability at chances of being re-hired if they're laid off.  HR managers do not and will not contact a manager that has an available IT position at several national sites to determine if Chandler is an option.  HR looks at the spec sheet, Chandler is not listed there, and the answer is \"no, it's not available in Chandler or Phoenix.\"  We all know that a telecommute position, or a national position, can be done in Chandler or Phoenix - why screw over former workers by allowing your HR people to be so lazy and not in any way assist former employees?  BofA states caring, culture, compassion, and understanding, but it is all B.S., especially when you're laid off and HR won't even check to see if a position can be done at another corporate site.\r\n\r\nLastly, consider 1% raises to be the norm if you're in the upper specrum of pay for your position.  Even if you work more, have more responsibility, the lower staff in your team will receive 3%, 5%, or higher per year while a person with much more experience and responsibility is shunned."}, {"review_title": "Relationship Banker", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay \r\nClient interaction \r\nCross trained for teller line", "cons": "Company do not value employees your just a number.

Depending on what department you work in the office space can be pretty and can make you feel good about being there. The money was great and each year the company met its goal, employees got a bonus sometimes in time for Christmas. If you're single and you want to travel, this is definitely the company for you- you'll go to really nice towns...lots considered tourist spots.

I found it difficult to look at people struggling to stay afloat knowing how much money the company wastes; i.e. staying at the best hotels in great cities, they'd even pay for extra night or two if it was your first time to that particular city (of course that depended a lot on who approved your travel).  One of the thing that I didn't like was the backstabbing- I walked out with an entire cutlery set in back when all was said and done.  A lot of the backstabbing wasn't even to get an immediate reward- it was just learned behavior with the thought that stepping on your back might help them later or might make them look better to a bigger boss...and I really emphasize might.  People were taking credit for other's work whenever they could get away with it.  That seems petty looking back on it but in the moment it can be unnerving. My workload was way too much for one person and if you ask for help- well, just don't ask.  All the good things you learned about being a good, respectful and courteous employee...throw them out of the window. People are only respectful and courteous if they need you or if they're going to look bad in front of their and your peers, otherwise, it is completely ingenuine.  The proof will be when they act like they don't know when they move to another team and they will because that's what they do...people are always, always moving from team to team.  Work is often duplicated, sometimes triplicated because the one employee that knows where something is is not around.  There's a lot of that- one person hogging the knowledge for job security then pushing the blame off on you because you're not learning quick enough.  Well, I think that is a fairly good primer.

VVOEs only good for 7 days really???!!!  Is that some kind of a joke??? You usualy have to revarify employment at least 3 times before you go to docs and mind you that the VOE is the last thing you do before sending a file to final underwrting, that tells you how awful long it takes to get something though to approval. After that mess your manager then has to quality review your file. Of course this is after you have had to fill out about 4 checklist on your file and rebalance it about two or three times so that you come out with the correct cash out for a client. All this red tape and BS and they give you quotas each month and push you to fund fund fund, what a joke. Worst part is we use Countrywide softwear and do everything the Countrywide way.  Who bought who?? Thats what most people there say. You gotta wonder if the Countrywide way was so great, why did they go under, whatever. Its total blind leading the blind, everyone is stressed out, everyone dreads coming to work, and forget the pay. Ive been in the business for over 10 years and Ive gotten paid for doing a lot less then I do here.

Some clients I havent even had time to call out an approval to and Ive had their file for over a month, even worse.

As for employment in a call center at B of A, it is not all that great.  When hired I was told holidays were alternated between sites- haven't had a holiday off yet, unless it was a scheduled day off.  Sure, they pay you for the day, whether or not you worked but it would be really nice to spend a holiday with my family.  Upon hire they give you 3 weeks vacation- trying to take the time is a real chore.  Then they have this thing called occurances that is associated with your sick time- so whether you take one day or 4 consecutive days off sick it is counted a one occurance.  That means if you call off sick on Monday go to work on Tueday then call off sick on Wednesday- that counts as two occurances.  After so many, they will fire you...strange set up.  During your scheduled work hours- you are timed everytime you log off to go the bathroom- if you are gone too long, you will be told to take if off your next break~ I understand this is against labor laws.  Be prepared to be tied to your desk and monitored on everything you do from the time you step foot in the door..It is true that nobody in this company is on the same page; you can ask four different managers the same question and you will get four different answers. I find the majority of management is not what you would expect- the women are the worst.  My advice is if you decide to take a position at B of A- stay out of the Customer Serivce and Sales department- what is expected of an employee in this department in truly unreasonable.  Do not buy into the 'incentive' ploy- very few get incentive, practices and procedures are at times, unethical.  Yes, there is room for advancement, however you need to be with the company for at least 1 year before you can apply for another position within the company- note: you have to apply- you will not be promoted.

I'm writing this review because I wasn't able to find one when I joined.\r\n\r\nSome pros:\r\n1.) If you're interested in finance, it's not a bad place to be. BofA is a recognizable name and the program is supposedly well regarded.\r\n\r\n2.) Most of the people I worked with were friendly and enjoyable to be around. \r\n\r\n3.) The hours are reasonable - everyone I worked with left work by 6 pm everyday. If you aren't based in NYC, it's probably earlier than that.\r\n\r\n4.) 15 days of vacation is pretty good for finance, especially when you've just graduated from college.", "cons": "Oh, the cons. There are many.\r\n\r\n1.) They continue to pay the class of TAPs the following year more money without offering the same realignment to the current class. For instance, the 2014 and 2015 TAPs in NYC were paid 71k. In 2016, they were paid 85k. I left before hearing about the 2017s, but because BofA is trying to be competitive with Goldman and JP, it's likely more.\r\n\r\n2.) When you're promoted to AVP in two years, you (probably) won't get a significant raise.  You will only get a raise if you have another offer from another company.\r\n\r\n3.) They try to claim that they \"teach\" you finance, but the reality is that most trading desks are more complex beyond what they teach you in training. It will take 6 months to a year to feel like you're actually doing any work. \r\n\r\n4.) You have absolutely no say as to what team you will end up on. If you end up on a Front Office facing team that uses Quartz, great! You'll get more visibility and probably more money if you stay there for years, and valuable experience since Python and Quartz are in-demand skills. But, if you end up on a Back Office team or doing ASD (support) work, you won't get much exposure or transferable skills and will be stuck at BofA forever. Trust me, the recruiting teams will try to convince you otherwise, but the reality is that a significant number of TAPs end up in a back office role on a team that has nothing to do with trading.\r\n\r\n5.) If you're female or white or both, you will be in the very, very vast minority unless they're now able to attract a higher caliber of candidate with the increased salary. Most people in the program are Asian males. \r\n\r\nReally glad I was able to get out of this place. The TAP program allowed me to get my foot in the door in NYC, but once I realized that I wouldn't advance at all, I got the skills I wanted and got out.

The goals are unattainable, and the minimum expectation when it comes to hitting sales goals is %100 or you don't get a quarterly bonus. This would be acceptable if the goals reflected the traffic that flows into your particular branch. However, the Relationship Managers who worked at the high traffic branch that I trained at had similar goals to what I have at a much slower branch.

On top of it all, Bank of America continues to eliminate branch personnel and slate their branches for less staffing, then brag about their \"earnings\" at the end of the year. It's obvious that the fewer people they employ the more money they will make, and the higher they set their goals the less they have to pay their sales employees in bonuses.

A lot of the managers in this part of the org are remote and that magnifies the challenges of communication and collaboration even further. What I would boil it down to is that the managers in this area of the bank have little care for the people who work here and they are far more concerned with managing up to climb the corporate ladder. Never a thank you for staying until 9 on a Friday to finish something, never a kind word for junior employees, just a miserable place to be 99% of the time.

There is definitely a lack of support for those directly working with the customer.  Little recognition for actually providing exceptional service.  It all becomes a game of making the numbers.

Although the Bank likes to view itself as a \"store of products\" and their bankers as \"sellers, \"   the bank dismisses in my opinion  a greater responsibility to provide an honest, upfront service for its customers.  The market management never gets involved in helping customers.  They come in the branch, cross their legs, and make their almighty genius observations.   There might be a line out the door and they do not do anything but sit and play around on their Blackberry.  What message does this send about the company's commitment to customer service?   It is no surprise they are repeat winners of the  2007 and 2008 \"Hall of Shame,\" for customer service ranked by MSN Money.  Despite the fact they are Bank, open the same hours  - day in and day out,  and the expected staffing levels are predictable, countless time is spent on a scheduling application trying to figure how to staff. The scheduling program reminds me of HAL in the film 2001.  Let's just say HAL malfunctions on a regular basis and in the end a 15 page schedule comes out where every 1/2 hour of every associate's day assigned a 3 letter code as to what they are supposed to be doing.  The Bank entrust HAL to staff everything correctly and gives no empowerment for a center to adjust staffing levels as  needed.  I have never seen any company struggle so hard as to get something as simple as staffing down. Is it any surprise that all this complication results in understaffing, missed opportunity,  and poor service.

Experience counts for nothing.  Very difficult to work in environment that is extreamly stressful due to poor leadership skills. No committment to employees to treat them fairly.   Even with good benefits the stress and mismanagement will make your job unbearable.  Company culture has gone down the drain since 2009. After acquiring very Merrill & Countrywide, the friendly \"let's help each other learn and grow to reach higher standards together\" bank culture has been replaced with a \"throw people under the bus\" and \"get ahead by any means, including making snap business decisions without considering consequences\" culture. The company doesn't care as much for it's associates as they used to. The atmosphere is highly political, much more so than it was in the past. - The company is VERY disorganized and lacks in an integrated communication strategy even within individual business units. The right hand never knows what the left hand is doing, even within peer teams. We spend a lot of time fixing problems that we create internally (many due to poor decisions, or lack of communication).\r\n- Company is too big, too complex, and extremely hard to navigate. There are many convoluted processes in place (like internal recruiting, compensation, & promotions) that the average associate does not understand. Like wise, the company is so big that it's very hard to know what's what organizationally & who's who, even within the smaller business units.\r\n- Company does not require formal training for managers. Likewise, most associates are only required to take annual compliance training, but no formal on the job training. This often leads to entire teams not knowing/understanding and underperforming in their function within the process. A lot of associates and managers are set up for failure if they are not savvy enough to just \"figure it out\".\r\n- Compensation/Promotions: The \"lucky\" associates that have the opportunity to work for great leaders may be fortunate enough to be paid in the appropriate range and recieve promotions based on capabilities and value add/leadership potential to the company. THIS VERY RARELY HAPPENS. More often then not, associates do not get timely promotions or raises. The associates who \"play the game\", but may do less or lower quality work will be be paid more than the guy who's really performing. Furthermore, all performance evaluations & rate increases, etc. are subjective based on the immediate manager. There is no consistency in how associates are rated, which leaves a lot of room for favoritism.\r\n- The company overall has certain values and advocates specific things like (inclusive meritocrazy, and flexible work schedules) but all that depends on the immediate manager. If an associates immediate manager does not advocate the companies values, than the associate is out of luck. Likewise, there is no associate support to protect from bad/poor management. If an associate is dealing with an unfair manager, he/she has no true recourse of action (other than to call the internal HR Advice & Counsel hotline, which means nothing because all they will do is document for a case against the associate if the problem continues to compound)."}, {"review_title": "Read between the lines", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jan 2013", "job_title": "Financial Advisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary, smart folks, paid to study for licensing", "cons": "Read between the lines.

When your on your lunch break, make sure you leave the building because they will call you if its busy to come back and let you finish your lunch later... seriously!

For example TCS, Infosys employees are considered better than BA Continuum employees and so stupid is the management that they describe BA Continuum as the non-subsidiary of Bank of America in all logos and ads.\r\n5. Any person working in Bank of America, US is big boss, but the same person working in BA Continuum, India automatically becomes an idiot with no respect compared to that in US. Applicable for all senior leaders who once worked in US and got transferred to India. Out of frustration they move back to US after some years. I have seen at least 2-3 senior leaders like this.\r\n6. BA Continuum India AVPs are no more  than tech leads of TCS or Infosys. Emails sent by AVPs or VPs of US reflect their attitude towards India AVPs. Any other companies in the globe has a different and respectful attitude towards their employees compared to their vendors. But here it is completely different. Now if same India AVP move to US, they command higher respect as already mentioned in Point No 4.\r\n7.

There are too many departments that have weak leadership mainly because they are worrying about saving their jobs vs. building career paths or demonstrating good work ethics for their people. It is getting worse each year that goes by. The pay and benefits are the only reason 95% of the people stay. Such a sad place. It is a shame more MBNA leaders didn't stay on board.

Unfortunately this is offset by some of the cons below.\r\n\r\n5) Decent benefits, although I can't compare with other companies. 100% match on 5% 401K match is generous.", "cons": "1) I have seen a lot of Nepotism. It's tough to get a promotion if you don't spend time with your boss over the weekends, parties, don't speak the same language, or share the same culture etc. (That's the case with my Boss, can't speak for other teams). People who do, have a leg up over you. This happens not just at lower levels, but at higher levels as well. ( I know of at least one case at the SVP level. One or two instances don't mean the practice is rampant, but cockroaches don't come in ones and twos.). If you join an established team, don't expect promotions based on merit. Promotions here are based on tenure. If you do join, learn as much as you can and move on to better opportunities within 2-3 years.\r\n\r\n2) Promotion process is very opaque. No feedback is given on why you were passed over for a promotion. Each manager above you will blame the manager above them. That seems to be the management practice: if you don't know the answer, or want to avoid uncomfortable conversations, blame your manager and say your hands are tied. All of this happens even after a very good performance review.\r\n\r\n3) Traffic jam on the corporate ladder. When someone above you leaves or retires, then the traffic moves up. If you are caught in the wrong lane, tough luck. The technology division with updated technology can run well with half the workforce. \r\n\r\n4) Your merit will go unrecognized. Yes, you will get reward points and pats-on-the-back. But that rarely translates to promotions, better assignments or more responsibility.\r\n\r\n5) The bank does nothing to identify it's next generation of technology leaders. On the operations side, each leader spent years in multiple lines of businesses before being considered for an executive level position. No such concept exists on the technology side. All technology divisions supporting the different lines of businesses are silos. The only way to work for a different organization would be to go through the limited number of opportunities on the career portal (not all positions are posted there), or to go through an EXTERNAL recruiter!!!!\r\n\r\n6) The Bank doesn't really invest in making sure their workforce has updated skills. Yes, they do have a internal learning portal, but a technology organization doesn't remain strong by people learning via youtube like videos and internal webex presentations. Management has a budget for end-of-year parties, travel expenses, multiple times a year, but almost nothing for internal training. A lot of my peers would love to skip the parties for decent training.\r\n\r\n7) Performance reviews are a joke. Most of the goals are not relevant to your job. Managers don't provide relevant and precise feedback on how to improve performance or how to get a promotion. I would rather get actionable constructive criticism everyday than a generic \"good job\" once a year. Managers don't know how to give such feedback, because they themselves never got such feedback.\r\n\r\n8) There is frequent performance evaluation at the bank, but it's only unidirectional. Associates are evaluated on their performance twice a year by their managers. Associates get to evaluate their managers through anonymous surveys only once in two years. Managers are then held accountable to their results by appropriate goals the following year. So management is hearing the same message over and over again, and makes changes by being reactive and slow. They are trying to put band-aid on a wound today that needed to be cauterized 3 years ago.\r\n\r\n9) There is a lot of inertia in the way the bank works and thinks. Multiple competing philosophies, of how technology needs to be delivered, exist and are not reconciled. The right hand does sometimes know what the left hand is doing, but the two hands are often speaking a different language."}, {"review_title": "Do not work here!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Financial Solutions Advisor in Tampa, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good health benefits.

It's so sad to say too because they recruited me on LinkedIn. I know realize if a company's recruiting you..it's because no one wants to work there. First of all, they set you up to fail. You're required to spend half your day trying to convince customers not to come into the branch and to use online, mobile, and ATM services instead. In the same regard you spend half your day calling/hounding customers over the phone begging them to come in for a sales appointment. It literally makes no sense. Also, the culture here is horrible. None of your coworkers like their job, are scared they're going to get fired, or just don't care at all. This leads to a lot of drama, nonsense, and poor team morale. You also have to use at least 3 applications/programs in order to do basic things on top of doing paperwork. Each customer interaction that could take 5 minutes takes 10 because of all the extra nonsense you have to do and all the changing through systems and filling out paperwork. Everything is outdated to say the least. You will also have your market sales manager and financial center manager down your neck 24/7. You have to send mid-day, end of day, sales reports to multiple people. I literally spend 15-20 minutes at the end of the day sending out sales reports. It's very repetitive and inefficient. If working for a company that doesn't care about you, makes your job incredibly difficult, doesn't care about the clients and just wants them to 'go away' then this is the bank for you! I don't think the bank as a whole is horrendous, but the retail banking side is a complete joke. Trust me when I say you don't want to find out for yourself.

You're manager seems like a jerk!\" (But used a different word) It was a humiliating experience. Even to ask off for a day was practically impossible. I asked off for a day to pick up my husbands Grandmother from the airport because she was going to fly into town to visit us. A month later when that day came, the manager who I had asked denied ever being asked and said I had to work because we didn't have enough staff. The reason we didn't have enough staff was because an employee would quite at least once a month if not more and if they hadn't quite already they were certainly talking about quitting at some point in the very near future to get themselves out of this horrible job. Very toxic work environment! Full of negativity energy and micromanagement. We were not allowed to have any personal conversations between each other out on the floor. Terrible company culture!!!!!! The pay was horrible! (16 an hr). Once I finally put in my two week notice, we were so understaffed that the Manager at the time would not allow me to take my separation review for the company. He said that I needed to stay on the teller line and he would take care of the review for me. Im guessing he didn't want corporate to receive his terrible review.

So much energy is spent trying to comply with over-demanding leadership that sadly the customers' satisfaction and other associates' growth is lost. Associates are not given the tools to succeed and are not even given the tools to uphold operational policies as there is often not enough staff to meet requirements.  Feedback is not received from the Market team who are completely out of touch with the reality of the daily life in the banking center.  Managers are not valued.  The school of thought among the Market team towards banking center managers and any other associate is \"Oh, well.

Management definitely takes advantage of staff and most banking centers are cutting down on tellers so we are severely understaffed. That said we have to work 9 hour shifts with no lunch. The manager doesn't care if we starve he just refuses to call in extra help to our center because he doesn't want to look like he can't control his branch. He will literally tell us \"today you guys aren't having lunch\", which is a legal violation on so many levels. Also I've come to realize that it doesn't matter what your work ethic is, if you want to move up within the company you have to have a certain relationship with higher superiors. I've seen so many qualified people lose out on positions just because the manager had a childish grudge against them, and that manager actually went out of his way to spread false rumors to the CMM and hiring managers just to make that candidate look bad. That manager instead would help employees who were his \"friends\" even though they had horrible sales numbers and help them get higher positions. Even though the manager I currently work with is horrible and tried to sabotage people's careers if they aren't on his good side, I have worked with other managers who have been amazing and truly care for their workers. Sadly, the number of bad managers overrides the number of good managers who actually try to nurture the growth of their employees. It's bad enough that Bank of America severely underpays its employees (we are one the lowest paid banks in the nation), but managers create an environment where work feels more like a prison. I also hate that as an organization, Bank of America is so disgustingly sales driven. They always say we need to look out for the customers best interest, and sell them a product. But if we know that the customer is going to suffer from extra debt and the product is going to obviously ruin their credit scores, managers don't care.

Mediocre people that over a few months or a few years years were connected with \"influential\" people through \"personal\" relationships or \"friends with benefits\" (please try to capture what I say) and managed to get to little higher positions than those of representatives. Anyways, their happiness does not last long because they are constantly transferred; used as objects or puppets.\r\n\r\n- These poor people that climbed those little positions, in their mediocre mind, they actually think they have come far and even act with an air of superiority, believing they are someone important. They seem to be proud to know codes, procedures and other things required in departments such as Fraud, Collections, Customer Service, etc. It is laughable and pathetic. There are people in positions of leaders who are alcoholics, who have behavioral problems, etc. It's all a circus!\r\n\r\n- The micro management is the agenda. Insecure people, whose academic background is little or have issues in their lives, make use of emotional abuse and micro management. They even force you to lie by telephone or via chat.\r\n\r\n- Those who work in chat are sometimes required to what they call \u201cdouble chat\u201d and are unfairly evaluated/reviewed for each chat, as if they had been assisted separately. The expectation is that, even if you\u2019re \u201cdouble chatting\u201d, you have to give 100% in every chat. Just Imagine dealing with chats with much detail each. Inhumanly you will  have to \u201cfocus on both\u201d at once. Sometimes they  will \u201cdouble chat\u201d back to back. Credit card customers: you will never know if you are being assisted exclusively or simply as part of a \u201cdouble chat\u201d.\r\n\r\n- Not to mention That the expected goals by people in collections are weirdly established. They shamelessly manipulate numbers. This will affect the unwary and benefit the protected by some mediocre manager.\r\n\r\nAs for rules and procedures that seek to manipulate and take unfair advantage of customers, that is another separate issue. And it is possible that other banks do the same. So I will not mention anything about that.

The few who remain are people who need money really bad or believe that there is no life and opportunities outside Bank of America.\r\n\r\nThe benefits offered are not bad, but they are not  better than other companies\u2019. So if you're looking for that, you better get it from a good company. Do not expose your health, only for average benefits.

Basically, if you look good and blame all the problems you cause on someone else, you will move up. Pay does not increase with responsibility. Performance appraisals only once a year and you will probably only get at most a 3% raise if you get one at all. Performance appraisals are mainly based on your dashboard numbers (the ratio of how many people you get to sit down with a banker versus the total amount of transactions you did, etc.), but your dashboard is also affected by your branch's numbers as a whole, so if your branch is doing poorly, that could result in you not getting a raise even if you personally are killing it. No commission for tellers. You are expected to badger the same people about the same products over and over again, even if they repeatedly refuse. You are expected to \"overcome objections\" (aka never take no for an answer). High stress level, especially on the 1st and 3rd of the month due to disability and social security coming through and customers wanting to withdraw all the funds.

This also contributes to the rigid structure offering little career growth. \r\n\r\nDemanding yet uninspiring leaders. \"My way or the high way\" approach from leaders. They also tend to not be transparent with their teams. Some are known to be rude yet no one (HR) does anything about it.

It's all about showing yourself in the best light and putting your name on things - and that is why there is  little collaboration/team effort.\r\n\r\nFace-to-face interaction not valued. For example, rather than having an IT person come to you in person to fix simple issues, they give you a roundabout method involving several people, live chat, and take multiple days, While remotely working is useful in some instances someone you just need a human to talk to - this probably contributes to the back office staff seeming vapid and lacking in personability.\r\n\r\nFinding information and the 'right person' for an enquiry is difficult - convoluted structures.  \r\n\r\nA lot of staff in my experience do not have a sense of ownership of their work. they are just executing because their boss 'said so'. this is a bad work ethic that common here.\r\n\r\nThis firm is not catching up with the times when it comes to modern workplaces and appealing to millennials - who are the majority of workers right now.
