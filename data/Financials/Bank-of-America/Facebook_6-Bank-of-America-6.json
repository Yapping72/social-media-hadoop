Call center environment was extremely micro managed and metrics were unrealistic. It requires you to be on one hundred all day long with a 30 minute lunch break. Working at that frantic level with back to calls is unsustainable mentally and takes a toll. I developed high blood pressure, I gained weight from stress eating , it exasperated my PTSD by constantly triggering adrenaline responses. As a result it was difficult to sleep and created a feeling of dread every morning before work and every Sunday thinking about the week ahead. I\u2019m a single mom so when I got home I didn't have the energy I needed to take care of home. You can\u2019t schedule vacation when you want. It\u2019s often denied. If you are new and want your kid\u2019s birthday off and a senior person wants the same day, they would get it. All of that adds to the stress level. Plus, I was struggling financially off of 55k as a single parent with 2 kids. I worked hard and sacrificed to get my s7, and s66 licensing.\r\n\r\nIt. is very hard to move out of the call center as every one wants to leave so there may be 5 openings with 100 applicants. So it\u2019s extremely easy to get hired but very difficult to get promoted. The pay is sub standard. Upper management (2-3 levels up) can be prejudiced and resentful. Location does matter. At my site, there were very little opportunities to move up and those who did move up were often the ones drinking and partying with Managemet on Friday nights. I\u2019ve seen my black high performing colleagues (top 3) get passed over for promotions for very trivial reasons. I wasn\u2019t using my talents. I left for a competitor and was hired on the spot for 40k more plus bonus and for a higher position in the company. They were able to see my worth and I\u2019m happy now and thriving. Thirty pounds came right off within 6 months.
