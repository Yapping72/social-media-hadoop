Name on the CV I guess.", "cons": "Where to begin\u2026The most toxic working environment I have ever worked in.\n\n1: Very Hierarchical. People, especially newly promoted VPs like to broadcast their status in the pecking order. If you spend too long at Analyst or Associate (over 3 years) nobody will respect you.\n\n2: Promotion process past Associate very opaque. If you\u2019re stuck in certain roles, good luck getting promoted further as it won\u2019t happen. Management want certain people to stay where they are as they can't be bothered to train people up to do their roles. Also, Management are unwilling to change the scope of roles to allow you to progress.\n\n3: Talk a good game about mobility, but in reality, very difficult to move to a better role. Management often  refuse to engage in conversations about career development, if the desire for development takes you out of the area you are working in.\n\n4: Very easy to get stuck in a dead end role and get pigeonholed.\n\n5: Senior Management in Operations treat us like children.\n\n6: Keep banging on about Diversity, Culture of Respect training etc, however this doesn\u2019t filter down to individual teams. Personally seen so many examples of bullying, racist and xenophobic comments, ableism etc which in any normal company would lead the perpetrators to be sacked. Been on the receiving end of a number comments and actions that would be considered bullying. Was personally told by a previous manager not to escalate a number of incidents I was on the receiving end of to HR as \"there's a very high threshold for what the firm considers as workplace bullying\"\n\n7: Management favourites are protected. Double Standards seemed to be applied daily.\n\n8: Incredibly Bureaucratic. Very onerous controls environment for no reason. Obsession with reducing costs\n\n9: Pay progression is below market value. Can often experience a real terms pay cut if your salary increase is below rate of inflation. Pitiful bonuses in Operations which seem to get smaller and smaller every year.\n\n10: Work-Life balance is for Management and Management favourites only.\n\n11: Feels like the firm is rushing back to normal because the CEO doesn\u2019t like work from home, and there are plenty of Middle Managers who love to micromanage and control their minions. Work from Home has arguably kept me at the firm for at least a year longer than I wanted. \n\n12: You are ostracised if you refuse to acquiesce to the culture and drink the \u201ckool aid\u201d.  Colleagues love to be nosey in your personal life and criticise you if you don\u2019t follow their way to live your life. If you stand up to people like this here, they quickly become vindictive and encourage other people put in spurious complaints against you."}, {"review_title": "Good company to work for", "rating":

You have a bunch of white billionaires attempting to show that they understand what is actually going on in the world and simply react to the topic du jour. There is no real strategy, only action for the sake of saying something about a topic.\r\n\r\nThere is a constant barrage of US-focussed messaging that is disenfranchising for international colleagues and creates an obvious sense of \u201cthem and us\u201d.\r\n\r\nOperating Committee members are openly stating that they are giving their MDs targets linked to Diversity and Inclusion. This can be loosely translated to \u201cquotas\u201d based on racial and gender profiling. This effectively makes it a hostile environment for young white men and there have been many examples of people feeling forced to share their harrowing backgrounds and difficult stories in an attempt to fit into the narrative and prove that they\u2019re not just some privileged white guy.\r\n\r\nThe general management style of ED+ is transactional and focussed on execution. A really good example of this comes from the very top: \"We want people back to work, and my view is that sometime in September, October it will look just like it did before,\" Dimon said at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council. \"And everyone is going to be happy with it, and yes, the commute, you know people don't like commuting, but so what.\"\r\n\r\nThis general disdain for staff percolates through the executive, senior and middle management levels. Middle managers often demonstrates elements of coercive control and psychological abuse through a pattern of manipulative behaviours and exerting power over a direct report, often through intimidation or humiliation.\r\n\r\nThe culture, particularly with the CIB, is toxic. Narcissistic behaviour is encouraged and rewarded.\r\n\r\nYou will rapidly go from earning more than your peers to being the lowest earner in your peer group. The compensation practices are designed to align you to the prevailing rate of inflation, regardless of your performance. There is a huge amount of secrecy around pay band by title, but it is easy enough to discover. When you get promoted, you will be given the title but not the compensation and will spend the following years just trying to scrape into the lower end of the range."}, {"review_title": "Very good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Analyst in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good place to work", "cons": "Not applicable all good nice place to work"}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Software Developer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great culture\ngreat work life balance", "cons": "Slow growth\nnot very steep curve for career"}, {"review_title": "Good place", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Hyder\u0101b\u0101d", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lot's of things to learn.\nProcess are very good.\nPeople friendly employee.", "cons": "Bonus is very less\nSalary is less as per market standard.\nOffice politics is there"}, {"review_title": "Avg place to work", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Quality Assurance Analyst in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Average company to work with", "cons": "Not good experience to work with"}, {"review_title": "IB job review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Investment Banking Associate in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great experience to work in different teams", "cons": "Bad work life balance and long hours"}], [{"review_title": "No WLB", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Intern", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Brand equity and the doors that this job offers", "cons": "no WLB, toxic environment and senior management"}, {"review_title": "NA", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Analyst in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Company and Better services", "cons": "Can't think of any cons tbh"}, {"review_title": "Great benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "30 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Account Manager IV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing company to work for", "cons": "Nothing wrong with the company"}, {"review_title": "Wouldn\u2019t spend a career", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "13 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Its a stable company. \r\nRegarded well externally and is a good springboard to better things.", "cons": "The culture is terrible and rewards duplicity. \r\nCompensation is below market. \r\nThe bureaucracy makes it difficult to get things done."}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Retired Bank Officer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work, good benefits", "cons": "No cons to list inn this section"}, {"review_title": "Good work life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Executive Director, Technology in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance\r\nMutual respect\r\nGood work\r\nInnovative", "cons": "Too slow \r\nRed tape is high"}, {"review_title": "Associate Vice President", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "26 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good culture, employee centric, customer centric", "cons": "Other than Low package, none"}, {"review_title": "Great resume builder", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Financial Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great coworkers and foundation builder for anyone in finance", "cons": "Nothing new to finance but no work life balance"}, {"review_title": "Specialist", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Workforce Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent career growth opportunities.
