You will probably make good friends with Accenture emloyees than your own company. There are a few scattered Company events but even these are being stopped to save costs. I once worked on a project for 2 years and in that time I rarely saw any Avanade collegues. \r\n\r\nPolitics - Avanade UK is extremely political. The extent of this made me throw up sometimes. Your achievements on a project counts for nothing. What counts for is how much you have networked with your \"Career Manager\". For this to happen, you need to master the art of praising your manager. Its how much you butter him up that matters in the end if you get promoted. It is a very nasty policy and I have seen many great people leave due to this. If your career manager himself is angling for a promotion then God help you. Most time the career manager himself is in a very busy project and rarely contacts you in the entire year.

Unlike other consultancies Avanade discourages overtime and actually sticks to that philosophy.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact there's clear performance structures around promotion, they are gamed: people set goals and are measured against those goals. This means a person could set themselves a goal of three textbooks, read three, and \"meet expecations\", while a person sets themselves a goal of one textbook, read two, and \"exceed expectations\". \r\n\r\nThere's lots of projects and they market the idea you get to choose and influence what you work on, but they don't tell you how to do that. (The way is to build close relationships with the salespeople and project managers, apparently. They don't tell you how to do that either, nor facilitate doing so in any way.) This means you do the projects you're given based on what's available, without much or any ability to steer the technologies you're working with.\r\n\r\nTraining is currently very disorganised in the UK (2016-2017). They promise a lot, but can deliver very little in terms of actually placing people on courses and certification. I managed to do some excellent courses, but had colleagues leave out of being unable to study and follow the lines of work they were promised on being hired.\r\n\r\nFlat management structures mean if two separate Avanade managers are telling you to do different things, nobody can resolve the difference for you. You either go over 100% to do both or you're thrown under the bus for failing to meet expectations. You will have at least three direct managers most of the time: a career manager within the organisation called a \"career advisor\" who is your go-to manager but has no project authority, and your project manager, and your team manager within the project. There are also business division managers (like software development manager, etc) but they don't tend to get involved.\r\n\r\nThe company boasts visions for how it wants to grow but those visions have never in my tenure related whatsoever to the software developers at the company. They are visions for the sales, marketing, and executive wings. The people on the ground (developers, engineers, analysts, etc) are expected to get involved but given the low control over what we do (we take work as it comes) there's no real way for us to do that, except via extra-curricular effort (and I don't know how we do that -- we're not told).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, extra-curricular effort is often required for promotions. We choose our goals out of a range, but the range often involves those business goals we can't influence. Things like creating and running an online training workshop help with career advancement, but creating that workshop and running it are done entirely out of your 8 daily project hours. (So when they discourage overtime, they don't factor in extracurricular activity and actively make room for it in your 8 daily hours.) Some of those promotion goals are not things we can predict: one promotion goal involves achieving certain goals within a project, but we can't predict that any given project will give us that opportunity, and we have to choose our promotion goals in advance.

This whipsaw effect tends to disorient consultants and build much less loyalty than management assumes. As an aside, the severance packages offered to RIFed employees is surprisingly low. This implies a lack of respect for those who have built the company and an inconsistency with stated company values."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work for technologists", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Jun 2011", "job_title": " in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Avanade provides technologists with excellent learning opportunities.

One should only be limited at Avanade by what one is willing to put into their career - in my experience a real \"meritocracy.\"  If one wishes to gain exposure to cutting edge Microsoft technologies implemented at the largest Fortune level organizations then this is the place.    Very compressed experience - for example, 5 years at Avanade is equivalent to 10 years of typical corporate experience.  Excellent salary, bonuses and benefits including top of the line health insurance, 80 hours of required annual training time and a technology purchase \"extended benefits\" budget of up to $2K provided annually.  Excellent training and best in class individual professional development support provided from entry level through junior, senior and executive level positions.", "cons": "Top tier IT services consulting is challenging and not for the faint of heart.  It takes absolute dedication and willingness to constantly compete in a stable of thoroughbreds to succeed at this level - especially at Avanade.  Experiences will vary over time and across projects and customer cultures but often significant personal sacrifices are required including near constant travel; demanding schedules like nights, weekends, getting up at 4:30 am on Sundays to fly across the country and getting back home at 9 pm or later on Fridays for months on end.  I've worked away on the road through more (and at home through major holidays) birthdays and family milestone occasions than I can recount.  Also Avanade in my view has become bloated around unnecessary and excessive layers of process, policy and internal oversight organizations seemingly needing to justify their existence through regularly implementing, changing and re-implementing Byzantine layers of reviews, approvals, added costs to customers and hoops to be jumped through leading to an inability to be agile around supporting innovative and new business development pursuits and opportunities.  These constantly increasing layers of processes spill over into other areas including performance review and delivery of customer projects.

Your career at Avanade will shape entirely based on this relationship.The manager is not changeable even if you have issues; you are expected to resolve them between the two of you. Many promotions are based on secret deals & fabrication (like employess threatening to leave with offer letters in hand) while hard working employees will be given a random reason & will be kept wondering for years, what they did wrong. You will not succeed here if you are NOT a self promoter. You are also laddered against your colleagues, so you will find the ones you are helping are actually working in competition with you; often bad mouthing you scared you will be promoted and not them.\r\n\r\n- Work/Life balance: If you don't push it you will lose it. Having Accenture as parent means they will try to bully you into their work culture which often means sitting down on client sites till late to show you are committed (whether you are doing something productive or not, don't matter). \r\n\r\n- Roles: Avanade depends almost entirely on Accenture for projects. As such a lot of roles you will be asked to do will be 'filler' roles which 'may' have a tech element that Accenture would make money on.  You will end up doing roles with no alignment to your specialities and a year later you will be told you didn't do a project in your speciality so no promotion or growth. This will happen year after year if you are not careful. Though you may see great clients on your CV, you will also look back and regret the roles you did as many roles you will not take up if you were looking for a job independently. They care about 'chargeabiliy'; not your career. Take roles with Caution!\r\n\r\n- Overall Experience: As per the point above, you will find 23 years old Accenture industry experts managing Avanade experienced hires with almost 23 years of experience. They will do best to keep you shielded from the client as they are 'trained' in corporate talk by Accenture. They produce processes, procedures, presentations & do the client engagement. You will do the actual work as the hidden tech monkeys! \r\n\r\n- Microsoft/Accenture: Your loyalty lies only to learn Microsoft. But in reality you will only work on technologies that Accenture make money on, so your loyalty in turn lies wiith Accenture. Relationship with Microsoft is just a con, they mostly don't work alongside Avanade due to obviously MCS being in direct competition with Avanade!\r\n\r\n- Company Direction/Hires: It changes more often than the colour of pants I wear. They recently got rid of a lot of founding members and senior employees, which to me seems like a suicide mission. They used to hire only experienced Microsoft geeks and was a place where MVPs had pride.

Culminating, most recently, in the layoff of more than 200 professional across the U.S. from every practice and at every level.  It\u00c3\u00a2??s quite evident that the layoffs were numbers driven based on a limited view of the business as I am aware that once the broader organization became aware of exactly who was laid off they quickly scrambled to rehire or contract with some of those who were let go as there were now large gaps in capabilities that needed to be filled to support new business.  \r\n\r\nSadly, even after the 8.14 layoffs Avanade continued to lay off more consultants in a onesy  twosy manor as they moved to the new Customer Care Organization structure.  This action continues to erode the morale of the company and many talented people are already exploring other opportunities.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Avanade became very risk adverse and lost a lot of its agility.  Accenture senior executives were astounded at the rigors Avanade would go through to review and approve the smallest of deals.  Avanade had definitely started to mix sales with delivery and it hurt the organization.  They have definitely fallen to the Microsoft side of risk aversion scale and that became evident to their customers/prospects as well.  Part of this is due to the Delivery organizations involvement in Sales. \r\n\r\nAvanade tends to be buddies network where if you are part of the in crowd then you don't need to follow process or procedure.  I have seen several people get promoted without the proper documentation.  Furthermore, I've seen senior management negatively impact the careers of many talented individuals solely based on personalities.  The organization tends to be passive/aggressive and most comfortable in decision by committee so as to limit the risk to the individual.  This makes for extremely arduous and lengthy decision cycles at all levels.\r\n\r\nFinally, it has been a rumor for years that Accenture would fully absorb Avanade and now it looks more imminent than ever.  Accenture told Avanade c-level execs to get bigger or get out and Avanade has responded by trying to build their direct (non-ACN or MS channel) business.

With how we were so distributed across the country and how we were staffed on projects (many times without anyone else from the actual application group), each consultant was his own island...until needing support from others using the email group.  There was no true way of getting into the 'in' crowd unless you were staffed on a large project that needed attending by the application Director.\r\n\r\nMy CM and my director never got to know me or my true skill set because of the island.  That was truely too bad for Avanade and for me.\r\n\r\nThe other major con was the sales life cycle.  I think the process used for sales and closing deals is a HUGE obstacle for shoring up what's in the pipeline...to the detriment of the consultants.  The overall sales life cycle was/is way TOO long and overly complicated with checks and balances for most small and mid sized projects.

I'd say the culture is in line with the relative ownership percentages of Accenture (81%) and Microsoft (~19%). While Accenture is certainly a large and prestigious organization, they are also rather clumsy to adapt to environments, organizationally bloated and have a habit of overworking employees. This has most definitely made its way into Avanade.\r\n\r\n2.) Area \"design\". As of my departure, the areas (e.g. Desert, Mountain, PacNW, etc...) were becoming quite top heavy and there was really no way for upper level employees to progress since there was generally one director per area (this did change a bit with some minor restructuring however).

If you're a low level employee, expect to work a lot - and get paid little for it. I've had numerous downline reports overworked (60+ hours for 6+ months) and they got very little to show for it. Even worse, if you're a mid level (35-45 in the old leveling system) you get no overtime. When overtime is paid, it's paid only for the difference between the hours worked and 50 hours, so if you work 51 hours, you get 1 hour of straight time. Expect people to take advantage of this fact - they do. Sadly, the company doesn't do a lot to address these issues.\r\n\r\n5.) You'd better really like Accenture. That's their bread and butter and they've changed the business model around repeatedly to support it.

In addition, some of the industry knowledge and processes from Accenture provide a firm foundation for understanding what is going on at your clients.\r\n\r\nOn the technical side of the house there are some great people.  They really know how to implement Microsoft technologies to provide innovative solutions to business issues, when allowed by Avanade's internal workings.\r\n\r\nTechnical training is another great reason for a real techie to work here.  The reason Avanade ranks high with regard to training is because of the availability of self study courses that you can take advantage of.", "cons": "Avanade's internal processes are probably the worst I have seen in more decades of working then I want to admit.  It seems as if the only answer to any issue is strap on another process developed by someone detached from the client facing, revenue generating side of the business.  Processes rarely are retired, just added to.  Numerous clients have been quoted as compared to Avanade their own processes look positively good. (Many of these were government clients) \r\n\r\nAdvancement is an issue at Avanade, if you are in one of the larger offices you seem to do ok. However Avanade prides itself on its virtual work environment, however those who do most of their work virtually suffer in advancement. Just another disconnect at the highest levels.\r\n\r\nAvanade is primarily owned by Accenture and it can be an issue.  While Accenture successfully pursues most very large projects, Avanade focuses on much, much smaller gigs.  Unfortunately the push from management is to adopt the same policies and procedures Accenture uses in multi-million dollar pursuits for Avanade\u00e2??s hundreds of thousands and smaller pursuits.  To address this, you guessed it, Avanade straps on a process to \"lower\" the overhead, but it actually takes at least as much time and effort to get management to sign off.\r\n\r\nAnother way Accenture dominates the work is that there is considerable staff augmentation where Avanade people provide the Microsoft skills on an Accenture project and we seem to be at their mercy as to what we are allowed to do.  Often we complain about our treatment on engagements but it is not paid much heed.\r\n\r\nThe culture is also very risk adverse.  This tends to drive up estimates and we lose a lot of business because we over estimate, over hedge our bets, over use legal language and over plan in the effort to minimize risk to Avanade.  This often presents itself in proposals that are much more than what the client was thinking the wanted and were willing to pay for.  A lot of business is lost here after copious amounts of work.  Conceptually this is to reduce the risk of a project not meeting Avanade's expectations; unfortunately it is really due to a poor project management capability even though there are some pretty good project management methodologies and estimating models available to the project teams.  Unfortunately the delivery side (project/program management people) rule what does get approved for sale and the Sales side is very weak as far as influencing how we pursue revenue.\r\n\r\nAlso. as others have noted, all bets are off if the unrealisticly  high goals set by fiannce and management are not being met.  At that point expect to be sent on anything that may bring in a fast buck."}], [{"review_title": "Great training, benefits and access to Microsoft resources", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Jun 2010", "job_title": "Senior Consultant in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Avanade is a joint venture between Accenture and Microsoft.

Following this, I feel obliged to warn people considering joining this firm (or any other 'consulting' gig like this) with sobering facts that I've witnessed\r\n-During my stint, I witnessed DOZENS of such lay offs as described above within just one fiscal year\r\n-If you are on functional team ('Business Analyst', 'Consultant', whatever), only skills you are building is Microsoft Word (how to write documents) and front-end Microsoft technologies (AX, CRM, SharePoint, etc). Most projects are IT implementation body-augmentation projects where the most interesting work you could ever hope to do is to talk to clients and write down their notes. If not, you are stuck for months on 'testing' the system, doing garbage work such as writing test scripts, etc. I would be surprised if anyone thinks such tasks are either interesting, or if anyone actually believes such job experiences helps your career from skill-set standpoint\r\n-Mediocre coworkers in terms of talent. I've met many people here who couldn't do 6th grade-level algebra. Now that I think about it, you probably don't need much intellect nor skills to do the job at this company, at least on the functional side...\r\n-Very little skill development: if you go up to a manager-level employee on the functional side, and ask him/ her to do a simple task in Excel or SQL, chances are overwhelming that they probably couldn't do a thing. Actually, most likely, they probably don't even know what 'Pivot Table' is or 'Left Join' implies, which testifies to the lack of skill-set growth on jobs like these.\r\n-This job, in most cases, leads to a dead-end career. If you are happy to do mindless IT implementation work for the rest of your life doing tasks like testing, documentation, or what not, this is the job for you. If you actually want a job where you can expect to do some type of data analysis, or where using your brain is not frowned upon, don't even consider taking this job. (or other 'consulting' gigs like this one - Pure IT staff augmentation gigs)\r\n-Overall, this job gets a terrible review from me (and a lot of people I knew at the firm shared the sentiments above) due to: lack of job security, lack of interesting work, lack of project work, lack of skill-set growth, extremely political working environment, and lack of 'normal' working conditions (you need to travel to random places weekly for this gig)\r\n-One last remark. One time a coworker that used to be on the same project as me doing 2 months of 'testing' the system asked me why I looked so depressed.

I would not recommend this company to anyone with more than 10 years of experience. If you have 0-5 years - great place for an education. 5-10 years, you can probably learns some things that will help you polish existing skills. The main difficulty will be surviving the travel commitments to accumulate enough seat-time to actually learn something.\r\n\r\nThis is a company that is largely geared towards developing junior resources.\r\n\r\nThe travel is a grind, and will generally eat up most people in the first 6 - 12 mos. If you have ANY kind of family or personal life that you value, this is NOT the job for you.You (or your spouse, sig other or kids) will quickly learn to hate this job - you're paid well, but essentially never around. Usually doesn't end well on that front.\r\n\r\nYou can expect 60+ hour work weeks, every week, and that's in addition to whatever travel commitment you have.

See the comment above about '...will tell you anything you want to hear...'\r\n\r\nYou can expect 12-15 hour days that frequently span offshore hours. That doesn't change very much from client to client. A large portion of the work you will do will be managing the client because the company likes to sell. Sales sells, and Delivery tries to deliver. GIGO (Garbage IN, Garbage OUT).\r\n\r\nExpect zero work/life balance when you're on the road. They own you, and the expectation is that you're spending most of your days dealing with politics, general mismanagement and sales/contract fallout, and evenings doing your 'real' job'. The typical funny comment is when you get to 6pm and people say, 'ok, what are we ordering for dinner'?\r\n\r\nCareer Management is a joke. I had no CM meetings of any substance with my CM in 8+ months. The only time I heard from my boss was when things were not going well.

Managers have very outdated ways of thinking, and believe that extensive processes and methodologies are all that is necessary to successful project delivery.  They cling to an antiquated methodology that insists you can eliminate all uncertainty on projects and a \"one-size\" fits all development approach, at least within the ERP practice, which leads to disastrous results.  Project managers who have no working knowledge of the product they are implementing are valued over consultants who do all the legwork for clients.  Project managers are valued for handling clients well instead of leading effective teams.  Overall, working hard is valued over working smart.  HR representatives and career managers don't always look out for your best interests, and even when they do, they can't overrule senior management to help you.  Your colleagues may be smart, dedicated, hard-working employees, but poor  management leads to constant thrashing on projects.

Avanade is an Analyst factory - built around taking newly minted CS grads, hiring them at the Analyst level, and training them up to be productive contributors. Eventually. Most of their training and support programs are optimized for the inexperienced worker. One example of this is the lack of any true defined career path, and the lack of opportunity the more senior you get. In fact, the round of layoffs that occurred at the end of February saw a large number of more senior people ushered out the door. No one will admit to this, but they were just making way for a bunch of cheaper, new college grads. \r\n\r\nIn spite of proclaiming that \"Delivery excellence and agility are at the core of everything we do\", the organization has no respect for the role of Project Managers. Instead, at least half the projects are run by some senior technical resource that has been put in place as a Delivery Lead. Yes, they go through the same delivery management training and certification process, but they lack the years of experience managing projects that actual PMs bring to the role of Delivery Leader. Further evidence of this is the increasing tendency to move the PM role to one of their off-shore organizations. After all, to Avanade, a PM is just a glorified secretary and accountant, only in place to take notes, and keep track of the project financials. \r\n\r\nThe other thing that gets in the way of achieving \"Delivery Excellence\" is the complete disregard for a person's skillset or career interests. Avanade tends to do these \"student body left!\" shifts. Last year, it was Azure. This year, it's \"Robotic Process Automation\", or \"RPA\". RPA is just a fancy way of saying scheduled tasks, but you can charge a whole lot more for it when you lump it in with \"AI\" and \"Robotics\". Or, at least that seems to be the thinking of Avanade executives. But, that's not the point. My point is that, regardless of what skills you brought to the table, or professional interests you had prior to joining Avanade, you either get in line with the most recent \"student body left\" shift, or find yourself back on the job market when the next round of layoffs happen. You joined Avanade because you're a Sitecore developer, and you were sold on all this \"digital\" work Avanade is doing in Sitecore? Too bad! You're going to learn all about Active Directory and go be part of an Active Directory migration! You're going to learn all about Azure, and how to provision servers in Azure. You're going to learn Blue Prism, and how to automate business processes. You don't get on board with that, expect a bad review and no promotion. How are you achieving Delivery Excellence by staffing people who have just been through just-in-time training and have no real experience with the technology they're expected to go deliver?\r\n\r\nExpect to travel - A LOT. They'll tell you that they've moved to a \"regional model\" and that most travel will be in region, but the reality is, unless you happen to live near one of the few major cities where Avanade gets a lot of work, you're going to be traveling wherever there is a project that needs to be staffed. Unless you happen to work in Seattle or Chicago, you can expect to be on the road almost all the time. And there's absolutely no regard for work-life balance. You're expected to travel as the project needs. You need to be there first thing Monday morning - fine, you're traveling Sunday night! And there's no leaving early on Thursday - generally, you're not leaving the client site until after 3 PM on Thursday, so unless you happen to be staffed pretty close to your home city, you're not getting home until late. And then back at it Friday. And your Friday will be filled with training classes, Talent Community meetings and Market Unit meetings, as corporate has mandated that all non-client meetings be held on Friday. That's not a bad idea, but I bet the corporate wonks that make those decisions have any clue just how many of those non-client meetings Avanade field employees get dragged into every week.\r\n\r\nYou'll read elsewhere in this forum about how things have gone downhill since Accenture \"took over\". That may be - I don't have the history to confirm that. I can say that my observation is that you have two organizations with completely different cultures. The majority of projects that Avanade people get staffed to are actually Accenture projects, so you can expect to have to deal with a culture that you didn't sign up for when choosing to come work at Avanade. You'll get pressured to do things that seem borderline unethical - at a minimum, they're in direct conflict with what your management staff will tell you is the right thing to do. You'll be treated like a second class citizen by these Accenture folks. \r\n\r\nWhich brings me to another point: The non-field employees have no regard for the people working in the field. You try contacting an HR person or a staffing person, or even someone in your talent community management chain, and you'll be DAYS waiting for a response. More than likely, you'll have to email them multiple times before they respond. And expect some terse response that probably doesn't even address the question you asked! I don't know what it is those people are spending their time doing, but they have their priorities all wrong - their first priority should be taking care of the people interacting with and delivering to their customers. \r\n\r\nWhich brings me to my last point: Staffing is a joke! In between projects, it's completely up to you to find your next project. Beginning Day 1 you are encouraged to \"expand your network\" to increase your odds of getting staffed. That's because the tendency of these Delivery Leads is to staff people they know. On the surface, that sounds good - you want to put the best people you can on the project, right? So, if I've worked with Sally before, and she did a good job for me, then why wouldn't I staff her? Without someone centrally advocating for a new hire to be staffed to a project, how are they ever going to be? As a result, you get these new hires that end up sitting on the bench week after week, being pressured to get themselves staffed. That's not a good way to begin a working relationship. But - for a fresh college graduate who's never experienced it done a different way, they don't know any better!"}, {"review_title": "Mixed bag", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "21 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Director in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Training opportunities, flexible lateral moves,  established policies/systems/processes.

In the last 2 years, way too many of the Avanade clients are companies are either in serious financial condition and/or they are IT shops that have not been upgraded or properly maintained for at least 7 years or more. Nothing more depressing than consulting on trainwrecks, especailly when they are lead by people that have never had a success in the last 5 years. \r\n\r\nSelfish management structure.... If you are not one of their chosen few, your career is going to be totally static...December 2011 promotions  list included way too many poor technical performers who were in bed with senior managers. Also, Avanade has been acquiring the \"hand me down\" worthless leaders from Accenture for the past few years. Just go to Linked in and look at the Avanade profile and look at the senior leadership....It looks like the dumping ground for the Accenture rejects.  \r\n\r\nEmployee review process in 2011 was totally dishonest. Too many final employee ratings got changed downward by one full level by corporate after the ratings calls and efforts leveled everyone. \r\n\r\nCompensation/Raises for Decemeber 2011 were terrible..... Anyone looking at Avandae should look at the number of senior level people that quit in the month of December 2011. A company that saw a 46% growth in revenue and had a great year year is handing out 2-5% raises for the technical people and equally pathetic STI bonuses. All this means is that the senior leadership is lining their pockets at the expense of the revenue generators. Of the people I know that left, all were getting 15-20% raise just by going to their new companies. \r\n\r\nCommunications: Worthless and unprofessional..... \r\n1) STI (Bonuses) that were payable 12/7/2011, no one got there letters confirming their STI prior to 12/10/11..... \r\n2) Resignations and people leaving are never communicated to the remaining staff. \r\n\r\nWasteful Fluff and garbage gets sent to you as pretend compensation. \r\nRemember the scene from \"Blazing Saddles\" where the Governor (Mel Brooks) and Attorney General (Harvey Korman) hand out bunch of Paddle Ball toys in lieu of real pay? Avanade is almost that bad!....  I have a closet half full of garbage that I will never use that has been logo'd with \"Avanade\" all over it... If they had not spent the money on this garbage and  the postage to send it out and just send me a check, I might have stayed. For those of you Avanade fanatics, check eBay in January 2012, I will be posting this crap up for sale (Cups, coolee's, magnets, mouse pads, towels, frisbee, flashlights, pens, mice, travel mug, and a bunch of other stuff ranging from dust collectors to utterly useless.)."}, {"review_title": "Used to be great, now it's okay with pockets of bad", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "20 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Manager in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Compensation seems fair, the benefits are pretty good\r\nReally nice people\r\nExposure to a variety of new things", "cons": "Always serving three masters (Avanade, Accenture, and your VP)\r\nWaste money on fancy meetings instead of investing in the business\r\nSlow to make decisions and take action\r\nIneffective and inept middle management\r\nFiefdoms are prominent\r\nEasy to get pigeon-holed"}, {"review_title": "Manager", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "15 Dec 2016", "job_title": "Manager in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible about working from home, great/smart people and I feel that the work we do has a positive impact.", "cons": "A lot of internal organizational changes that is affecting engagement and mistrust in various parts of the organization."}, {"review_title": "Digital Workplace Culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "23 May 2017", "job_title": "Senior Director in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Variety of Clients to collaborate with and partner on and or even lead innovation.\r\nAccess to Microsoft's leading technology and leverage of Accenture IP. \r\nWork anywhere. \r\nFlat structure. \r\nHighly skilled and intelligent people.", "cons": "Decision to promote people is done in calibration which means hard to promote talent to next level once they make it to middle or senior rankings."}], [{"review_title": "They did a bait-and-switch on me", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Jan 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Solid insurance, decent hours, variety of clients", "cons": "They pitched the job and the project to me as something completely different.

As a consequence, employees are passing exams by studying exam questions that are available online, they don't actually learn anything, value of their certificates is equal to zero.", "cons": "This is by far the worst company I ever worked for. I have very hard time understanding developers who say this is a good company. Inside Avanade, projects are managed using Avanade Delivery Model (ADM) which is just their fancy name for the waterfall development process. Yes, the waterfall, that thing we all now is bad and should be avoided, but Avanade sells is to the clients as modern, state of the art software development methodology, so if you are thinking about working for Avanade, better be prepared to spend most of your time writing mountain of useless documents. All the work that is performed in Avanade is maintenance of legacy systems, which are usually big balls of mud, so forget the idea that you will learn anything about good practices of software development and how to apply them. Also you will not learn anything from your colleagues because most of them (including seniors) are pure amateurs. Wanna know how do they merge of one branch into another? By copy-paste. Yes, you read that correctly, developers copy-paste code from one branch into another and Avanade managers tell their clients this is the best practice. And if you only dare to say anyone this is wrong and not how things should be done, then you can forget about advancing in you career. Speaking of which, inside Avanade you only have one linear career path. You start as associate software engineer, can advance to software engineer and then to senior software engineer. From there you can only progress to analyst, but don't let this name deceive you, these analysts are not business analysts, they are not even analyzing anything, they are something like junior projects managers, not managing entire project, but just small part of it. Their job is to push developers to their limits in order to satisfy unrealistic deadlines, and also to produce a bunch of reports that will make the clients think they are getting some value, while they are actually getting terrible quality products and a bunch of documentation saying that these products are best thing that ever happened to them. From there you can progress to senior analyst, and then to project manager etc. So if you are someone who is passionate about technology and want to have a career of software architect, well... unlucky. Senior software engineer is the highest position in Avanade career path where you actually do anything related to the technology. Also when you start working for Avanade they will tell you that they have very clear career plan process and that your career only depends on you, which is a total lie, they career plan is a joke and the only thing that matters when it comes to promotions is whether you kissed the right butt or not. If you are a developer, and passionate about what you do, I strongly suggest you avoid Avanade.
