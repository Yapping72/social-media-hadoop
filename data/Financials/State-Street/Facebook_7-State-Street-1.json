Expect to be blamed for issues that are the direct result of hiring untrained people.

The teams doing the bulk of the work are paid the least. Bonuses are ever-shrinking, even in years with record profits.

I worked in onshore for State Street , and worked in Hyderabad as well but the experience is entirely opposite . If you are a woman and have a voice and if your seniors/ managers are all men then just forget about getting the respect and things that you deserve. Patriarchy is there in this Indian management which is not there in all teams but most teams has it. There is not much work also and hence at the end of the year you can\u2019t even demand that you did a lot and deserve.
