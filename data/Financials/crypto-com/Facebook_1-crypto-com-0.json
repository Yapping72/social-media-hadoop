Also paints a good picture internally but proceeds to lay people off suddenly with no tact, just an email from HR to personal acct and people realizing they got locked out. \r\n-The salary is pretty poor, considering that the bonus and rsu vest in small amount in the 1st year. A lot of people did not manage to get bonus or rsu either since they got laid off. \r\n-Would not recommend anyone to work here as management has a total lack of regard for employees.
