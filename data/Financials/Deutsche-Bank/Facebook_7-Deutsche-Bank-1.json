Treasury contributed toward this initiative significantly and this is acknowledged across the firm\r\n\r\nTreasury has some incredibly smart people who you can learn from\r\n\r\nFor a department that is traditionally very technical (capital, liquidity, issuance, irbb etc), there is significant focus on soft skills, which is extremely helpful for personal development and enhances saleability when looking for future jobs\r\n\r\nIt is possible to have a great work life balance. Treasury provides a job for life if so you desire, slow and steady, especially in Frankfurt and more recently London. This comes with its own disadvantages though. Its up to you to push yourself\r\n\r\nIf joining from externally and you negotiate, salary can be excellent. Benefits are also excellent. Bonuses are OK. Total packages are strong", "cons": "Technical excellence seems to be valued below soft skills in the internal value hierarchy. This leads to poor outcomes for a department which by its nature deals in technical topics. \r\n\r\nPart of DB's overhaul includes cost cutting. This has been felt negatively in Treasury and Finance in multiple ways. \r\n\r\nCareer progression is possible in the long term but happens at a snails pace for anything other than the more junior levels due to cost pressure. You may find this frustrating, unless you are happy with slow and steady. \r\n\r\nThe firm is extremely bureaucratic and slow in some areas. It can be difficult to get things done. Cost pressures mean areas like technology suffer, making it even more difficult to get things done.\r\n\r\nSalary rises occur by exceedingly rare exception, mainly for juniors. Salary freezes are frequent for multiple years, even for top performers. Make sure you negotiate the best possible starting salary!\r\n\r\nLike many large firms, DB, and TSY in particular, is very far from a meritocracy. Its possible to tick along and receive no medium term outlook difference in ratings appraisals etc against those who strive for excellence. High ratings are also a function of time in the firm in many cases. \r\n\r\nDue to cost pressures, hiring freezes are common. External hires have not been possible in many instances, meaning roles must be filled internally. This can cause issues in deeply technical areas, a brain drain has occurred in Treasury over the past year or two."}], [{"review_title": "Too many Chefs in the kitchen", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Information Technology", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Team is great to work with", "cons": "too many chefs and not enough cooks"}, {"review_title": "Associate review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "9 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is good company to work for", "cons": "No cons identified as of now"}, {"review_title": "associate", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Associate in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nothing.

My direct team, manager, and stakeholders I worked with have been some of the most supportive people I have encountered in my careers and it\u2019s a shame the company treats everyone so poorly. The benefits however, are great. Depending on title, you can start off with 20 vacation days which is a lot for US employees. There are fertility benefits for women that provide generous financial support in IVF, surrogacy, and freezing eggs with is huge!", "cons": "To be clear, this review is about Deutsche Bank as a whole - not my team, or any of the people I directly worked with. Where do I even begin - internally the company is a mess beginning from the onboarding phase. Why do you need documentation of all my prior jobs and copies of my degrees if you are running a background check against my resume anyways? Not a great start. For an investment bank that has been touting all its success on various platforms DB is shamelessly cheap. During the pandemic, HR (and junior bankers) were given no support for our work from home setups. I was forced to use my personal laptop (which by the way was 6 years old), purchase my own desk, monitors, keyboard, and mouse. When I asked for reimbursement I was told by senior management VERBATIM \u201cyou work at an investment bank, you can afford it\u201d (I was certainly not making investment banker salary in HR). Then 6 months in they allowed HR employees to come into the office and take our monitors, chairs, etc. ONLY because they were mothballing the floor in anticipation of the office move - such a hollow effort because 1. Everything was going to be trashed anyways and 2. We all had our setups at that point. There was a lot of turnover on my team because the workload was unrealistic especially since we were always short staffed. We had a lot of turnover in 2019 after the restructuring announcement then a hiring freeze so my team was incredibly under resourced for a full year. We were not given additional compensation for going above and beyond, just a simple pat on the back. Another point on the the restructuring process and \u201clocation strategy\u201d - nothing like signing into work everyday during a pandemic and hoping its not the day you are restructured or your position is moved to Jacksonville because it\u2019s a cheaper labor market. When I resigned, there had been a series of resignations from my team in close proximity to eachother. I asked for a counteroffer and DB did nothing to even attempt to retain me therefore making my former team suffer from the continual cycle of being understaffed. This company doesn\u2019t care about its employees, it cares about the bottom line.

Now that the old site manager is gone and a new one is hiring with honest postings, no one actually wants the job. Probably why they lied in the first place.\nManagement is a joke, there's no plan, no training, no one helps each other, especially between regions. It's basically the uppers complaining about things until someone hopefully fixes it. They roll over when other teams push back, which means there's no consistency in how to operate, and no documentation to refer to how it's actually supposed to run.\nEveryone is so swamped with work that there's no time to do the 'Automation' job that we were supposedly being hired to do. It's just user support issues. They took away the level 1 support so now both jobs fall on the production teams. Tasks that should be handled by the devs are also on the production team, again because the leadership just rolls over and doesn't stand up for their team.\nOn the occasion someone manages to get on a call with the uppers to raise concerns. Their solution is to stop having those calls with the teams. Mention this to the site managers and they laugh and do nothing about it. And they wonder out loud (again complaining instead of planning) why everyone is quitting.\nNo one is willing to help each other. There's no training. There's nothing to learn. The things you waste your afternoon talking about that's supposed to be 'training' never get used.\nThere's no documentation, not even for the users, who come to you constantly for advice on how to use a program you didn't make. You get yelled at for not resolving issues that you can't fix. You get yelled at for doing something that you thought was policy because someone complained so that's not policy anymore. You're constantly on the hook for another teams work that you're waiting on, and there's no accountability if they don't fix the issue because again, leadership just rolls over.\nThe people you work with a nice enough, because we're all in it together, but I don't know a single person there that's happy to work at Deutsche Bank."}, {"review_title": "Balanced place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good work life balance and nice people", "cons": "deal flow not good enough"}, {"review_title": "Super supportive team", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "8 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People are extremely friendly and supportive", "cons": "Little slow paced and its difficult to break silos"}, {"review_title": "Good company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "14 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good compensation\r\nGood facility and infrastructure\r\nGood location", "cons": "Long working hours is a con"}, {"review_title": "Company review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Risk and Control Analyst in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good organization to work for", "cons": "Work pressure at some times"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Vice President in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good culture\r\nGood salaries\r\nGood work life balance", "cons": "Too chaotic at times due to global nature of jobs"}, {"review_title": "Kyc job profiles", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Feb 2022", "job_title": "AVP-Operations in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for", "cons": "Banking is a volatile sector"}, {"review_title": "Good company for the beginning of your career", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Devops Engineer in Bucharest, Bucuresti", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wide range of technologies and multicultural people", "cons": "Product implementation can take longer then you expect"}, {"review_title": "Ehhh", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Senior KYC Analyst in Jacksonville, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Unlimited sick days and excellent health care benefits", "cons": "A toxic environment breeds unhealthy competition.
