Glad I didn't look there before applying ;-)\r\n\r\nCollaboration is paramount and everyone at the company is a Slack message or lunch table away.\r\n\r\nWork/life balance is something that I thought might be lacking with such highly productive, driven teammates, but to a person, weekends and evenings are respected and it feels like everyone knows they do their best work when properly rested and recharged. \r\n\r\nKnowing you are contributing to such an important mission is really the best \"Pro\".", "cons": "This is the classic \"Con\" that is actually a \"Pro\", but with the talent bar so high, it makes recruiting more challenging.
