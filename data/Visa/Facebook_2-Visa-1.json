I was transferred to another team after a year and was able to better utilize some of my skills and experience. Unfortunately, given the change of the company direction, my role changed again - back to the \"filling holes\" mode. Despite I delivered high quality of work and received very positive feedback, I was not given any opportunities to move forward. I had been proactively looking for internal opportunities and I finally found a role that matched my skills, experience, and levels, but I was not allowed to apply as they said the position was 2 levels above me. (That level used to be one level above me and HR added one more level after I joined.) My qualifications, skills, and experience were way beyond the requirements. Even the hiring manager and my manager expressed the role was right for me. Unfortunately, Visa puts policies and rules higher than people. They look at levels far more important than skills, experience, and capabilities in the selection process. If I was not a Visa employee, it was likely for me to at least get an interview. The hierarchical culture was unbelievably strong and rigid at Visa, even more serious than many traditional Asian-rooted firms. I do not think the management has any idea.

Flexible work schedule when returning to the office\n3. 4 weeks of remote work per year, manager pending", "cons": "There are so many cons to Visa that I don't know where to begin. Here are four in no specific order:\n\n1. Terrible leadership. Leaving our CEO, Al Kelly, aside for now, Visa is ripe with terrible leaders that could not care less about their people. In my years at Visa, I've prepared well over one hundred decks for a specific C-suite individual, providing the materials for the vast majority of his presentations. Not once has this individual ever stopped by the team's desk to say hello, not once has he ever stopped by with so much as a thank you. He doesn't appear to have a care in the world for his people or their careers. \n\nAs far as Al (CEO) is concerned, he's a little better but falls far short of me being able to give a thumbs up. In my time at Visa, the most commendable things Al has done are #1 expand the employer contribution of our 401k plan to 2:1 with immediate vesting, and #2 committed to not laying any employees off due to COVID-19 for the remainder of CY 2020. These are commendable, but also not overly gracious given that the 401k match was in response to Trump's tax cut and 2020 was a year of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus to help employers avoid laying people off. At the same time, thousands of employees at Visa have not seen their wages change in two years (2019-2021), despite Visa doing over $10B in share buybacks in that same time. In short, Visa puts its people dead last, oftentimes as a footnote to its shareholders and clients. \n\nMy biggest complaint of Al, however, is that he does so little to intervene in (let alone fix) issues amongst his lieutenants. I believe he knows how bad things things are and how poorly some of his direct reports treat their functions but he doesn't do anything about it. I think part of this is his physical separation living on the East Coast while the vast majority of his employees live in California. He seems detached and I question how involved he is in building a better corporate culture. \n\n2. Consolidation of power at the top. Visa has a huge problem with consolidation of power at the top, oftentimes amongst men. These select few (Al, Ryan, Vasant, Jack) call most of the shots and they aren't open to other's opinions. If you're looking for a collaborative environment where you can have a voice and drive change, my experience has been you will not find this at Visa. Instead, this is a command-and-control environment.\n\n3. Incredibly poor career progression. This varies by team and function, but many groups have terrible career progression. In my experience, I've seen managers and group heads actively try to block their employees from pursuing new opportunities. What's more, these same leaders will oftentimes engage in frequent nepotism and are not incentivized to help their people's careers. As a result, people's careers are oftentimes stalled out for years with nowhere to go, sometimes with a manager actively showing favorites, sometimes with a manager actively sabotaging his people's career development. \n\nIn this same vein, there is little correlation between performance and career development. Visa does little to reward or promote top performers. Your best shot at seeing career progression may well be the person in front of you leaving the company for another opportunity.\n\n4. A lack of positive corporate culture. In short, items #1-3 drive a poor corporate culture. Relative to other companies in the Bay, Visa's corporate culture is extremely lacking.

Devs don't get much time to build much tooling to make their lives, or their QA lives easier. \r\n\r\n-processes are very complex, manual, and poorly documented\r\n\r\n- developer velocity is very slow\r\n\r\n- code quality is a joke most of the time. Things tend to get shoved together because of a deadline coming up. Frameworks get used incorrectly. Then things get re-written since they become an unmaintainable nightmare and the process repeats. \r\n\r\n- some management initiatives are a net loss (i.e. required code coverage, absolutely NO rollbacks). \r\n\r\n- have to enter every hour you spend on every project into tracking system (rally) which \"is not used for performance\" but feels like it is. Then use another tracking system to track the code changes (jira), and possibly other tracking systems (wiki/teams). It is an unorganized mess.\r\n\r\n- wiki is slow and search is very bad. Finding accurate information is difficult.\r\n\r\n- tons of gatekeepers and \"onboarding\" processes for integrating with other teams. These processes SUCK, when new infra is built, it is not built in a way to be easy to integrate (i.e. lots of meetings and manual steps).\r\n\r\n- release process is terrible. Use of wikis to keep track of release information and release instructions. The process is not automated, not consistent. Some of the releases have jenkins jobs but even then you need to add your instructions on how to trigger the job for ever release, and a guy in ops must do the release, teams can't release without ops involvement. Releases take a long time and are error prone. It takes DAYs to prepare for a release, and must involve several people.\r\n\r\n- case in point with release process - it once took 3 months to get out a trivial bug fix, that customers were running into (there was a work around, but still, a bad experience), simply because the release process was so terrible and we have \"code freezes\" . The change was fixed for months in lower env but kept getting de prioritized due to the work required to do the release!!! \r\n\r\n- since releases are so difficult rollbacks are expensive, there is a lot of pressure to get it right, which means development moves slow. Also, upper management (ie 3 levels above my boss) crap on me and my boss if you do end up making a mistake which requires a rollback. Stressful! Sometimes I wouldn't be able to sleep at night because I was worried about a release going bad!\r\n\r\n- since there is so much pressure to get releases right, and it is so difficult, lots of changes end up getting bunched together, decreasing velocity, increasing coordination, and increasing risk. \r\n\r\n- gatekeeping by humans in testing environments! You have access to do stuff in dev, but in qa, signoff (pre-pre prod), SIT (dev integration), and cas(pre-prod) you don't have control and you have to make a bunch of jira tickets to get something done, then you need to ping the person assigned to the ticket to work on it cause they are super busy with other stuff..... Should be automated!!!\r\n\r\n- Bangalore collaboration is a pain (I worked in US office). Some work like perf testing or tightly coupled dev work is done by counterpart team in Bangalore. This means you need to stay up anywhere from 8pm-12am to work with them, while they also have to wake up early or stay work late in order to meet with you (timezone is ~10-12 hr diff). I have even seen some engineers from Bangalore staying until 2AM (their time) just to meet with our team here in USA (how is that ok for non emergency??)! What doesn't get done in person must get done over email, so it slows the process even more. The Bangalore teams have excellent engineers, but the time difference makes high collaboration work stressful! \r\n\r\n- lots of penny pinching for projects. I guess it is somewhat normal since companies can't just spend money on whatever, but getting a project funded is loooong and painful process.\r\n\r\n- so many approvals, including getting rubber stamps from architects that are very disconnected from your projects, it seems to rarely catch problems or enhance the designs (in my experience), and ends up being a big time waster.\r\n\r\n- a bunch of TOI (transfer of information) sessions. Rather than having everything clearly documented and easy to find you need to schedule a meeting with someone to learn how stuff works, almost on a daily basis.
