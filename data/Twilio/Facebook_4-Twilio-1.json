Twilio took so many chances on me, and I'm grateful for that. \r\n\r\nI love the people I work with and feel like I've found a workplace where I can fully be myself and be appreciated for me. While there's a bit of hierarchy and politics day to day, people genuinely want to help each other and make the company more successful. There's a spirit of togetherness that I love seeing every day. \r\n\r\nAnd an amazing culture of innovation. My coworkers are constantly thinking through how we can make products, processes, and people more efficient. They genuinely care about what they do, and our follow through as a company for what we commit to is incredible.\r\n\r\nOur sales team is killing it, support is doing a whole lot with very little, facilities are my favorite people, and product keeps coming up with brand new ideas to make cool things happen.\r\n\r\nTwilio treats its employees well. We may complain about the lunch line and so-so benefits, but the sheer amount of care that's put into things like our company all hands and our new hire training experience shows the company's dedication to its people. \r\n\r\nJeff is an great leader and sets an amazing example. Management, on the whole, are caring and well intentioned. We've had some really incredible new managers from internal promotions who I enjoy working with.", "cons": "Ok, so some of the less glamorous aspects:\r\n\r\nTwilio's model for designing and shipping new products has... shall we say... some areas for improvement. There's an almost exhausting race to find the next biggest, brightest thing to go after. As a result we have a lot of floundering old projects because we're bad at retiring products but really good at running at breakneck speed towards the next new announcement. Churning our products quickly creates engineering issues. Also, it's just plain exhausting for our engineers and it drives marketing to insanity for every launch.\r\n\r\nAnd we preach wearing the customer's shoes, but the shoes we try to wear are a tiny group of customers who will generate the most revenue. Product Managers are missing exposure to a larger set of customer issues that literally prohibit some users from adopting Twilio, and there's no easy way for them to get more expansive qualitative feedback.\r\n\r\nAlso, most importantly, Twilio is essentially propped up by a subset of really, really amazing executors. We know informally who a lot of these people are. Lots of them are employees who have been at the company for many years, like myself. They have a lot of institutional knowledge. And they are quitting. In droves. It's not unexpected in a post-IPO world, but the company seems highly reactive when a valued hard worker with tons of tribal knowledge announces plans to leave. I hope HR has plans for retaining what small long-standing talent remains or keeping people who've been around for a while more united. Especially within our sales force, where the majority of employees are new and reorgs are not uncommon."}, {"review_title": "Chaotic process, lacking product leadership", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Comp\nBenefits\nTypical tech company perks", "cons": "Very chaotic process for choosing what to invest in, little objectivity and customer input despite these being core values.\nStill a founder led company, all decisions go through him which is not scaling well at all.\nPress/event driven product roadmaps with little customer value shipped.\nMassive number of betas and products in market with a handful of customers on them, unclear how they can continue to innovate without systems and processes that enable it.\nCEO will agree with an idea or product until he doesn\u2019t, not clear how long you\u2019ll have alignment or how to get it again."}, {"review_title": "Best employment experience to date", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Tons of opportunity for ownership, leadership and advancement\r\n- Successful, stable company with clear growth trajectory \r\n- CEO and other executive leadership are down-to-earth, approachable, but also brilliant\r\n- International / Global presence and offices everywhere, easy to work remotely\r\n- Really yummy food on the days they feed us\r\n- Inclusive and rich company culture that looks for \"culture-add,\" not \"culture fit\"\r\n- People around you are Doers\u2014they are leaders in their own right and  love to do and make and build\r\n- Extremely competitive compensation package", "cons": "- Pretty young design org - some growing pains in leveraging design methodologies across the company\r\n- Some silos among and between teams- that's not always bad tho"}, {"review_title": "New Hire Experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "From the initial recruiting to interviews and on-boarding, the experience with Twilio is different.

Twilio is an awful place to work as a salesperson.  They have been having a sales hiring surge over the last year after the new COO came to Twilio from Salesforce. He is trying to make Twilio into Salesforce's image and is making it a terrible sales culture. So much change in territories and comp plans that it was impossible to build a pipeline. The comp plan is so hard to understand that reps just give up trying to figure it out. (30 pages long) Twilio pays comp 4 times a year. 45 days after the end of the quarter. And when they do pay comp it is usually wrong. There are constant battles between sales, operations and legal. The processes are so arduous to follow and they are constantly changing. And you better watch out if you want anything done quickly.  The legal and operations teams have no sense of urgency. and if you do need something done outside of the process they will penalize you for it .  There are so many cliques at Twilio that if you are not in the \"cool crowd\" then you are isolated and ignored. Favoritism is rampant. Reps who are favored get all the good leads and opportunities. Executive sales leadership is the worst I have ever experienced.  They do not value salespeople who color outside the lines and if you upset the wrong person  you get fired for  some trumped up reason. If you don't fit into their sales model then they find ways to make you exit the company.  Cutting territories, moving people around and reassigning accounts and pipeline.  If you have a problem with management don't go to HR. All they do is tell your manager what you said.
