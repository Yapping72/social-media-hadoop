They also may tell you whatever you want to hear during training. If you work here be prepared because they may require you to work on the holidays regardless of if you already worked your 2 for the year or if you were told that since you started working later in the year and the trainers tell your entire class that you won't have to. Be prepared for monthly audits with the focus being solely on what you didn't do well. . . That can be discouraging to say the least. We don't get enough times to actually call customers back and follow up on their cases. If you're a Cigna customer and wondering why that rep you spoke with hasn't called you back like they said they would, it's because management only gives them a 15 minute window to make calls out to customers and providers. Annnd some days those 15 minutes get removed from their schedules because the phones are busy. Everything is based on the needs of the company, which should have been a ref flag for me the first time I heard a supervisor say that. Calls are back to back with an allowed time of 35 minutes for the entire week to wrap up calls before jumping back in the queue. The phones auto answer so they literally just roll in. Every call is recorded (audio and your computer screen during) and during those monthly reviews you will have to listen to some while getting scrutinized. Doesn't feel like the goal really is taking care of the customers, the goal is really the metrics and adherence. You don't pick your lunch or break times either, they are loaded into your daily schedule, and it can vary daily. You may come in at 9:00 and your lunch be scheduled for 11:00 but your day doesn't end until 5p and maybe you prefer you lunches to be at the midway point or later in your day. Well too bad it's just there and if you go outside of when it is on the schedule you are out of adherence and your score goes down. Overall it's not a good department to work in, there may be surprise mandatory holidays to work. I say surprise because the day ofter Thanksgiving (Black Friday) was on the list for the Holidays that we were to have off for 2021. Early in the month they asked for volunteers and when not enough staff volunteered, they told us that we would all be working that day. It's a call center job, a very strict, empty feeling call center jobs and for me it's not the customers, I get why you're pissed off about a bill you didn't know you were getting but it grinds my gears to have supervisors who don't take escalated calls and to have an escalated call because a customer is upset and wants to speak to a manager and now we gotta twiddle our thumbs together for and hour and a half to get someone to FINALLY talk to them because the supervisors don't even know how to take phone calls and how we have to find someone who can. Why do the supervisors not know the answer to basic insurance related questions. They seem to be there just to hover because they definitely can't assist you with a call.

Other cons would be ancient point of sale technology that they have been saying they will upgrade for at least a decade.
