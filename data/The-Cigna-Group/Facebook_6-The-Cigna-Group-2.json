The work environment was extremely toxic, a very high percentage of associates would take a leave of absence for stress related illness within a year of working for the company. The organization I worked for did not have an HR department or a Training and Development department so HR related issues and training fell on the supervisors or mildly tenure associates (associates with the company 1-3 years) which led to the supervisors being overworked and underpaid. The senior manager was not a leader at all and only cared about herself and spent a majority of her day focused on building her dream home and planning her wedding instead of interacting with her associates. She was rude and would barely speak to people if and when she was in the office.

As an employee, I have had several opportunities for advancement and growth.  In an 8 year career with CIGNA, starting at \"the bottom\", I've been able to work my way up and have been promoted 5 times.  \r\n\r\nCIGNA  is a company that fosters professional growth through tution reimbursement and through it's intensive library of internal training materials (through CIGNA University) in a vast range of topics.  CIGNA also offers a service called Books 24 x 7, which allows employees to access digital copies of books on buisness, information technology, human resources, and personal well-being topics.\r\n\r\nCIGNA has a dedicated middle-management staff concerned about their employees.  CIGNA provides ample time off (2 weeks of vacation when you are first hired, with the option to purchase a third week through payroll deduction, and they give you an extra week of paid vacation once you reach 5 years of employment).  Benefits provided are well-rounded (including medical, dental, pharmacy and vision insurance, short-term disability, long-term disability, and various dependant care plans), although it is important to know that CIGNA employee benefits are not richer simply because CIGNA is an insurance company.  Like most companies, employee costs for insurance benefits have increased in the last decade as overall health care costs in the United States have become more expensive.\r\n\r\nInformation Technology professionals at CIGNA will find an environment that fosters innovative thought, although administative \"red tape\" barriers are cumbersome.\r\n\r\nCIGNA is a company with innovative programs and anyone considering employment can be assured that hard work at CIGNA can result in a very satisfying career.", "cons": "CIGNA departments tend to exist without proper communciation levels that can lead to headaches.

Most IT professionals prefer spending time doing IT tasks, but CIGNA IT professionals typically find that about 15% of their time is spent focused on jumping through administrative hoops.  Application development at CIGNA requires a significant amount of planning, and securing funding for large projects requires employees to prove that their project will result in hard-dollar savings.  Minor application changes require approval by senior IT leadership, so the process can challenge the patience of even the most level-headed IT pro.\r\n\r\nAll-in-all, don't let these downsides discourage you from working for CIGNA.

I never loved it there.  When they went to Banding - as opposed to the salary grades the Administrative Assistant lost ground from the midpoint to the  market value.  Of course this benefited some - mostly the higher ups who were already making alot of money.  The money  is not good and the raise are lousy - maybe  good year is 2.5% no more.  Also, when you work as an AA, I had two situations where my managers kept adding in more and more people for me to support.  This was done so he/she could appease the peers they had and the matrix partners.  So essentially I was working for the same money - no compensation was given for the extra work, there was no reward for the extra support at the compensation time and it was a demoralizing feeling but I was being required to please more people and it couldn't be done all the time.  Most middle managers - (maybe not all, but alot) - and this applied to the Band 4 and Band 5 managers have a strong sense of entitlement and feel superior - they can be rude and mean to those below them.   I think this results from them making so much money and have an overestimated sense of importance.  They get away with treating others like dirt because when push comes to shove the higher manager will tend to give then the benefit of the doubt and/or back them up.
