Provided laptop/monitor (which you can't take out of the office) are top notch. Lockers provided have enough room for a bag and other items to fit into.", "cons": "THE BAD\r\n- Being deadline and delivery oriented: This may inherently be a problem of the nature of IT/business, but its ultimate priority is to have a good image to its customers and ensure consequent money in-flow (profit). In order to retain the image of being on-track to its customers, the pressure to deliver a potentially shippable product per sprint (2-3 week time frame of work) is put on lower management and developers. Code is made to be externally working and superficially bug free, without necessarily having a solid, well-designed code base that considers expandability/modularity/rigidness of the system. Refactoring is rarely done to improve code. Technical debt rises, possibly to an unsavable degree.\r\n- Rigidity encouraged in its way of work/scrum: You're expected to be incrementally working each day. It won't sound good in a status meeting if you say that you spent a day on improving your programming skills in order to do better at work (this is related to the first point) without spending an hour or two on your delivery.\r\n- Rewards those who have statistics to show: In the company, metrics is highly a key (since as I said, image is important). Test coverage and learning indices are valued too much, even if though those don't necessarily reflect actual quality of work. Bug fixing is glorified because it can easily be quantified in terms of number of bugs fixed, but promoting good design in software development or code reviews, which could -prevent- bugs in the first place, are not because they cannot really be quantified in the same manner.\r\n- Inconsistency: Only occasionally practices what it preaches (e.g. \"quality first\", promoting software design principles and best practices), because of said being deadline and delivery oriented.\r\n- Scapegoatism system: if someone can be blamed, he/she/group might be blamed. The unfortunate premise here is that a person/group is expected to be responsible for something that goes wrong, and not necessarily the systems in place at work (e.g. cutthroat way of work as per being deadline and delivery oriented).\r\n- Work done can be so tedious yet mentally unrewarding: one can spend a week or two on fixing bugs or working on pre-determined work instead of being able to actively design the system. Even if one is able to \"move up\" in his/her career path and do design/architecture, the existing code base of the particular business line already presents a number of structural problems that one might be left to settle with workarounds suggested by developers, instead of being able to have an ideal design/architecture. One is only partially able to improve as a software developer in doing programming work, and so he/she will need to seek it outside of work during his own free time.\r\n- Trainings: Too much time is spent on mandatory trainings that are not always relevant to the developers (trainings such as that relating to company culture). Programming trainings, on the other hand, are subpar because the management would prefer to have the bulk of time allocated for actual implementation of deliverables. Trainers who are pressed for meeting deliverable deadlines are, thus, only able to churn out lecture slides that they read out for the most part, promoting passive learning.\r\n- Overtimes: The pressure to deliver makes people overtime even when the management does not ask for it. And when they actually do, they might end up prying on your reasons for not being able to do overtime.\r\n- Not much extra-curriculars: This is probably due to both time priority being given to meeting deadlines and budget not being allocated for such activities all that much (delivery-oriented). The burden of making time and money for extra-curriculars becomes the employees\u2019 burden.\r\n- Food sold at the pantry is so-so, with little variety.\r\n\r\nTHE NEUTRAL (depends on you)\r\n= Pay will only scale well if you\u2019re able to prove through metrics that you\u2019re essential to the company, and that task will come with the challenges presented in writing above.\r\n= Little work variety: Regardless of role and unless you\u2019re in upper management, you'll probably still be working on the same project, over and over, dealing with the same concepts in different configurations and permutations. This could last for years. May not be everyone's cup of tea. That said...\r\n= Work output is rarely tangible: Unless you've reached the point/target year where your product has already been released, you won't have anything tangible to be proud of. No showing your family/friends how cool your new, little Play Store app is. You're almost never going to be able to brag along the lines of \"I made that.\"\r\n= Market of your product limited by social class: When the time comes that your product is released, only those who can afford will be able to use it. It's not that cool Play Store app that everyone with a gadget can download or voluntarily donate money to.\r\n= Time flexibility isn't really so flexible: This may also not be specific to just Nokia, but your free time is affected by the consciously/subconsciously encouraged mid-shift working hours. While the reasons why people come to the office a bit late (10 AM, or even beyond) is complex and not simply company-rooted, this nature of the schedule is also influenced by how one needs to interact with counterparts around the globe (especially in Europe, who are 6 hours behind Philippine time).\r\n= Need to study telecommunications apart from actually implementing code, doing architecture, etc: You're encouraged to spend significant time studying, and yet there is little time to thoroughly do so because of deliverables.\r\n= Little practicality of non-programming, technical concepts outside Nokia: If you're not for embracing telecommunications and network engineering concepts with all your heart, it's not the company for you. Maybe 75-90% of what you learn won't be usable for other IT companies that aren't TelCo. Add this with the fact that you're also not much mentally rewarded on the software development aspect.\r\n= Constant interaction necessary: Because of the incremental style of work, you may also be required to talk to people everyday. If you're an introvert or looking for variety between your days, I doubt you'd like this kind of constancy.\r\n= Open office environment may not be for everyone. Depends on your style. Unfortunately, it's hard to consciously be alone because of said need to interact to deliver requirements to proper spec."}, {"review_title": "Cost cut driven culture", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "1 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Business Transformation", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Well positioned with 5G and high innovative company.

Interestingly the head of Nokia Research is based in the Palo Alto lab and not the Helsinki/Tampere labs. Within the first year, pretty much met and got a chance to talk to every big wig in Nokia and quite a few from outside.\r\n\r\n- Each individual and team has *a lot* of freedom in terms of responsibility and to some extent budget, to go out and do what they need to (within scope of Nokia's current or future business interests). This seems to be unique to the Palo Alto lab.\r\n\r\n- Has a startup feel with flexible hours, free catered food, interesting guests each week. Flat organization so a lowly researcher can walk in and have a chat with the head of research about a new project.\r\n\r\n- People are encouraged to perform and are rewarded on basis on Ps - Patents, Publications, Prototypes, Publicity.\r\n\r\n- Lab itself has a very organic feel to it with large screen displays, fancy artwork, bean bags and colorful walls.\r\n\r\n- Compensation is comparable to other top places in the Silicon Valley (though not the highest) but unlike lot of research labs has a variable component which may fluctuate based on Nokia's fortunes.

You sometimes have to convince the product group managers or their bosses that your research is not a threat to their livelihood. Also, have to fight the tendencies of product groups to grab the low hanging fruits of the research and discarding the main outcomes.\r\n\r\n- Tech transfers can take a lot of your time towards the end of a research project, due to reasons given above.\r\n\r\n- Some teams are too focused on academic publication oriented research while others are too focused on system type research.\r\n\r\n- Management of individual teams varies with some more loosely managed than others.

I worked for R&D as software engineer. \r\n\r\nThe #1 gain for working for Nokia was people I got to work with. They were intelligent, kind, reliable, funny, professional, determined and many other positive things. I keep contact with many of them after leaving the company many years ago and consider some close friends.\r\n\r\nThe #2 pro was the flexible and supporting organization Nokia used to have. It was easy to transfer from another project, and they tried to fill vacancies internally first. I would not say that career development opportunity was great (it wasn't) but if I wanted to transfer to another project at the same level, this was relatively easy.\r\n\r\n#3 pro was the interesting and innovative projects they had. Nokia used to be very innovative and had an eye for future technologies and innovation. The old organization NRC (Nokia Research Center) was a good example of the innovative spirit. The company also strongly encouraged patent (IP) filings.\r\n\r\nThe rest are not in a particular order: great brand recognition, product visibility (my family and friends used a Nokia phone and talked about it), good training/development opportunities (they had a large number of internal courses and was also generous to offer language courses etc. for foreigners etc.), international career opportunities, sense of security of working for a large, international company .", "cons": "The #1 con was the rapid decline of the organization that started in mid 2000, leading to the eventual acquisition of Nokia by Microsoft including the former's personnel. Reorganization and streamlining happened so often with the 'bad news' i.e. another round of lay-off. This demoralized everyone, and everyone was forced to look after him- or herself. Though the company did support internal recruitment, prioritizing these internal candidates under lay-off threat over any other candidates, the turmoil was very damaging to employees' moral and motivation. \r\n\r\nI do think that such a decline can hit any IT company. But Nokia did not handle the difficult time well and it could have handled it much better.\r\n\r\n#2 con was the increasing amount of ego and selfish pursuit of one's own goals and needs over the company's that started to become more visible in the early 2000. Nokia hired a great number of young still-in-college engineers during its rising time in late 90's. They were purely fascinated to work for Nokia because they wanted to create great products. They got to work on cutting-edge missions, traveled internationally,  and wanted to become even more successful. Then, something happened: many of the engineers became more political, wanted to pursue their own successes and status even at the cost of the overall success of the company. \r\n\r\nNokia was practically only viable option for IT professionals who wanted international, \"big\" careers in Finland. I think that this created the sadly unique disadvantage that too many of the talented but ego-ridden IT professionals saw Nokia as their devise to achieve glory, success, status etc.\r\n\r\n#3 con was lack of career progress opportunities. As above, I found it quite easy to get be involved in another interesting project in a similar than current role. However, if I wanted to go for a leadership-path (project managers, project leaders etc.), these coveted roles were generally passed onto someone the hiring manager already knew. If you were an engineer or software architect who wanted to go for that path, it seemed virtually closed for them.\r\n\r\nThe rest in not a particular order: not pushing people towards excellence but mediocracy, lack of great leadership, mediocre financial compensation, the HQ (Nokia House) is great, but many other offices were not inspiring"}, {"review_title": "Great for a first job", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Oct 2016", "job_title": "R&D Engineer in Athens, Athens, Attica", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Nice environment\r\n- Not so \"deadly\" deadlines\r\n- Stability \r\n- Good starting point for a person (regarding the environment)", "cons": "- Lack of inspiration \r\n- Many different tools between products while there is no need for that\r\n- Low salaries \r\n- Too much routine \r\n- Career opportunities?

Much of this stagnation seems to be the result of how difficult it is to actually get a feel for the impact on products of what you do every day.

This is quite embarrassing situation for person like me who was left with an option to take an unexpected and preterm exit from there .\r\n2. Too many cooks spoil the broth . This saying sets a classic example while working at Nokia ..All PM's, Stream Heads , Sub Stream Heads, Lead Architects,SI - region Head(s) all trying to race with each other one & only simple task - i.e. Estimation of work . The real ground work is often being done by junior engineers and sub contractors made to work like slaves.\r\n3.

Every new morning there is a new policy with GDC overridden by the earlier version . Policy makers themselves have not experienced the facets of day to day challenges and equation of work . To be precise , these policies are related to travel, hiring, PO, training, processes for project execution, project KPI's on Quality & more .\r\n5. No technical engagement for anyone joining as a TPM . Roles & titles have a huge disconnect and falls apart . \r\n6. Working in the role of a Project Manager you would never interact with your end customer , you will never have any control on project team , no control on project risks & ways to mitigate , project costs and what you are implementing as a solution .
