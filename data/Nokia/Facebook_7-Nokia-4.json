The mobile networks business while sizable is too cyclical and low margin mostly due to overwhelming opex costs.  I also feel Nokia for its revenue and market cap size has a significantly large (>100k) employee base which will continue to hinder the company\u2019s resurgence as a solid and nimble competitor to Chinese and American counterparts.
