The Jacksonville office was so poorly managed. Management had \"corporate\" things to take care of so it was like the low level employees had to act like managers. At most companies when a customer is pissed off, they ask to speak to a manager. At Tesla, we were taught to do everything in our power to not let these frustrated customers speak to a manager. Our managers NEVER wanted to speak to customers. And honestly, I don't blame them because there was not much they could do most of the time. There were so many times where a frustrated customer would say, \"can I speak to a manager?\" and I just had to say \"No, I'm sorry. No manager is available.\" And a manager probably would never call that customer back. It was honestly unbelievable. One time a guy flew up from Miami to pick up his vehicle and when I got in to work, we found out the car was in a completely different city. I had to walk into the waiting room and tell him to his face that his car was not there. This man flew up and got a hotel room to pick up his vehicle that was in a completely different city. You would think a manager would go and speak to that customer, but no. The guy who had been there for about a month had to go inform this gentleman of this news. Stuff like that happened every day and there was nothing you could do about it. There are probably more competent people working at Dollar General than this place. One of my managers messed up my co-workers paycheck one week because she thought she went out of town. My co-worker barely got paid that week when she worked almost the whole week. That is just unacceptable and a perfect example of how incompetent the management is at this office. I was underpaid for a pay period as well and my boss told me she would correct it. It was not corrected and I had to conduct a meeting with her. She really didn't care that I was not paid correctly. I would think as a manager, you want your employees to be happy. How are they supposed to be happy when they aren't being paid?"}, {"review_title": "Internship Review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Internship in Palo Alto, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.

Lots of ghetto people building your luxury cars and only care about a paycheck. - Lack of accountability.

Managers will be hanging together, sharing stupid memes on their phones or shopping on Amazon, while the line workers are sweating like crazy and getting injured. - Injuries are frowned upon. Management doesn't like it when you report injuries -- they like keeping a high safety score -- but they also give you crap and consider you incompetent if you do get injured. - No 401k matching. - Slow or no career trajectory. If management doesn't know how to succeed, they sure won't know how to help you succeed. Many managers are still lost little boys and girls, who've miraculously made it to middle age. - Safety issues. If you report a safety or ergonomics issue, better expect for multiple people to get injured first before they'll do anything about it. - 12-16 hour work shifts are not uncommon - HR is a complete joke. They WILL give you the runaround. Very condescending and don't care about you. Take it or leave it attitude. They are not there to resolve any actual problems, but rather to keep deflecting until you quit. - IT support staff are rather condescending. Some people are nice, but most will think you are stupid.

In talent sourcing, there is no process for how requisitions are distributed. Recruiters will bombard you with reqs and when you tell your superior, the response is, \"Tell me how you would like me to address this\". This isn't management. \n- Zero discussion on career growth, goals, etc. Never came up once in my 2+ years\n- They only talk about the stock price since there is no other positive topic about the company\n- Confusion around coming into the office. \n- Recruiting \"Managers\" are really just individual contributors with manager titles. They literally do the exact same role as recruiters and sourcers. They don't implement process or mitigate issues. \n- everyday something chaotic happens. roles that you've been sourcing for weeks and been told are a priority are all of sudden not a priority or eliminated all together.\n- no KPI's. None. How do they determine top performers. no one knows...\n- PTO is \"flexible\" but not encouraged at all!\n- Managers do not take criticism well."}, {"review_title": "Excellent Place to work.
