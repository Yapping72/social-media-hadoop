I'm not sure what the vetting process is like for the leadership team in CA, but they seem to continuously hire people who are unqualified, unintelligent, unprofessional, extremely rude, and overwhelmingly narcissistic. The worst part about this job is having to communicate with these people. They are some of the most vile, hateful souls I've ever had the displeasure of working with. And the issues start at the top. There is rampant unprofessionalism, hostility and animosity present at every level of the autopilot department. Mentally and emotionally, this is a draining environment to be a part of. People are not treated like people and no thought is ever given to how anyone in the department SHOULD be treated. It's absolutely disgusting. Worst of all, this obvious unprofessionalism problem within the company trickles all the way down to the lowest employees, who then get blamed for the problems, rather than leadership ever taking a look at how they contribute to the problem. Seems to me that there is a maturity problem here, people, including the supervisors, act like they're in high school. It's a toxic environment. \n\nAttendance policy is absolutely ridiculous. No unpaid time off is ever to be given and PTO trickles in at a laughable pace. Management encourages using sick time for anything you want, and then holds it over your head when your time gets low. If you run out you basically get fired if you ever need any extra time off. \n\nThe path for extraordinary employees to move up the ranks seems to have been designed by someone with no experience in how workplaces actually function. The process for earning a promotion is tantamount to a gameshow where making it to the end is basically dependent on your luck. You can give this company everything you have and then will promote someone else who does half the work, but just happened to get the right judges for their gameshow rounds. Too much bias among AP leadership, especially among those in California. Working here is a waste of time if you have any aspirations to move up, they will just promote someone who has worked here for a month and has done nothing to earn it. If Tesla cares at all about keeping good employees, they should be promoting much more based on merit. They say that somehow \"isn't fair\" while promoting people who have not put in the hours of extra effort, who do not give 100% every day, people who do not care about making Tesla a better company to work for.\n\nCalling this company a \"start-up\" at their current valuation by the stock market is an absolute joke, but they still function like one. Unfortunately for people like me who see greater opportunities for the company to evolve, we do not matter. There is no path to making things better.

That's about it.", "cons": "First and foremost, let's start with hiring. The hiring process is a joke. You do over the computer interviews and you have to do an assessment before being hired. The assessment is nothing like what you'd be doing once you actually get onto the floor. They make it look easy, when in all actual - every work flow is different and doesn't even touch the surface of what you were told to do for the hiring assessment.\r\n\r\nOkay, now let's talk about once you're hired and your first few days.\r\nYou go in on the first day and you do paperwork, the usual. They go over their pay, pto, rules and regulations yada yada yada - honestly whatever, it's a joke and I'll get to that in a second. \r\n\r\nBut, you get picked for a workflow. Depending on what flow you're in, you only get a certain amount of time to learn it, and even when you learn it - you don't really know it. Their training lacks big time, and they don't have the proper training skills to teach a bunch of people things, especially when people do learn differently from everyone else. There is no accommodation to there. Here's a powerpoint, be expected to know it in 5 days - and best believe you need to have a 100% FQA rate to even feel like you're learning. They make it impossible and the QA'ers (some of them) pick and chose what they want to score you on - it's not consistent. \r\n\r\nYour workflow can change at any time - and just when you become comfortable in one place - you have to start all over. They give you no notice that this is going to be happening, it's kind of just do it and if you don't like it, oh well.\r\n\r\nThe job is only hard because management makes it hard with their lack of training.\r\n\r\nEven that, my biggest issue with the company overall is HR and management. They don't know what they're talking about half the time, and god forbid you professionally try and confront them on things, it's game over you put a target on your back. They don't follow procedures and policies from the handbook, especially when it comes to pto. You are told you get ___ amount of pto hours, ____ amount of sick time, and when you get there, all of a sudden the hours are less from what they told you. The time you accrue should be able to be used when you want within enough notices time, and the company does not honor that either. They pick and chose when they want to allow people to use their time.\r\n\r\nOh, don't have a death in your family - or god forbid your parent is put on life support. They don't care. They take all of your sick time - and if you don't have much it's well we have to write you up for this. There is no remorse for difficult times. But yet the company expects you to show up and give 100%? Yeah okay.\r\n\r\nAdvancement. They talk about it on your first day. Oh if you show that you wanna move up and you wanna go to lead or supervisor this is how you do it. Unfortunately, if you don't turn into one of their robots, you don't get to move up. Again, you put a target on your back if you even try to defend yourself. You speak up, stick up for yourself, and management shoots it down every chance they get. They don't listen to you.\r\n\r\nYou will go unheard of at this company. You won't be taken seriously. Your feelings and opinions won't matter. HR is a joke too, they don't care about anything except getting paid. They don't like you reaching out to them to ask \"HR questions\", instead, they tell you to follow up with management who ultimately doesn't have any answers for you.\r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and just don't. Find a different company. \r\nYou will be just a number here.

If you're good at sucking up and would rather focus on seducing your supervisors instead of bettering the company, get ready to open your legs. There is evidence where supervisors are sleeping with each other and benefiting from it, but HR turns a blind eye about it. If this seems to be the environment you thrive in, apply. You'll fit right in. \r\n\r\nWe had a supervisor(a) who obtained evidence of other supervisors(b) committing nepotism. Once they tried to report it to HR, not only did HR do nothing, supervisor(b) altered supervisor(a)'s performance review and had her fired on the spot. \r\n\r\nDon't believe in their lie where they care about your suggestions on improvement. They accept your suggestions but don't bother to do anything about them.\r\n\r\nThey pre-select people for promotions based on favoritism rather than output/skill. They still go through the formality of letting anyone apply for the promotion, but time after time we see people who are not qualified for the position promoted. Upon further research we realize it's because of nepotism. Don't get me wrong, there are some wonderful people that are leads/supervisors but they are all planning on leaving. They were the only reason why I'm still in this company. After learning they are all leaving, I'll be leaving too. \r\n\r\nThere is no flexibility in work hours. I do think being late is unprofessional and tacky BUT they do not offer flexibility in their clock out times. Let me explain. Work starts at 9am. You can clock in 5 minutes early or 5 min late (8:55-9:05am) and you won't get in trouble. You can be 30 minutes late but you'll have to make up the time. Anything after 30 minutes is a verbal warning/write up. This is reasonable. I 100% agree with this. BUT. You must clock out at 5:31pm on the dot. If you clock out 1 minute early (5:30pm), you're written up for leaving early. If you clock out 1 minute late (5:32pm), you're written up for committing unapproved Overtime. We're using UKG(Kronos) for our time cards. Mistakes happen! The website glitches all the time. Sometimes you clock out, but the input didn't go through and you'll be accused of not clocking out correctly and written up. The supervisors refuse to acknowledge this and say \"They are unable to adjust your timecard '' which is utter bs because they've adjusted my co-worker's timecard recently. Supervisors are salary and do not use UKG(Kronos) so they don't understand the glitches we experience. \r\n\r\nYou can participate in a raffle to test drive their Model 3, but you're actually working for free and they are collecting data from you. The vehicles are disgusting and are not properly cleaned. This is 100% not the company's fault that people are disgusting but they can get the car deep cleaned monthly (at the very least). \r\n\r\nThere are a LOT of people in the lead/supervisor position that absolutely do not deserve it. Not only are they oblivious about their team/workflow, they push you to do more while they sit around gossiping or walking around just to monitor you. They are thankless and are quick to punish people. They do not know how to motivate their teams, only know how to say \"your workflow is the unhealthiest\" when they increased our goals/numbers a few days ago before we had a chance to reach it. Beware of DT. If you know, you know. They don't know how to recognize people, they don't even know how to read their own stats and don't know how it works.\r\n\r\nThe pay is $22/hr (not a livable wage). Other competitors start at $35/hr with a better work environment and similar, probably even better, benefits. A LOT of people don't last more than 1 year. We had around 1000 people in California(Oct 2020), over half of those people quit (Nov 2021), NOT fired/laid off, and they are now hiring people in Buffalo, NY (cheaper labor). \r\n\r\nSo many unnecessary meetings (even after Elon has an article and emailed us about not having these meetings). \r\n\r\nHR can't touch the AM/PM/Supervisors. If they slack off, hide their mistakes and blame others, they get away with it. \r\n\r\nIf you're still interested after reading all this, be my guest to apply. This crowd is right for you. The interview process is a joke, the only requirements are to be a high school graduate and be able to navigate in a 3D environment. It helps if you have a great attention to detail. Bonus points if you're attractive (probably a guarantee job if you're a 10 according to society's standards even if you're a dunce. \r\n\r\nIf you can last for long term, the RSU that vests after 4 years may be worth it? You will have to sacrifice your mental well being dealing with the toxic environment.

Data is often undervalued, or analyzed improperly, or over-extrapolated and used to jump to improper conclusions. The desire for data to fit in with specific narratives (in the interest of hitting short-term goals) often overrides critical thinking in guiding decisions.\r\n\r\n\u2013 Equipment/process/manufacturing design is done too hastily, preventing designs from being as robust as they could be.

There is a quarterly vehicle supply cycle that demands every 3rd month you nearly have kill yourself with required hours, there is a zero regard for your work/life balance, so everything else in your life suffers as you work 10+ hrs/day for weeks on end with no days off. The company provided so little of what was required regarding people and resources and demanded you make do with so little, it's no wonder this resulted in a downright embarrassing customer experience that you then were the personal face of. The delivery facilities we worked out of and where customers took possession of the new very expensive electric vehicles were an absolute joke that never improved, and fit and finish quality of the vehicles themselves which is widespread known as awful took all the pride out of working for the brand. Our job was largely to mask/cover these up to deliver the max number of units as possible, it was a dishonest ugly practice. If I could sum up in one word what Tesla lacks and is reason for this scathing review, it's simply: integrity \n\nIn addition, they were completely dishonest with staff during the beginning of covid regarding the potential risks to their health, and it's no surprise to hear of the disgusting racist hateful culture that exists in Fremont. It's a toxic corporate culture that only getting worse with its rapid growth. Their apparent solution, move to Texas where it's easier to continue there with their terrible ways.\n\nThe days that Tesla can leverage their early monopoly in EV's is coming to the an end, and their competition stealing all their best talent (at time I left about only 1/5th remained on my team from when I started) for obvious reasons like Rivian and Lucid is going to eat their lunch with a far superior quality product and a worthy customer experience for the high amount of money they demand.\n\nUltimately, I sincerely hope they improve or more so completely turn it around, as most important is the adoption of electric transport to make a meaningful impact on climate change.
