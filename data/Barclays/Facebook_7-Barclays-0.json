People got mixed messages from the middle managers on which offices can wear jeans and which cannot dress down at all. Came to a point wherein the regional COO had to be called in to clear up the confusion. Talk about cra-zy!\r\n\r\nThen there's that flexible, work-from-home benefit being promoted as well, but guess what?  People who wanted to do that in the SG office had to file for paperwork and get Director-level approval, and this process took practically a month. And this approved period is good only for 3 months, and can be revoked.  Most applicants don't even stand a chance, they get shot down immediately by their direct line managers.  Reason being given is that there is a different impression when people work from home, that the productivity is not that high and your appraisal gets hit if you do so. Yet interestingly, they do not account for are those late-night calls with London and New York offices and still expect people to be in at 10am despite being in meetings until midnight the previous night.\r\n\r\nIt does not end there...\r\n\r\nThere's this weird practice of firing people on redundancy in January, and then the bank gives the crappiest bonuses to those IT staff who are left behind.  The director delivering the bad news starts with this glum \"the-bank-didn't-do-so-well\" speech, then hands over the insulting numbers.  Think 2-3 DAYS worth for an annual bonus despite getting a \"Fully meets expectations\" rating in your appraisal.  And then give it a few days and the big bosses announce the company profits. Kind of insulting, especially since we have to pick up where those who got retrenched left off with no handovers whatsoever and still expect to deliver their work PLUS our work.

When their IT base in Singapore was huge, it was too much competition and less promotions. However, it became better post 2011/2012 once their IT strength was reduced. \r\n2. When they had Offshore development centre (ODC) concept in Singapore, they had horrible procedures, bureaucracy and horrible leadership. Situation became 100% better once our department directly started reporting to managers in UK. Prior to 2011, some of my local managers were horrible  and manipulative, they had no clue about management and leadership. Managers in UK were much better, at least they were honest and upfront about career and opportunities guidelines. Basically no bullsh*t.\r\n3. They were pay masters 6-7 years back, now their salary does not match with current market scale.\r\n4. IT in Barclays Singapore has reduced almost 90% in past 3-4 years, if you have been offered a position after 2014 either your team is really required here or your position might be retained only for short time. They have major plans to cut down in Singapore. If you are already working there and it has been only 2-3 years, search for a better job with good compensation. Severance package is good, however, only worth waiting for people who have been there for a while.\r\n5. Promotion process is extremely horrible. You would be interviewed for the position by Senior Managers, someone who has never heard of you might have a say in your promotion depending upon how well you were in interview, it doesn't matter how well you performed in last few years. Even your line manager can't help you sometimes. However, if you have managed to influence people well, you would get promoted easily - you don't have to work hard then. Recently they announced that you could only get promotion only if they have positions otherwise you can't move ahead which is even worse. (However, if there is a position in another department vacant, you could apply for it and get promotion which is better. The catch is most of these positions were in low-cost locations and if you are in high-cost location, you don't have many options then).\r\n6.

Lots of politics, ZERO meritocracy... Earlier these problems only percolated into performance ratings and bonuses, but now with the redundancies, it decides who gets laid off and who doesn't. Lots of fantastic people are being laid off and lots of useless folks are being kept on board purely because of political reasons. Everyday, this company's total employee calibre (if there were such a thing) drops to new lows :)\r\n\r\n2. No management foresight: The decisions taken by management are very short sighted. This includes HR policies, decisions to enter/exit businesses and geographies, and even corporate real estate policies. There are numerous examples: i) spending millions of dollars to build a new system and then as soon as it is ready, realizing that it is useless and reverting to the old system. ii) Firing somebody and giving them a redundancy payment and then calling the person the very next week to offer them a job back! iii) Moving to a new office due to lack of space and then within months, firing half the people in the office iv) Setting up back office operations in a particular country over 2 years and then closing down that centre within a year... the list is endless... the management seriously have no clue what they are doing. Completely useless!\r\n\r\n3. Questionable hiring practices... You just need to look at the mix of people in some teams to realize that there is something wrong. Forget about managers hiring employees from the same country. In Barclays Singapore, you see a focus on hiring people from the same state or province! A manager from Maharashtra (a state in India) would have a team filled with employees from Maharashtra, for example. It's weird that the HR does not notice or do something about this.\r\n\r\n4. Policies that punish employee loyalty: It is much easier for a manager to hire a new VP from outside than to promote a current Barclays employee in his own team even if the Barclays employee has far more experience and is far more capable for the role. I know a case where a manager advised his own team member to quit the job and reapply to Barclays to get a better position!\r\n\r\n5. No organizational stability: I know it is important for an organization to be nimble, but the way the org structure changes in Barclays is crazy... it's like an amoeba! One of my friends was technically moved across 4 different teams during the course of one year, all while doing the exact same job throughout (even his desk did not change!)\r\n\r\n6. Increments and bonuses are pathetic. They will lure you with a decent starting base salary, but that's almost all you're ever gonna get :) \r\n\r\nI could go on... but you get the picture."}, {"review_title": "Company review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Oct 2016", "job_title": "AVP-Analyst in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay\r\nGood working environment\r\nGood work life balance\r\nInternational mobility\r\nGood mixture of races and nationalities in most business locations", "cons": "Ever changing hire/fire policy\r\nBad management with most not caring out one's career growth\r\nNeed way too many contacts to move to business location from global service centers"}, {"review_title": "Overall good company; personal connections matter", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Vice President in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Pro-people oriented in focused locations e.g. London, NY\r\n- Adopting digital and disrupting innovations actively\r\n- Work-Life Balance is good", "cons": "- Personal connections are often given priority over talent and capability\r\n- Too much strategy changes; too many flip-flops\r\n- Hierarchical management, sometimes opaque"}, {"review_title": "Comfortable employer but no growth in Singapore", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 May 2017", "job_title": "Senior Software Developer in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, insurance, very good management culture, supportive for work-life balance, following agile methodologies, technology is better than in other banks.", "cons": "All growth and opportunities are concentrated in London.

They don't pay for preventive care.  They don't pay for specialists.  They don't pay for prescriptions.  They don't pay for doctor visits even when you're sick with a serious illness (they don't even want to pay for the doctor who diagnosed and treated my wife's autoimmune disease.
