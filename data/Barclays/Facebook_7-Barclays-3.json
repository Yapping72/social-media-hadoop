Throughout the peak of Covid 19 the company made lots of changes which meant that it was harder for the customers in our department to get the support they needed, this lead to high amounts of abuse, racism and threats at time (one customer even joked about a doing a bomb threat if we did not give them what they needed) Barclays refused to send out letters to the brokers and solicitors to state that they have a zero tolerance policy on this behavior as it would \"have to go through to many channels\". One specific broker has been reported numerous times by different colleagues for sexist, racist and abusive behavior and Barclays apologized for their staff's behavior and did not bother to even listen to the calls that were provided to the team.\r\n- \tThe sickness process/line was changed at least 6 times in the last year meaning that if you were ill (even due to covid) the procedures were unclear and it was difficult to know who to contact. Due to the way the department was ran and the abuse we received at one point up to 40% of the department was on sick at the same time. \r\n- \t One team is a new path that Barclays is implementing so that the departments all work together more efficiently and merging numerous departments into one. The formation of this has been an utter shambles and information that the staff needed to know about their hours, pay, how the role would work. The only details that were provided was how it benefited Barclays. Staff were also rushed through training and did not receive the full support that was needed. There was a marginal pay rise for some staff members earning below a set amount (those already above this did not get any pay rise for doing two departments work) there was no backdated pay for the staff that had been doing the extra work for months. \r\n- \tThe department held a trip down to York in the middle of one of the lock-downs, which lead to numerous team members catching and spreading Covid. This was whistle blown by a colleague in the department. \r\n- \tThe former CEO sent out regular emails that seemed to be bragging about his trips around the world paid for by Barclays, this was at a time where we were told that \"one team was implemented to prevent redundancies\"\r\n- \tWith the changes to Covid 19 regulations staff were required to start returning to the office, staff were not briefed correctly. We were told we would be given 6 weeks notice in writing (letter) before we would be expected to return. No letters were ever sent and a vague email was sent instead and we were never updated about the changes. \r\n- \tIn the department I worked in, we were closed on bank holidays and the holidays were automatically entered onto the system and removed from our allowance, with the changes and mergers that took place due to \"One team\" upper management decided to change this process and did not notify the staff. This has led to people now owing holidays and having reduced holidays for 2022. \r\n- \tThrough my time at Barclays they worked with the mindset of if it ain't broke, break it. Feedback was consistently given by staff, customers and brokers about the systems and Barclays refused to update these. Instead any systems that worked smoothly (not many) they changed them completely and provided no training to staff on how to use these. System issues were consistent.\r\n- \tIn relation to systems in my role we were not provided access to the systems that our customers and brokers used, instead we were given outdated and vague screenshots that were extremely unhelpful. This led to regular difficult conversations with customers and brokers on how to use the system. This was raised numerous times and Barclays' response was \"we did have a few dummy accounts that you used to be able to use but they are now locked\", no effort was ever made to provide additional training or access to these systems. \r\n- \t Staff members would regularly breach processes that were set by Barclays, which lead to abusive calls when you would not breach the process. Whenever feedback was provided to team leaders to investigate this would just fall on deaf ears and the same staff members would consistently get away with breaking the process.\r\n\r\nMajority of the above has taken place throughout the last year and the way staff are treated is becoming worse by the day. There is a high turnover for staff and you are just a number. There are many more examples I can provide but the list would be endless.\r\nIf you are considering applying for Barclays my advice would be don't, avoid this company at all costs."}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Consultant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pays well enough and you can travel", "cons": "long hours are always expected"}, {"review_title": "Okay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Support Team Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunity to develop, exposure to other teams, prestige", "cons": "Lateral progression,  lack of support for studies and development"}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Vice President in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work culture, flexible hours, flat organisational structure", "cons": "Comparatively poorer internal IT processes than other IBs"}, {"review_title": "Good salary,bonus and work life balance", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Mar 2022", "job_title": "AVP-Java Developer in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You will have good salary , bonus and work life balance .", "cons": "Difficult to clear interview of Barclays .\r\nReferral is a bit easy"}, {"review_title": "Great learning environment", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "27 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Credit Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Exposure to variety commercial lending and commercial banking ecosystem", "cons": "workload is high, tools and applications are old and break down quite often"}, {"review_title": "Amazing", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good working environment, amazing team", "cons": "Less salary and less relocation options"}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "9 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good salary hike in appraisal", "cons": "no work life balance in some projects"}, {"review_title": "Decent Experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Analyst in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Better lifestyle than other banks for the role.
