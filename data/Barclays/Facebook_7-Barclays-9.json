This is why Barclays is struggling and will only struggle further in the future, expect this company to go under in about 5 years time.\r\n\r\nBe prepared to learn at least 3 to 5 different acronyms relating to the company's hollow values which change every year and can never be realised due to the aforementioned issues.\r\n\r\nThe company has gone from one extreme of being a cut-throat organisation that was all about numbers to the other extreme of a company that now pretends to be a humanitarian aid charity (its still all about the numbers) - no basis in reality and why it will continue to fail. Absolutely no commitment to any kind of coherent business strategy, in some areas of the business the name of the department you work for and your job title will change at least once a year if not more. The internal organisation of the company is an inefficient constantly fluctuating mess.\r\n\r\nFor any job you do at Barclays be prepared to earn at least \u00a35000-\u00a310,000 more in Lloyds, Nationwide or even in a smaller company for the same role, Barclays prefers to hire cheap. Intelligent staff don't last long and move into more reputable companies that pay their employees better, idiots stay behind and learn to hone the key skill of BS which is the only real way of getting far here.\r\n\r\nThe company expects to own you for a really low wage compared to others, if you get paid more than \u00a332,000 be prepared to lose evenings, weekends, sleep and your partner. If you get paid anything below this you will should have a good work life balance.\r\n\r\nBeing actually good at your job will only ensure that your managers keep you in your position for as long as possible which is why Barclays prefer to hire external management candidates over experienced and competent frontline staff.\r\n\r\nOnly about 15-20% of the employees in this company are fit for their roles, the rest are incompetent; there are many Project Managers with no qualifications or previous experience, Analysts with no skills in Excel and don't understand the nature of their roles and Managers who don't understand the departments they're managing and delegate every aspect of their work to frontline staff. The company is rife with parasitism.\r\n\r\nGenerally the company is less racist compared to others, any racism is only ever localised as there are a lot of individuals from ethnic minorities evenly spread throughout the business however they tend to only hire Muslim women who dress, how shall we say, 'liberally' - there aren't many headscarves about. Sexism is rampant, there are a lot of older women in senior positions but male managers will routinely act inappropriately towards younger female members of staff.\r\n\r\nThe management staff generally fall into two general categories; the first are poorly qualified individuals who have been there since before the 2008 financial crisis, have slowly risen the ranks by default and hence owe everything they have to the business, aren't likely to leave unless they get pushed out and are generally brainwashed drones of the cult of Barclays, there is a strange cultish mentality around corporate grades and how people are treated based on them. The second kind are also poorly qualified individuals who have come in from the cold and hired directly into management positions, they have no real experience except for a couple year long management positions in other companies, are good liars and have to parasitically leech off competent staff beneath them - the latter tend not to last very long and usually jump into a management position in another company after a year or so (repeating the same lies).\r\n\r\nDue to the abysmal hiring processes in the bank the wrong people are hired time and time again. Hiring is a continuous process with staff constantly leaving for better jobs or being made redundant and then the business having to be re-hire their positions again after realising their roles were vital.\r\n\r\nInternal mobility does happen but it is very slow due to the fact that the company does not put any real investment training its current staff. The company would rather hire a stranger from outside who has the role qualification they need over investing in someone trusted who possesses everything needed in a good employee sans the required qualification for a higher job.

The HR rules mean that you can\u2019t be promoted in the same role. You have to move department to get a higher grade. The side-effect of this is, of course, that there is no incentive to do well in your current role. And as you\u2019re not learning anything new you end up just doing the minimum and do the 9 to 5. You can only become more specialised sitting in your current role and therefore even less employable by another department.\r\n\r\nOffice \u2013 because of the cost-saving you don\u2019t get your own desk so your first hour every day is spent trying to get the desktop and monitors to work. You\u2019re packed in there like angry chickens.

That itself is mayhem, with the process designed for interns to just schmooze as many people as they can without really learning too much in the process (albeit its a 10 week program so only so much you can learn about trading). I ended up accepting the offer to join full time and it has been an overall average experience. The analyst to AVP program underpays you considerably. So kudos to those that take the offer and leave within 1 yr to get a higher salary elsewhere (where it is really possibly in trading). Overall the bank has no regard for juniors, which is why there is so much turnover. You will not find many from the internship program at Barclays, but they do stay in trading, which shows the bank is unable to retain talent. There is no feedback process for your boss. They have the ability to say whatever they want, without you contesting it. The main reason why I left is because I felt significantly undervalued. I was doing work and making the kind of money my AVP wasn't and he was paid double what I was. Thats just not the right way to treat people, especially a woman trader. So I would say this bank does not particularly support women in trading. I would say this to those interested: join, use the bank for as much as it can give you (1 yr pay), and leverage to do something better. DO NOT stick around. It is not worth it. I had several MDs of different desks that supported me and my work, but were unable to help me get the pay I deserved.

I have been laid off 3 times already, my manager is on his 4th position in the company, and the fear of being laid off causes people to silo information out of fear of losing their jobs. The company is based off of reactionary decisions because employees aren't around long enough to see their projects through and many of these projects are aimed at innovating the company. I have worked at other financial companies and some are direct competitors to Barclays and I am shocked that Barclays is even still in business. Their practices and management structure have put them seriously behind the competition. At this point Barclays is surviving on its name brand alone and even in that case the Barclays name is being tarnished by bad management and executive decisions."}], [{"review_title": "Big name...small visions", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Mortgages in Manchester City Centre, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Dedicated, friendly, hardworking and loyal staff.", "cons": "Staff are greatly undervalued.

Because Barclays UK employees want to avoid work - if you are doer kind of person and deliver work they feel threatened about their job. If you are a doer kind of person this place is not for you. If you are meticulously delivering value, your boss will pretend not to understand it and will underestimate you, but yes he will speak sweetly with you as if he is on your side and understands everything.  Appraisal is flawed - if a UK vendor complains against you, despite your justifications it wont be considered just because you are India and he is UK.  Boss doesnt have visibility of your work and neither wants to try for getting visibility because he is lazy - so surprise alternative !!! -> you have to to beg your colleagues to give feedback, even if you know they lack any knowledge about your work, so its not smart appraisal and quite random. Then any negative comment is picked up from their feedback and focus is only on negatives and not on any positive. They will also put you in ImprovementNeeded as you are not aligned to them politically. Most of the time of afternoons is spent in meetings.  In Barclaycard, projects are planned to be delivered within 6 months these needlessly go on and on, there is a lot of needless polished english exchange in them - then big meetings are arranged to say with polished english taglines apologizing that this project is delayed by another 3 years.

When I first started there I thought it would be a neutral culture but it isnt. If you go to the pub and your name is john your cool.  I saw a alot of  people get spoken to like dirt. In the BPF department there were alot of cliques and alot of chavs. I saw a guy get racially abused on a number of occasions.  Diversity in the Northampton site is a word only. Team leaders are a clique. If you want to be in a clique then go to Barclays Northampton, also you are going to have to share your personal social media accounts to be in a clique.  The management are two faced and very rude. Directors have sexual relations with female staff members even when they are married.  It is like a equivalent of a  pedophile ring. They then talk about Honesty, Stewardship, and integrity on a regular basis.  I also saw a guy ask another worker for a fight. That guy was a team leader. There is always talk of diversity but it is just a word. Picture all the fat and insecure people at school, they are the type of people that work in Barlcays Partner Finance. Also HR takes the side of managers over staff. Their employment policy is not in line with the ACAS code of conduct. Unite the union sides with the Bank.  My advice dont talk to anyone there unless you can trust them.  The directors at this site are equally rude. They are paid \u00a360000 a year but they dont know anything about underwriting.  There is rule for the directors and one for the workers.  Most of the team leaders in the Northampton  Site  are Far Right Sympathizers, they think England should be white and only white.
