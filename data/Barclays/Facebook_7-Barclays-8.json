Unless you're one of a lucky few, don't start thinking of mansions, fast cars and so on - it's media hype. Those days are gone for most. Numeration day is a total joke (almost insulting) so unless you're pulling in hundreds of millions for your boss (unlikely) don't think you're on the ticket to success when you get here. Learn lots, work hard and see what happens - but it's not Leonardo DiCaprio wolf of wall street ticket to success stuff. You missed the boat big time on that one.\r\n\r\nCrazy working hours. Yes, you get paid well however when you work it out per hour it becomes very average. If you're contract says 9-5 don't honestly expect to work those. I work 8:30am til 6:30pm (middle office) - a lot of my team work longer and we aren't compensated like successful traders / sales people (most old school are long gone).\r\n\r\nIt's the same everywhere I've been, especially in banks - politics. It's a huge company and people are looking after themselves - it doesn't mean you're going to have a terrible time but managers are so busy looking up pandering to the needs of those above and playing politics with others that what chance to those at the bottom get? Real leadership inspires, nurtures, listens, etc - but most in leadership roles (big and small) are not natural leaders.\r\n\r\nWith the greatest respect to those in India; stop offshoring Barclays. Seriously, I know you can get 3 Indians or more for the price of 1 in the UK or US but it's about value and not price for what you get. Let's not confuse value and price. Half the company is based out in India by workers utterly confused and inexperienced, not able to think beyond their checklists printed for them. Empty promises, not delivering work, when it is delivered it's all wrong or fudged - ah, I can go on. Seriously, it's easier to get up and work with one person on the other side of the floor.\r\n\r\nSome teams can be a bit 'old boys network' but they are rare. It could be much worse - most are normal.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue at Barclays investment right now (early 2015) is that it is run by a chap that knows retail banking (CEO Anthony Jenkins). The investment bank is a mere child compared to what it was a few years ago and staff morale is low. It's low because people are heavily overworked due to ruthless job slashing yet the business keeps demanding more and more - there is no more juice to squeeze. I get the feeling the top guys want to turn the overall Barclays group into a retail bank and sell of the investment part eventually - so long as it's providing a good enough return then they'll keep hold. But seriously, the workforce are drained, exhausted and good people leave within just a year.\r\n\r\nThe bank has tens of thousands of staff. Even those extremely good at the bottom deserving promotion have odds heavily stacked against them because of the numbers game. It's very hard to get noticed when you have so many also wanting to be noticed and seen as 'special'. Don't expect quick promotions, like with most banks (a lot of good timing and luck involved) rather than natural talent and skill."}], [{"review_title": "CIB AVP", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Assistant Vice President CIB in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Good work life balance\r\n- business is understanding of commitments outside of work, thus allows flexibility to work from home or flex working hours.\r\n- office culture is relaxed and no hard pressure over work and deadlines.\r\n- nice team members, that are talented and a pleasure to work with.", "cons": "- Many inefficient operations, difficult to bring change or add value\r\n- Slow strategic decision making, resulting in frustration amongst team.\r\n- Not very well connected between wider business areas, therefore oversight of significant changes impacting remit of work within respective department \r\n- No opportunity for career progression"}, {"review_title": "Collector III", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent bonuses, great benefits (blue cross blue shield), A lot of vacation and personal time.

The online training does not prepare you for the job as much as it should and there should be longer practical training to enable best customer service.\r\n- As a temp, there were no benefits including no sick pay or holiday pay.\r\n- Management often place lots of pressure on the front of house staff off the back of MPS customer service calls. We are often told conflicting ideas to approach customer service i.e. We must man Zone A (meet&greet zone) then told after customers say we aren't helping enough to not man Zone A. Told to encourage customers to use Assisted Service Counters, but often getting feedback that as customer service providers we are too pushy/intrusive. The zonal system does not work and needs to be reworked by people who have actually been party to the first line of defence within customer service as they have the best idea of day to day service and know how there banking hall works best.\r\n- MPS system for customer feedback is poor as the questions are open ended and long which results in discrepancies between MPS calls due to differential customer opinion on good customer service. Essential bankers often facing the brunt of this and not getting their good work recognised.\r\n- Management are not pro-active enough and do not show banking hall presence - often showing a begrudging attitude to being asked to cover the banking hall-  therefore it is often condescending to staff to be told how to improve their service as management do not know the day to day running of the banking hall and thus can not devise plans. \r\n- All staff should be trained on all aspects of the business before progressing as often it leaves the banking hall short as people can not cover the counter and therefore leaves people alone in the banking hall - which is not only dangerous in case of emergency but also reflects poorly on customer service.\r\n- Some staff are on old contracts which is unfair to other members of staff. Staff often got to leave early or not work saturdays because of their old contract - this should be updated to ensure there are enough staff provisions for the whole day - not only part of the day as it forces pressure on the staff who complete the whole day. \r\n- Management encourage competition between staff which creates an uneasy atmosphere. Praise is often not given on merit - as managers often have their favourites (which is not unique to barclays but should nevertheless be worked upon to ensure all staff feel satisfaction within their job.) Cohesiveness of the team would also improve alongside a healthier working environment if this was fixed and looked at.\r\n- Technology at Barclays is among the best within the banking sector, however often it fails which is not only embarrassing but also reflects poorly on customer service. Barclays should enable all technology is piloted and works well before rolling it out in to all their branches. For example the Kiosk and its software& privacy must be looked at and improved upon to improve customer service. Counter software should be updated and easier to use. iPad's should be able to action prompts and the software should be improved to ensure it doesn't time out constantly which results in poor customer service as often staff take customers out of the counter queue to help them but due to technological error have to place the customer back in to the queue.\r\n-Marketing also needs to be improved upon. Often posters are released with poor wording regarding branch closure or hour reduction which results in unhappy customers. Again, essential bankers face the brunt of this. Marketing should ask essential bankers their opinions or create a poll in some instances - or even take someone on who has had front line experience because the company would benefit from correct wording and knowledge of someone who has dealt with customers on a day to day business."}, {"review_title": "Great at first and then just a down hill of bad", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Consumer Lending Specialist in Hamilton, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pays well for the work, Mangers care about you (Can't say anything about the higher ups above them tho.)", "cons": "Hours (Change hours on people and then wonder why everyone quits if you haven't fired them and beg for overtime to the reminder of the staff.)

At the same time, there are several high profile senior MD\u2019s and global heads who were let go, when they failed to continue to deliver.\r\n\r\nIt certainly is hard work, but having been there for nearly three years, I have never come across anybody saying it is a sweatshop.  You have freedom to manage your work.  The culture is fairly relaxed; and there is great drive and support to recruit, retain and develop talent (something Diamond never fails to reiterate in his quarterly updates); and promote charitable activities.  Women\u2019s networks are very active, and there are several female MD\u2019s; however, their ratio is far from being 1:1.  Staff benefits such as pensions and health insurance are reasonably generous (from my UK experience), and I doubt are available at similar levels at some of the American banks.", "cons": "The downsides really depend on the team or business unit you are in.  Overall, there is probably a net upside, given my comments earlier.  However, what I have found is that, in some cases, Diamond has not been so successful in passing down his inspiration and enthusiasm through the leadership ladder.  Generally, front office is devoid of this issue, as I guess it benefits most from his oversight.  However, there are certain pockets in the middle office (where I work), where culture and perspectives are still not quite 21st century; where internal politics and cronyism is a bit too obvious.  Consequently, meritocracy and fair treatment have tended to suffer.  There are highly talented senior managers (in their area of expertise), but with hardly any interpersonal skills and knowledge of people & relationship management.  Their lack of the softer skills have sometimes tended to impact the team fabric.  Occasionally, there are individuals, whose lack of knowledge is far exceeded by the positions and rewards they enjoy.  \r\n\r\nIf you are unlucky enough to work in such teams, especially in times of a very dry market such as the current ones, where there are not many other jobs on offer, this can have a huge impact on morale."}, {"review_title": "The best work relationships I've enjoyed, offset by immature managers with trust issues who fail to develop talent.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Jan 2009", "job_title": "Senior Project Manager in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I've been with the company for a while primarily because of the bonus pay.

If you have a personality, I would advise you to stay away from certain BU's in Barclays. Also, too much competition between managers to be best. My manager would frequently talk smack about the other team manager yet be all nice to their face, and also tell them things that you have spoken to them about in confidence. At times it was laughable and was noted between the entire team as being wrong (even those people who were 'pets'). Salary is OK, but bonus time they literally move the goal posts to match whatever they want. They need to stick to their objectives and if you deliver, you deserve a reward.

When I began they put me in new to bank training even though I had been a part of Barclays for 5 years already, it had been a while since my last management position and some management training would have been a lot more beneficial. They also gave me a team that they had taken on as a risk due to the majority of them coming into work from long term unemployment and as such a lot of them were difficult to manage! The job role they were doing was not any kind of relationship building or management. They were on an outbound dialler making sales calls, all the calls were loaded into the dialler based on prompts about lending, mortgages and sometimes savings (although the focused heavily on lending mainly). The people I was managing had no idea what they were targeted against Yet I was expected to put action plans in place when they didn\u2019t get things like mortgages or loans within a 2 week period. In the end I had to take time off and decided this wasn\u2019t the job for me. When I returned I was made a direct premier relationship manager where i would contact the customers to build relationships myself, while this was using the same outbound dialler there was more of a relationship building style to it and not just completely sales. However, on returning I was clear my card was marked and I wasn\u2019t wanted there, I would imagine it was due to having knowledge of the underhand techniques and sales they were driving when as a bank Barclays do not set targets for sales. I soon found myself going through a disciplinary process and when speaking to other people within the department and the union the \u201coffence\u201d I had committed should have been dealt with by no more than a file note. Soon after this was resolved I found myself to be the main suspect of another investigation for a laptop which was stolen 12 months earlier from my car, at the time this was reported to the police and they had seen the damage done to my car from the break in. I was told it was someone within the department who had contacted their special investigations team to raise this with them requesting it was looked into. This I also believe to have been done maliciously and in an attempt to make me feel like i was no longer welcome there, I\u2019ve since decided to leave Barclays as they made it difficult for me to move to another business area."}, {"review_title": "Barclays Corporate Banking", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Jan 2010", "job_title": "Customer Care Agent in Slough, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Barclays pays its staff well and you do get some good worthwhile product discounts", "cons": "Things change on almost a weekly basis with no thought as to how these will play out from the customer's or staff's point of view.
