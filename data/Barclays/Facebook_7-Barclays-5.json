You are able to adjust your working hours or/and work from home, as long as you manage to manage your workload. Just great service.\r\n- Barclays is a huge organization with millions of customers. Any project that you are involved might result in millions of additional revenue or reduced costs, which is always nice both for personal satisfaction but also to include in your CV.\r\n- Barclays supports heavily volunteering. There is a pound-for-pound match for any donations made by employees to most global non-profit organizations and initiatives and you are able to participate in Barclays' Lifeskills program, which is a great program with mane opportunities to get involved in volunteering around your area.\r\n- The benefits package is quite generous. The pension scheme must be one of the best in the UK market, private healthcare, annual bonus, buying stocks at preferential rates, income protection, etc.\r\n- Redundancy rounds. Barclays during the past couple years was under an enormous restructuring. So lots of people was offered to leave the bank and get significant redundancy packages. If you want to change a job anyway, then this might be a nice way to get a great bonus on your way out.", "cons": "- Lots of politics\r\n- Lots of scrutiny, bureaucracy (I guess like everywhere in financial services)\r\n- Limited resources - You will never be able to hire the number of people that you need. It is very rare to have them pay for any professional certification/training. When I joined in the first 2 weeks I didn't have a laptop, and then they gave me an old/used one from someone who left! It wasn't even cleaned properly and it was disgusting. I finally got a new laptop after 12 months!\r\n- As mentioned it's a great company to work and has great benefits. So you will meet many people who are working in Barclays for more than 10-15 years (and some even stay for their whole career!). This means that eventually, you might have a manager who joined Barclays right after school and managed to get promoted after so many years. Hence, you should expect that you might have to work along people who are not the brightest or/and have limited skills when compared with other companies at that level.\r\n- Redundancy rounds. I mentioned earlier this as a pro. But it's a con as well, especially for people who were close to retiring and it's almost impossible for them to find another job at an advanced age. Also, quite tricky to become redundant during a pandemic (COVID-19)."}, {"review_title": "Stagnated environment and too much management politics", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 May 2021", "job_title": "Project Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You could start your career here ( depending on department/ team)", "cons": "Long hours , too much politics and little or no room for collaboration"}, {"review_title": "so kewl", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 May 2021", "job_title": "Personal Banker in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "they\u2019re calm tbh i like them", "cons": "like honestly what would i say i don\u2019t want to lose my job???"}, {"review_title": "Historic tech, good pay.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 May 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Glasgow, Scotland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary, benefits, not much else.", "cons": "Long hours working with US based division.\r\nTechnology is incredibly outdated.
