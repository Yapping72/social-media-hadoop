I wasn't part of the club. I got hired normally base on skills I guess. Even the front desk woman was shock when I told her I got hire normally like a normal person no friends or getting on my knees. \r\n\r\nBaker Hughes PA has a little click. You either a friend of their little groups or you came from the same university. If you come from West Virginia University then you'll have an easier time moving up because most of the clowns in the office came from that university. If you want to laugh they label as the WV mafia pretty funny huh ? \r\n\r\nThe next thing you need to know is this, if you have no life and just came out of school and don't respect yourself then you'll be the right guy or woman for the job. They don't respect time off unless you challenge them. They try to strong arm you a lot,  the employees are scared to speak up because in PA they have laws that they can fire you for whatever reason. Also because most assume they're \"friends\" with the office people.  You'll work none stop unless either something serious happens in your personal life or if you're their friend. A lot of their spineless employees will cry how they haven't been home and give these ridiculous reason why they don't want to go home.\r\n\r\nThey will jump over hoops for their friends but if you're not in the group then you're dead in the water. Expect nothing , they also had pay cuts don't be fooled by what they told you, they're goal right now is to save money and they're just targeting FE and FS because they have this idea that the field hands are the problem for the cost issues. Instead of looking within their little office and start saving money from within. \r\n\r\nSome times there is no support and you'll have to manage things your self. You'll work sometimes with co-workers who are great who understand the job and there are times you'll work with some guys who are just worthless. You'll end up doing everything yourself and believe me they will get the credit and you won't instead you'll look like the bad guy, these guys will call the office and tell them made up garbage just to sound good. I bet you're asking what do they get from this ? They get nothing all they're told is \"good job man....\" that's it.  A lot of these big egos normally cost the job as well. Even the clients have complains of the coordinators for lying and other things. How are you suppose to cover for their lies? but I'm the bad guy ? \r\n\r\nPromotions and fast tracking goes to their friends first, then the rest if they have room (money funds). Lots of cry babies that will use false issues to excel. \r\n\r\nIf you're a smart person who is following the oil and gas industry then look some where else. Other districts are better then the PA one. I'm shock that no one has wrote about this ? A lot of the reviews also appear to be fake on here so let see how fast this one gets black holed . \r\n\r\nThe worse thing about it is if you do want to be an awesome employee and you want to excel within the company then it's not going to happen. You can design or built something and it will be shot down because someone got jealous or cried about it or some weird mess.  Again like I said I don't requirement this company it was bad when I got in and it just got worse over time.

Performance evaluation / people management: usually managers do not consider as part of their goals the development of their team, the formal performance evaluation process has been replaced by \"feedback based tool\" with no performance rating indicator. Basically making impossible to compare 2 people performances on objective basis. It means that career is mostly driven by your network, your boss network with no real connection with meritocracy and achievements, site by site the situation can vary in accordance to the local culture: the presence of \"hidden internal lobbies\" that promote their friends as well as sponsor each others' achievements of internal metrics is not unusual    \r\n5.
