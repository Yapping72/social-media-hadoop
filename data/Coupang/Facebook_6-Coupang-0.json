I am writing to prevent someone making mistake I made.\n\n- Work/life balance is terrible. If you work at Coupang, you must work Seoul hours. The recruiter or hiring manager might lie to you and say \"we are heading in direction of building leadership in the US and being autonomous\" but that is a lie. All decisions, strategy, everything happens on Seoul time and you will need to spend your evenings and late nights working. It is exhausting.\n\n- The stock price is 50% down from IPO, it is the biggest loser of the \"covid era\". I am not aware of any unicorn+ tech which lost more. For reference, WeWork is down 18% in same time. And it's not clear when the bottom comes. There are still some good fundamentals about Coupang's business and there is a positive argument to be made for recovery, but that's a long way And there are tons of insiders waiting to sell out if recovery happens (You can see them all saying this if you check Blind). Even if the stock does recover some day (and I honestly think it will be ok eventually), I don't think you can believe it's better than tech industry average at this point. There's definitely no reason to justify the work/life balance and other issues.\n\n- Many of the pre-IPO fully vested folks just bailed. Entire leadership groups disappeared. There is a leadership crisis happening. Many more pre-IPO folks are resting and vesting and mostly interested in hiding from risky politics. Many ppl's top priority is not drawing attention to themselves.\n\n- All decisions are made by a small group of people in Seoul. They don't say \"here is a problem, go understand it and figure out the best solution\", instead they say \"Do exactly X, because we already decided it's the right solution\". You are not involved in deciding X, and btw if X doesn't work that is your fault, not theirs. If they get bored or move on to the next problem, they just stop showing up to meetings or responding to emails. This is not a bottom up Silicon Valley company, it's extremely Top Down, you're just low level pawn.. Most of my time has been working on pointless strategies decided by ppl in Seoul.\n\nI don't feel any upside to my work, and I don't feel I can work on any real problems, just politics.
