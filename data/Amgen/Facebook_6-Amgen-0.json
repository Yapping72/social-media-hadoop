I found the Finance and Accounting groups struggled with higher turnover than other groups. Many of the processes are repetitive and unnecessary and you are not empowered. There is more focus on tradition and deference vs. knowledge and ability. The turnover in the last year was insane. Many of the best and most knowledgeable people are gone. The result is that people who aren't qualified for promotions are getting them, but would not have, had others stuck around. Lower-level management can be terrible. Due to the turnover, you have people put into people leadership positions when they don't have the desire or expertise to be in such a role. The result is unprofessional management who plays favorites and does their best to undermine and give no support if they have it out for you, yet they expect you to support them and set their favorites (and themselves) up for success. I've seen instances of managers in a role for less than a year, who basically turned their entire team over, and management didn't bat an eye. It should have been obvious the manager and their lack of support was the problem. In one instance, a manager lost every single knowledgeable, experienced person on the team, yet is still in the role. This individual covered up their lack of knowledge by blaming the people that left, vs. taking accountability for not ever bothering to learn what the team does or having a continuity plan. You also spend quite a bit of time in meetings...not team meetings or department meetings, but with others constantly booking one on one meetings because they don't know the systems or their roles, and expect others to hold endless calls to teach them how to do what their manager should be instructing them on. Amgen has a desire to be competitive and serve patients, but I don't see the company being a strong player in the future if they don't focus more on empowering their people, ensuring people leaders are knowledgeable and engaged with their team and ensuring that everyone is treated with respect."}, {"review_title": "Great workplace", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Data Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great management Competitive compensation and benefits Opportunities for growth", "cons": "No major cons to report Lean organization may have fewer opportunities for upward growth, but many lateral moce opportunities"}, {"review_title": "Salary", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Associate Manufacturing", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Paid 22.5hrs overtime as due to breakdown payment even though you work 86hrs bi-weekly, stocks, gift card (Bravo!) and Bunus for performance,", "cons": "Stocks is vested 30% after 3 years received"}, {"review_title": "Meh", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "1 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Senior Manager, Standards  in Thousand Oaks, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Thousand Oaks is pretty and the ocean is nearby.", "cons": "If you do really good work, you get punished by then getting to do your co-workers work too."}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for.", "cons": "Everything is good but the base price is low compared with competitors."}, {"review_title": "Excellent Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Equipment Engineer in West Greenwich, RI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amgen is an excellent company to work for.

Keep in mind that this was early 2020 and no vaccine was available. In fact, company policy said that those who had already caught the virus were \"immune, and didn't need to socially distance anymore.\" We even got hazard pay for coming in and I was really happy during this time.\n\nThen, as the pandemic years got stretched out, I grew very angry and disillusioned with the company. First there was the woke training everyone had to go through after the 2020 protests. The training explicitly said, no matter how un-racist you think you are, you will always be inherently racist. The training itself was very racist, consisting of us having to match good or bad \"traits\" up with people of different colors. This is the type of stuff that I could be fired for if I wrote it, based on employee guidelines, yet they were training us to follow this indoctrination garbage.\n\nNext, the company used the pandemic to deny us of every amenity on campus. No gym for years (even after outside gyms were open). If I stay late and go run on the soccer field or shoot hoops by myself, around 9 pm, a security guard comes over and tells me to get off. \n\nThe final straw was that the company mandated that I receive a vacks-seen or be fired. (I can't type the word because my review will be censored). Despite the fact the vacks-seen does not protect infection or transmission, I was told I was not being \"science based\" if I did not receive one like everyone else. Even though common sense says it was perfectly safe for me to work there when vacks-seens weren't available, and that previous company policy said it was perfectly safe for me to work there when I had already gotten antibodies, it was suddenly not safe enough for me to work there. And they even made people who were 100% remote, never stepping foot onsite, to get a vacks-seen--that shows you how science based this company has become."}, {"review_title": "Great culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "4 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Marketing Director in Thousand Oaks, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Culture Good work life balance I feel valued Remote working option", "cons": "Ability to grow depends on network"}, {"review_title": "Great Atmosphere", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Nov 2022", "job_title": "HR Business Specialist in Tampa, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very organized The employees are helpful and professional", "cons": "I did not like the modern office design.

This company is led by its lawyers and Microsoft Excel.  2) Upper management that's generally out of touch with what's happening on the ground.  3) Management that prefers to punch and delegate down than take responsibility.  4) Some upper management with toxic attitudes who, despite complaints, are never disciplined. However, don't you dare be anything but perfectly professional if you're not an ED or higher.  5) Leadership that says one thing and does another. For example, the top-down push for \"aggressive prioritization\" is juxtaposed by assignment of MORE low priority work and MORE metrics/processes.  6) Development that moves along at a snail's pace despite everyone being overworked due to metrics/processes.  7) A Stalinist corporate environment where people are afraid to speak up.  8) (Department-specific) Lack of appreciation for the people doing the real work on the front lines.  9) (Department-specific) Poor overall compensation by industry standards.  10) An inordinate amount of time updating timelines and budgets for management review.  11) Poor work-life balance; you will be hard-pressed to use your vacation time due to the sheer amount of work and fire drills. Everyone is assigned to multiple programs but expected to be 100% on all of them, another indication that the drive for prioritization is nothing more than empty rhetoric.  12) A deluge of FAKE reviews on Glassdoor via third-party astroturfers to combat downward trajectory in rating. These end up burying the legitimate reviews. Not out of the ordinary, but Amgen is one of the few companies that has hired a PR company to combat negative perceptions on Glassdoor.
