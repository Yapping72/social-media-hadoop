I am an Arizona native, so I am familiar with the whole state, and unfortunately, Tucson stinks.  It is run down, dirty, trashy, and just depressing.  Don't be fooled by the one or two areas that are nice, which are far from the RMS site, because it is both too far and too expensive, and you still have the rest of Tucson around you.\r\n-  Now, for RMS...they are terrible about trading or teaching new hires about how things are done there.  Many I have spoken to have admitted that this is an issue.  They throw you into a program and the company without any guidance and you are expected to just figure it out.  No support.  Many of the people there have NEVER worked anywhere else (many started there before Raytheon bought Hughes) and they have no ability to imagine that there are better, more effective ways to do things.\r\n-  Next, they are hiring so fast that they do not have room for people.  I had a \"lilypad\" assigned to me (not a desk, but a corner near a conference room where a person would normally sit to wait for the conference room to clear out before your meeting).  This would not be a big deal if it was ANYWHERE near my coworkers or program.  I had a lily pad (remember, not a desk) assigned in a different building across the campus from where I was to work with others.  This is not something that a few people experience; it is the norm.  Almost all new employees will not have a place to work.  It took me a full year to get a desk assigned to me in the same building as my colleagues, but not near them, as they were all clustered together but I was off across the building...but at least I was in the same building with a desk assignment.\r\n-  Affirmative Action is strong with this one.  You would expect that at any government contractor, but they are actively looking for ways to promote everyone oth re than white men to leadership positions.  They had a meeting in each group to discuss what RMS can do to get more women and People of Color (POC) to apply to and to be given jobs over men and non-POC, defined as non-white.  So a Vietnamese person is the same as a Cuban is the same as an African descendant...as long as you are female &/or non-white they are actively looking to move you up.  That may be great for you.  If you are female or a POC, take advantage of it.  It isn't your fault that the door is opened, so go for it.  But if this kind of thing bothers you as a principle, then know that it is there.  Here is a perfect example of this for you.  In my 10 years of being an engineer, I have learned that being a Chief Engineer is a big deal.  You have to know your stuff, have lots of experience, and be an expert in your field.  Chiefs are often synonymous with being a Fellow.  These are technical gurus.  I like learning from these Engineers.  At RMS, there was a Chief Engineer that I worked directly with that was very young.  This Chief was a female POC, and I assumed that she was a super-engineer because she was only about 32.  Usually, Chiefs/Fellows have 25-30 years of engineering experience, so meeting someone so young made me think she must be a prodigy.  Another engineer started recently that has 10 years experience like myself, and he remembered graduating with her.  We were both impressed, until we started working with her.  She wasn't any better or worse than anyone else with 10 years experience.  Later, we found out the whole story.  RMS wants to promote certain individuals over others, so while her pay-grade was th e same as ours, she had the ceremonial title of Chief Engineer with all of the unilateral decision making abilities Chiefs have.  She did not have the experience equal to that of a Chief at most any oth we company, and it showed.\r\n-  PTO stinks because you have no guaranteed vacation time.  If you get sick, it comes out of the same bucket as your vacation.\r\n- The general climate of the people I worked with is that work and career is paramount while personal or family life is secondary.\r\n- Even when the Program Management for the program I worked asked for volunteers to telecommute to free up desk space, not just my \"functional\" management say no, but almost everyone I knew were told no, no matter what department they worked for.  I understand that many of the other Raytheon companies are encouraging telecommuting, but for some reason, RMS is not wanting to accept that paradigm shift.\r\n- There are many other cons, but I have already written a book here."}, {"review_title": "A Great Company to Work for in the Year 1978", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Electrical Engineer in Andover, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You are going to be surrounded by some of the smartest engineers on the planet, tackling some of the most challenging problems.

DCMA needs to take a much closer look at a lot of the programs, because there is a lot of questionable practices going on that is sacrificing product reliability and quality.  Stuff getting swept under the rug, practices mostly that put the long-term viability of the product line at risk. At the same time, management has no interest in promoting within the company - but keeps complaining about retention and recruitment. I had an informal meeting with one of the directors who flat out told me - with two years already at the company, and four years of total experience - that I was still \"two to four years\" away from being promoted to engineer II, because \"we don't promote for its own sake\". This was not someone I reported to, just someone who I knew would give me a straight[er] answer. Raytheon just doesn't promote, full stop. In my two years there, I haven't seen a single internal promotion happen around me - including engineers who had been in their roles, excelling, for three to five years before I even got there. You have to at least leave your role, and usually leave the company, in order to get a promotion - and they don't give real raises without promotions. If your yearly raise matches inflation, you're doing extremely well compared to your peers. The raise never beats inflation. The work/life balance is also terrible. Some people are lucky, and their program will qualify for overtime - even as a salaried employee - but most are not, and everyone, except the managers, is working 60-80hr weeks. The 9/80 schedule is great, if your program actually lets you take advantage of it. The pay is also low for the titles as well to, just to add insult to injury, looking at the official pay ranges and curves for the various titles.\r\n\r\nListening to the 'old-timers', people who have been in their same roles since the 80s, 70s, or even 60s, things used to be much better. The health insurance was fully-paid; promotions and raises were the norm, not the exception; the retirement plans were golden; the work/life balance was excellent most days.\r\n\r\nMy advise, if you apply and get offered a job at Raytheon, take it, work for two to three years, then move on. Especially if you are still early in your career. There is no benefit to you staying longer than that, but it is enough time for you to really polish your skills and establish yourself as an engineer who knows which way is up."}, {"review_title": "DO NOT get onto the Buckley Teams", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Feb 2019", "job_title": "Senior Information Systems Technologist I in Aurora, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.

Lots of bureaucracy.  You'll know whether you're on the fast track within 3 or 4 years.  But as an engineer it offers interesting work and being a big company there is opportunity to move around.

This is probably happening at many companies.  Flexible work schedule.  The extent of the flexibility varies depending upon your manager and your work in particular.  In my experience it is easy to flex a handful of hours here and there, and no one bothers you if you make them up within a 2 week window.  Also they allow the option of a \"9/80 work schedule\" which means you work 9 hour days and get every other friday off.  After 5 years you get 4 weeks of vacation/sicktime (all one bucket).  After 15 years you get 5 weeks which is the max.  Some people are grandfathered in with more time off, but they are the older folks.  They offered a pension up until about 2005.  I know it's not useful for new employees but I figured I'd mention it (the pension is calculated as 1.8%/year for the first 20 years and then 1.2%/year every year thereafter.  That final percentage of your salary when you retire is the benefit).  For 401k, they match up to 4% of your salary.", "cons": "Hard to get promotions.  In engineering they have 6 levels, and then two engineering fellow salary grades.  So I will admit there aren't a ton of rungs here.  However, even if you perform well, they are very stingy with the promotions.  They only like to see certain %(low) of people move up in a given timeframe.  The first 3 or 4 grades will go fast.  Then it slows down.  There are also management tracks which become less technical the higher up you go.  More like managing people and department resources.  Then there are tracks for Program management.   In my experience, the frustrating thing to see on your review is that you're \"promotable\" and then not actually get the promotion.  The designation seems to hold little meaning.  They are also a fan of carrot dangling.  The \"do this additional thing\" or \"wait til next cycle\" is a common response.  I'm not a huge fan of the review process in general.  There is a large disconnect between the people who decide the rankings / raises / promotions and the project management.  Also the performance review timeline is crazy.  You tell line management who your technical leads have been and divide up the time you spent working on the tasks with those leads.  Usually you report this in November.  Typically this is 2-4 people.  Then the line management asks those people for a review of your work.  Typically a paragraph or so.  Then the requesting folks who haven't spent more than 10 hours with you all year are sitting in a room ranking the people in that dept within each level (ranked against your peers).  These rankings determine raises and promotions.  If you are top 10% you will probably get 1-3% over someone in the middle and you may get a promotion.  In my experience the typical raise is 3-4% and a promotion is typically worth another 3-4%.  To get back to the time line, I have been told the ranking are determined by the end of the year.  Sometimes before a required final self assessment and report on your year.  They ask for this but it appears it is more for documentation and has little, if any influence on rankings b/c they have already been done.  Then sometime in January the raise budget is decided per department and the dept manager and the 5 or 6 section managers below him must divide up the budget guided by the rankings.  Then in April you get your previous year performance review from your section manager with a summary which is often recycled stuff you or your technical manager wrote.  It'll say M = meets expectations, E = exceeds expectations or FE = far exceeds expectations.  It may also have a designation P for promotable.  Here is the stupifying thing.  At that moment you can have a great review with tons of positive feedback.  Then about 3 weeks later at the beginning of May you get a raise notice (effective the first paycheck in May) which tells you the bottom line % increase all this BS has been leading up to.  At this point it's too late to do anything.  Management is very inflexible on disputes and making any \"corrections\". Then about a month later you have your mid year review for the current year and the horrible cycle continues.  Why must this be so drawn out?  And why do people who have no clue what is being done on a daily basis wield so much power over something as important as this?  By the time you actually get feedback on the previous year, we are a solid 4 months into the new year.  That is so dumb.  I have no idea why the review cycle must be so extended.  Plus if you want to dispute something, or make a case for yourself, time has passed, no one remembers details, and management claims there is nothing they can do.

Even with a good rating you may get passed on a raise for the year because your salary is too high compared to your peers despite having good performance. \r\n- Promotions come very slowly - people get passed on promotions even having consecutive \"exceed expections\" ratings multiple years in a row because of a lack of salary penetration in pay grade. \r\n- Lack of work/life balance and risk adverse. Managers refuse to make decisions because they don't want to be blamed for the consequences of the decision (which by the way there are consequences to every decision, there is no \"perfect\" decision), then they only take action a month before contract deadlines when a decision must be made, so then they force everyone to work OT to catch up and execute on the decision that should have been made months ago. \r\n- Good ol' boy system. It doesn't matter what you know, but who you know in order to get best assignments and opportunities. \r\n- Knowledge silos and general lack of communication and sharing. This creates a culture of people not listening to each other and reinventing the wheel even if the information is not classified or proprietary. \r\n- Lot of deadwood and leachers just pulling a paycheck\r\n- At orientation, they tell you to do an R6Sigma project within first year; then front line management gives no direction to new employees on project ideas. If the project is not completed in 8 months, management will antagonize you and act like it's all your fault. It will be held against you if you don't complete your project in the first 8 months, even if you complete it later down the line. \r\n- Vacation and Sick time lumped into PTO and not very generous \r\n- Health Benefits declining; No more PPO; all HDHP. Premiums rising every year. Plus there's a lot of fine print to the health and dental plans that limit coverage on most commonplace treatments. \r\n- 401K match is average (3%) but you need to stay over 10 years to get a high matching contribution. It's based on your age at the time you hired in (or rehired) so they screw over the young people and there's no incentive for them to stay in the long run. \r\n- Horrible travel policy. Almost impossible to fly business class internationally even for long flights and all meals must be charged to corporate card; per diem is not advanced to travelers. \r\n- Most front line managers & section heads lack basic managerial skills.

There's almost always a free lunch in some conference room (leftovers from noon time meetings). Lots of programs so lots of different stuff to work on (except now). Beautiful landscaped main facility, clean. The restrooms and grounds are in really good shape for example. Most people at Raytheon work a 9/80 work schedule.", "cons": "I don't want to write this as a dislike, more of a slightly disturbing observation. Like the Doors song \"People are Strange\", There is some sort of weird culture at Raytheon El Segundo in that people avoid eye contact in the hall ways. Everyone seems to be in a guarded insular stance. You rarely hear people laughing. I don't know if it is Raytheon, or Southern California, or commuting, or the 2011 economy but most Raytheon employees are not cheerful, they're almost morose or depressed. Nobody ever talks about their home life. You never hear of after work or weekend outings. People really keep to themselves. We realize the work we do is important and a lot of it is extremely classified but the mood is way too serious in casual interaction. I don't get it.\r\nBenefits: Starting in 2010 Raytheon 401(k) only provides a 3% company match (4% after 5 years). Boeing for example provides 6% and Northrop provides 4%. The PPO is very costly, like $5500 per year for a family. The worst thing of all (this sounds trivial but it isn't), Raytheon uses Lotus Notes instead of Outlook. LN absolutely sucks (there's even a website out there called \"I hate lotus notes\").\r\nDue to mergers, there are still several \"Raytheons\" each with its own culture and management chains. For example, Raytheon El Segundo managers don't talk to Raytheon Fullerton managers. This is not good if you are interested in switching locations for example. It's like there are two different companies.\r\nFinally, because Raytheon is in El Segundo, family housing is either extremely expensive or very far away. You can't have everything: quality, close by, affordable. Pick two. If it is affordable it and close it is \"the hood\". If it is affordable and high quality it is far away. If it is close and high quality, then it is expensive. The 405 freeway is almost an invisible line between the expensive, South Bay housing and the rough neighborhoods east of the 405. Many people commute in 50 miles on vanpools from Ventura County, the Inland Empire, and Orange County but as mentioned above, Raytheon is really cool on working hours so people come in early or late to beat traffic."}, {"review_title": "Good benefits and interesting work, but sometimes a bit too \"old school\".", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "22 Aug 2013", "job_title": "Engineering Manager in Tewksbury, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1) Benefits and Work/Life Balance.

They also offer tuition reimbursement for advanced degrees, and there are opportunities on certain projects to get paid for your overtime -- even as a salaried employee.  Nobody will make you feel bad for taking time off, even during busy times of the year. \r\n\r\n2) The Work.  This is a large company that develops a wide array of interesting products for military customers.  They handle product development as well as a lot of their own manufacturing, so at many work sites you can simply walk down the hall and see how whatever you're creating fits into the larger picture of a massive defense system.", "cons": "I don't mean to stress the cons, but these are the things that are \"less than ideal\". \r\n\r\n1) Performance incentives straight out of communist Russia.  Yearly bonuses for anyone below executive level are silly small (2-4%) and aren't based on individual performance, but overall business unit and company performance.  Also, don't expect anything but a single-digit percentage raise...that's even if you consistently perform well, get a great performance rating, and get promoted.  Then crack open the annual report and see some execs making multimillions that are getting better percentages from year-to-year. Average raises for engineers are 3% or 4%, with max around 8%. This is especially troubling for younger employees that need quicker growth to pay off student loans and start families.  I've seen many bright engineers that start after college leave after 3-5 years and get 20%-30% raises to go to commercial companies (or even other defense contractors).  As a result, much of the young top talent leaves quickly for greener pastures.  That, and the fact that it's difficult to innovate due to points 2 and 3, below. \r\n\r\n2) Aging workforce.  They sure do know their stuff, but a lot of employees are grumpy old defense personalities from the tail end of the cold war era.  They're also 90% men and they will make up the majority of your co-workers.  I've heard estimates that as many as 50% of the company's engineers are aged 50 or older.  Therefore, if you're 35 or younger, prepare to constantly feel like you're working with your dad...or grand-dad. Holy cynicism, batman.  Expect change to happen very slowly. \r\n\r\n3) Bureaucracy.  The federal government imposes a seriously stifling wet blanket of rules and regulations on defense contractors.  Pretty much everything is hugely confusing and difficult to navigate (think of doing your own taxes to the twenty-fifth power).  There's redundancy in the government's own product line, and the sea of acronyms, paperwork, and process can make you feel small, inefficient, and like it's impossible to understand anything or get anything done.

Management, the people responsible for staffing engineering projects, is usually good about letting an employee change jobs.\r\n\r\nCo-workers are very competent and pleasant to work with.\r\n\r\n\r\nPush from senior management to transform company culture to look more inline with today's trends like: ethics, work life balance, health and fitness, diversity (in every sense of the word, not just ethnic), etc.", "cons": "The entire performance review and merit increase process is a mess. Section managers, they don't work with you on a day to day basis since it's a matrixed organization, collate and summarize employee achievements from various technical leads, the day to day bosses. The various section managers rank their employees and compete with employees belonging to other section managers; this forms a department rank where higher ranked employees get larger raises and faster promotions. Good section managers frame their employee synopsis within the greater business context and show employee value where applicable --they add glitz and glamor. Poor section managers merely do what they need --and barely so. The process is too dependent upon the chance of a good/bad section manager.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe merit increase process, or annual raises suffers from addressing only the middle part of the bell curve; and does not allow for exceptions and performers at the tails of the distribution. Exceptionally poor performers are put on a alternative performance development plan and still get a raise, albeit less than the average 3%. Exceptional performers are granted anywhere from 5-6% raises. Promotions range from 6-10%. The process breaks down when 1) an employee is hired in at a lower grade level than the duties and responsibilities the employee is capable of, 2) exceptionally good workers that perform much faster than their counterparts, and 3) employees are hired in at an artificially inflated level.\r\n\r\nNew employees must endure through several performance reviews before they are promoted; hence they pay grade is progressing slower than that of their similarly qualified peers. Additionally, engineering grades below E03, Senior Systems Engineer I, are treated as second class employees for they aren't offered leadership or managerial positions, they can not participate in the technical honors program, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a particularly brilliant employee is hired in and achieves a variety of miracles their reward will be stifled by the process in order to maintain 'pay parity'. Empirical observations show parity is maintained chiefly by education, years of experience in the field, and company seniority. That is to say, a miracle worker with a BS and 3 years experience will never out pace a freshly hired PhD until much later in the employee's career. Similarly, management will promote/prefer employees who perform marginally less, but have been at the company longer as opposed to a newer better performing employee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last concern is a concern throughout the industry; when a company attempts to poach engineers from a competing firm. Employees require an incentive to offset the momentum loss of their previous place of employment; this incentive is usually monetary. The process breaks down when a poached employee is offered a higher pay grade and salary than he/she may deserve. This creates workplace resentment, and more tangibly it devalues organic career growth. Why would I stay at Company X and get a 3% raise if I can jump to Raytheon and get a 20% raise w/ a promotion? \r\n\r\nAs stated somewhat earlier (under the GOOD section), members in middle and senior leadership promptly and correctly identify trends and issues within the company. They even perform an admirable job in forming a vision and enabling change. However, the endeavor takes a nosedive somewhere during the execution phase. Since enacting change within a Directorate or a business area usually involves scores of people I am not sure where or why the process breaks down; it just does. Obviously, the outcome is that the problem is never fixed and the company hobbles on.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhrases such as: 'mission assurance', 'ramp speed', and the entity known as 'six sigma' are examples of colossal failures in an attempt to address quality, poor foresight, and efficiency. The company commonly uses the phrase 'mission assurance' in an effort to instill the culture of producing quality work. Unfortunately, many employees find the corporate jingle laughable; they believe it to be more of a product stemming from the nationalistic propaganda machine found in WWII. Similarly, the phrase 'ramp speed' was formed to set the workplace tempo for employees to get more work done than expected. I believe the need for 'ramp speed' was Raytheon's poor workforce positioning; the company was decimated by the late 90's defense cuts, and unready for the onslaught of contracts in the immediate-post 9/11 environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nA business' need to optimize processes and procedures is clear and ever present, but inline with this review's motif Raytheon fails miserably on execution. Emphasis on the Six Sigma process is best defined as 'non-value added waste'. All employees are required to complete a six sigma project within the first year of employment. The project aims to incur cost savings through the creation of a more efficient process --create an assembly line out of a current procedure. This might work well in some environments, but the software development and systems engineering isn't one of them. I believe failure stems from the fact the Six Sigma process was designed for manufacturing type environments, and through the company's lack of innovation --or laziness and ineptness-- they've managed to shoehorn a circle peg into a square hole.\r\n\r\n\r\nRaytheon is making to effort to hide its ambition to be the best lead systems integrator (LSI) in defense. Unfortunately, this creates a dichotomy between the company's technical roots (Raytheon- building great radars, Raytheon/Hughes- building great missiles and bombs, and Raytheon/E-systems- no idea what they do), and the competencies they wish to obtain. Being an LSI places emphasis on project management skills and Systems Engineering in a universally accepted sense of the word (every engineer that doesn't fit a standard mold is labeled Systems Engineer). Employees that seek and excel in those Systems Engineering roles seem to ascend the corporate ladder much faster than those who seek to hone their technical understanding."}, {"review_title": "Great company, interesting work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jul 2008", "job_title": "Project Management Intern in Burlington, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nothing's cooler than working in the defense industry - your work is helping to save lives.

If you're working on a high profile project with mostly 'A' team engineers, the team will be highly intelligent, energetic, and motivated and will have the ear of management.\r\nRaytheon IDS is going through tremendous growth right now thanks to the resurgence of the Patriot missile.  Because of foreign demand for the Patriot system, Raytheon has a large backlog of work that needs to be completed in a short time frame.", "cons": "First of all, although engineers who prove their intelligence to technical management are treated well, it's a whole different story for everyone else.  Most of the interesting work and new opportunities fall to the 'A' team, while those on the 'B' team (ie everyone else) are left to languish on boring assignments.  Engineers who fail to get noticed by leadership early in their careers are often stuck in the same role for years (or decades) or shuttle from program to program without the chance to build any subject matter expertise.  \r\nEmployees can get stuck on the 'B' team track for a number of reasons: they weren't in the right place at the right time to get noticed early in their careers; they're on the shy side and don't speak up about opportunities to grow their skill sets; they have a boss who is too busy to care about their development; they're really good at performing a tedious job that no one else wants to do; they are of average ability; or they are just plain incompetent.  Be careful not to get stuck on the 'B' team.  If you haven't had the opportunity to get noticed in your first couple years at Raytheon, you probably never will.  Also, be aware of working on or leading teams that consist mostly of 'B' teamers.  Raytheon never fires anybody (short of an employee sexually harassing someone or stealing from the company), so there is a fair amount of dead weight hanging around.  These employees can be difficult to motivate and produce poor quality work because they know their jobs are safe no matter how poorly they perform.\r\nRaytheon is struggling to deal with all the new Patriot work it has coming in.  The company has done a horrible job of keeping up with the logistics of an expanding project.  For instance, the site in Andover, where most Patriot work is performed, started running out of space 8 months ago.  They are just now in the slow process of acquiring more office space.  Many engineers have been doubled up in cubicles for 3, 4, or even 5 months.  Because of the nature of defense work, most engineering is performed in classified computers labs where computers are claimed on a first come, first served basis.  The main Patriot computer lab is getting to the point where there are more users then computers and engineer are having to wait for a free computer.  Most of the computer lab's Matlab licenses recently expired, so engineers have been unable to use key Matlab tools and their work has been slowed while management fights over which department should be paying for new licenses.  \r\nExisting employees are feeling overwhelmed by the influx of new hires and transfers from other programs.  Management is too busy to take the time to train new employees, so they are thrown in and left to fend for themselves."}, {"review_title": "30+ years of stable employment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Oct 2009", "job_title": "Manager in El Segundo, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not many people in my area get laid off.

There are far too many Power-Point senior employees who have built their career on this paradigm. Middle management appears to have a \"I've got mine, screw you\" attitude. One infamous manager got a small bag of DOD Challenge coins for his \"team\" and eBay'd them. Few actually understand or care about the technology efforts they are leading.

Note that most of the complaints here are specific to the North Texas area. CA and MA look more like the recruitment videos.\r\nMorale is not great; again, sense is that executives are the only true employees, the rest of us are just a way to bill hours. Even little things like executive staff getting small sinks in their areas while engineers have to trek water from the bathroom for coffee brings home just how little engineering means to management.\r\nConstant cramming of employees into ever smaller spaces reduces productivity (ever try to debug a problem across multiple parallel threads while 50 people around you are chatting?)\r\nCaste system in engineering -- EE at top, software at bottom. If you can't solder it or take a wrench to it, executives really have no idea what you're doing. This is reflected in resource allocation. As an EE you'll get a nicer pc, nicer cube, etc. Note you'll still be treking to the bathroom to get water for coffee, so it's not all suger and spice. (spice, get it?)\r\nNo training for new employees -- you get more training as a new employee at Starbucks than you do at Raytheon. If the Govt. doesn't pay for something, it just doesn't happen. Not uncommon to have people with the company 5 to 10 years and still not understand engineering process.\r\nBias against the \"fly over\" states. Executives / leadership sit on the coasts for the most part. Not uncommon for senior staff to still be more loyal to their old (non-existent) companies than to Raytheon; e.g. there are a lot of Hughes, E-Systems, and TI-DSEG engineers, but very, very few Raytheon engineers. \r\nA lot of the staff is RIP'd (Retired In Place). At 40-something I'm the youngest in most of my meetings. Far too many people are waiting to start their pension (the longer you stay the more you get).\r\nThe company owns every idea you produce. As one Raytheon attorney put it \"if you create a new fishing lure in your garage with 3 buddies, Raytheon owns 33%\". This is standard in corporate America, but still depressing. \r\nVery little incentive to push new ideas forward, especially if they are not in Raytheon's traditional product list.

It makes sense: the government will pay for bullets and body armor for soldiers in Iraq, but they won't research new radar systems.\r\n* Raytheon mainly does systems testing and integration. A lot of smart people get frustrated because the difficult, innovative work isn't respected. The genius who finds solutions to everything might not get compensated as well as the dummy that leads the test. If you like the research side, go work at MIT Lincoln Laboratory instead (although the pay will be about 25% less than Raytheon).\r\n* Diminishing returns on compensation. Moving up in the company is mainly a function of age, not skill. Many talented engineers that start at Raytheon leave after 3-5 years because the raises are promotions are big and fast, but hits diminishing returns quickly. Those that choose to stay longer tend to be known as \"lifers\" because they are very unlikely to ever leave the company.\r\n* Non-transferable skills.

Current workers looking for more leadership are ignored, and brand new incomers are given leadership, even if they possess zero skill or resputation, and even after they demonstrate neglible competence.\r\n- Deadlines are not realistic. The dept. \"favorites\" or popular people give themselves and their friends extra time, but then shuffle harder work or tighter deadlines to workers they don't like, or who aren't part of the \"in\" crowd.\r\n- I advise females to stay away from Raytheon El Paso. Corporate makes them hire women, but I constantly see Adv. Media relegate their female workers to secretary positions, or customer service roles, rather than training them to do the core work (this happens despite the Media manager being female). A lot of \"soft sexism\". \r\n- What's worse. The few times a female Media associate does receive attention, it has been only because Media males want to date them. I've seen this happen twice. In one case, when things ended badly,  the female left the dept. altogether.\r\n- Meanwhile, Managers don't want to deal with issues or do their own paperwork. They delegate majority of their tasks to hapless employees with zero prep, and expect everybody to stay late to do more than one job. Those who don't stay late are labeled \"negative,\" or not \"team players\"\r\n- If anybody dares to discuss an issue or project obstacle, they are cut off and spoken over, male or female. Management only listens to people who claim everything is fine, even if it isnt. Meanwhile, technical problems fester until a handful of people are voluntold to fix it after hours and without pay.\r\n- Training/IELT only promotes people that play golf with their head haunchos.\r\n- In short, I'd avoid being hired at Raytheon El Paso."}, {"review_title": "Not a great work atmosphere", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "10 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Director in El Segundo, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits package and great that they have 9/80 work schedule and the paid holiday shutdown at the end of the year.", "cons": "Management is old school.

These people get recognition, praise, awards, cash bonuses, high ratings during annual review, which leads to their promotions into higher salary grades.  \r\n\r\n    Some people, however, get stuck on an underfunded, disorganized program which is badly managed with unrealistic expectations.  Obviously, such a program does not produce good results (regardless of the engineer's skills or abilities) and it looks bad on the engineer part.  This translates to no awards, no praise, bad annual reviews, and this eventually leads to being passed up for promotions.\r\n\r\n(I've been on both sides of this fence, and have seen same happen to co-workers and friends)\r\n\r\n    A person can work one year on a crappy program, and stall his career.  The next year they can do the exact same quality of work on a good program, and get a huge boost to their career.  The problem is that tasks are handed out to people by management, and its usually just a case of \"right place at the right time\".... if you are getting off a program and there is another program that needs a person...you'll be that person.  To some degree, managers have control over who gets assigned to what program, but for the most part, they just fill openings with people as they become available, so I can't really blame management for this. \r\n\r\n------ Politics\r\n    There are some politics here.  Managers and supervisors have an \"in-crowd\" of people, who seem to get more \"perks\"  these can range from getting the first chance to sign up for a limited capacity of an interesting course/training (to help further their career), to others being asked to go to industry and trade conferences, and sometimes, getting first pick at some real interesting new task becoming available.  \r\n\r\n------ Middle and Upper Management\r\n    They seem to be a group of friends who just rotate around in same jobs, with different titles every time there is a re-org.  These people all have a history of working together a long time ago at some same company, and even their families are friends with each other...its likely that if you are not a part of this circle, it would be hard to get in.\r\n\r\n----- Atmosphere and People\r\n    Being a defense contractor, you can expect most of the people here to be pretty politically conservative.  If you are not...it may be wise to keep your views to yourself.

Plus Raytheon hangs on to them no matter what if they've been there for 35 year and do nothing, because they have put in the time. Or so it feels. Degree's are very important at Raytheon, without an Engineering degree your doomed. It doesn't matter how hard you work, if you come in on weekends, stay late and get positive annual reviews. Also success of the program you're on doesn't matter either. Other programs could be put on hold, terminated and co-workers with more year will be shifted to your program creating a log jam. Eventually something has to give and layoffs follow.\r\nTraining is poor. Raytheon wants you to do it on your own time. The technology is pretty dated. I saw many young and fresh employees come to Raytheon just to end up being bored and complaining about how they're not using anything they learned in college.\r\nManagement can be distant, some are only concerned with pleasing their boss and not their employees. They do tend to play favorites at time. Some managers are not truly meant to be managing others, they are engineers and frankly don't have the people skills it takes to actually manage a section. Raytheon though forces them to become section managers for little to no financial increase and added work load. \r\nSix Sigma is a joke at Raytheon.

Bear in mind everything I'm saying is for the office in Portsmouth, RI, and for the biggest program over there, which is in a \"maintenance stage\", your experience might be very different in other programs/location. \r\nFor a Software Engineer, unless you're planning to move to management or leadership and you REALLY like this industry (the military, defense, politics) I do not recommend you stay here too long as your skills as a \"Software Developer\" are going to quickly deteriorate and come to a halt, it might become really hard to get a job in Software/Technology companies after getting used to how things are done here. Salaries are comparable to other defense companies, but really below to what the market offers in commercial companies (When I switched to my current employee my salary literally doubled), Health Insurance is just bad, very expensive high deductive plans . Needless to say, there are a lot of great people here and I feel grateful for how well they treated me and all the opportunity I was given. \r\n Some of the highlights for the Pros: \r\n- There are some really nice and smart people that work here, people are willing to help you and guide you through on baby steps. \r\n- 9/80 schedule, you get every other Friday off (standard in Defense Contractors) \r\n- Modtime: you can adjust your schedule within reason to complete your hours for the week (this is double edge sword, as you are expected to record your time by the minute, more on this on the cons) \r\n- 10k Education Reimbursement (at least at the time I was there).\r\n- Overall a very relaxed environment (although this depends on the project/location), but in general you just worry about putting in your hours for the week and you're done.\r\n- 2 Weeks off in December because of the Holidays.", "cons": "Oh boy... where do I start? There's a lot of things I didn't like about this place, and a lot of it is baked in the culture already, either because people here have only worked here and they don't know any better, or \"that's just how things are\" in the defense industry.\r\nThere is a lot \"Factory Worker\" mentality here (at least with Software Engineers), you're expected to record your hours by the minute, and by that, I mean that different task/projects get different \"charge codes\" allocated to them and you're supposed to record and \"charge\" to those \"codes\" for every task you do. That leads to some really awkward moments, like meetings that you have to \"make up\" the time for because there is no charge code associated with them. A lot of people avoid company events because that would mean that you would have to end up making up the time for it (All-hands meetings, different organizations activities, etc). A lot of the mandatory training you'll have to make up in you're own time (although leadership was trying to change this by the time left). Yup, you read that right \"MANDATORY TRAINING\" on \"YOUR OWN TIME\", and we're not talking about training that is going to be useful to you in your career as an Engineer, I mean \"Ethics\" module and what not... \r\nThis factory mentality leads to other things like holidays only providing you 8 hours to charge on 9 hour days and you having to make up 1 hour for every holiday. \r\nWork from home, allowed in certain programs, but very discouraged, you'll have to write a direct letter to your supervisor and manager explaining where you're going to \"spend those hours\". Snowday? Forget it, you can just do mod time or PTO. I even heard they were trying to make people use PTO or make mod time during the COVID-19 crisis. These are things that would be unacceptable in any other company, but here everybody is used to it so everybody dismisses it as \"is just the way it is\". \r\nMy last point, probably the most important one and the reason I left, is that you won't be doing a lot of \"Engineering\" here. The biggest program here is the \"maintenance\" stage. Meaning that you'll be going through a big pile of technical debt trying to fix bugs and implement minor functionality. All of these with technology decades old, no tools and vision to fix the root of the problems(IDE? nah we use vim, Version Control? You'll be stuck with Clearcase, etc...). Don't expect to be attending seminars about the latest industry trends and/or best practices, don't even think about doing training outside the corporate modules about the technologies you're currently working with (which again, are at least 15 old). \r\nAt the end of the day, if for some reason the program you're working loses funding (common in defense), you'll have a very weak foundation to continue your career in Software, at least outside defense."}, {"review_title": "My first job out of college....", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Oct 2009", "job_title": "Electrical Engineer I in Tewksbury, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Had opportunity to do a lot of travel (as all the other experienced engineers did not have a desire to be away from family)\r\nStarting compensation was a lot higher than many other offers I received at the time.\r\nEveryone was pleasant to work with.", "cons": "As an entry level, one can be easily stuck doing busy intern work...not a diverse work culture, mostly middle aged and old employees, more difficult for a young engineer to fit in immediately and have respect."}, {"review_title": "Great benefits and pay.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Oct 2009", "job_title": "Consulting Financial Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent benefits.

The old school culture encourages people to hide behind \"processes\" and resist change. Seniority and length of service weighes heavily on advancement. Being in this industry, the company promotes a self protective and risk adverse culture, leading to CYA type of behavior and offering little incentive for innovation.\r\n\r\nWork environment is very, very dull, with little to no social interaction between coworkers. Hard to build a network and long lasting working relationships when there're no organized team building activities or other opportunities to bond outside of work. Depending on location, work facilities are often old, run down and poorly managed. Depending on the group you are in, you could be pressured into working nights and weekends, week after week, with no financial or time compensation. The tone is that you should be grateful to have this job.\r\n\r\nCommunication and decision making is definitively top-down at all levels of management, with no attempt to solicit input from the rank and file. Every new process or slogan is pushed down your throat with little forewarning and no attempt to get feedback. This type of environment easily makes employees feel unvalued, whether or not it's management's intention."}, {"review_title": "Unfeeling, depressing place to work, but it pays well with good benefits", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Sept 2011", "job_title": "Principal Software Engineer in Indianapolis, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Variety of work assignments\r\nPotential to travel (if you like that)\r\nVariety of locations that Raytheon has a presence (if you want to transfer within Raytheon)\r\nPay is competitive\r\nBenefits are extremely hard to beat", "cons": "Ugly building.

A big disappointment for me was that I was promised the 9/80 work schedule, that was a huge lie, they frown upon the 9/80 work schedule. In fact, after I got hired I was told I couldn't take every other Friday off.

If you have more managers than actual employees, there is something really wrong.\r\n\r\nThey can't hire people locally as the locals know it is the worst place to work at, and the attrition rate is through the roof, people come and go every year as soon as their 1 year relocation agreement is up they are out the door.

However, since out of town folks don't know and haven't heard the local horror stories of working at Raytheon in Forest, MS they come in only to figure out that they just made a big mistake. Be aware of getting hired full time as they can lay you off at any time, so basically you are just a contractor. If the contracts are good with money then things are okay, as soon as the money and contracts start running out then prepare for hell. The environment of FEAR is present and that's the \"Motivation\" to work harder. Basically, FEAR of layoff so you have to be there weekends, you have to work overtime, you have to work third shift, you have to forget about vacation, you basically sign your life away. I have gotten threats of getting fired, I have had to lie to employees to make them come during weekends and work overtime to meet some unrealistic schedule and dates.

Don't work here.\r\n\r\nHR is a joke, they will lie to you to get you on the door, don't listen, don't come in, find yourself another job at a different location.
