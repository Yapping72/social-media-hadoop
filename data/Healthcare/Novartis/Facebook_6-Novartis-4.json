No encouragement to improve, and you won't have time for training or looking past your plate. Your plate will be full, all the time.

They received word that the application of the colleague to the position was rejected in the system by the same manager, without any explanation, some time before that.

Expectations are flip-flopped, people are thrown under the bus, feedback is not provided but then they escalate everything and claim deficiencies when they never brought it up or pointed out they thought there was a gap so it could be addressed. Talk about hostile environments - certain members of the team speak about people in the same room negatively in Spanish right in front of them, without realizing that some of them understand what's being said about them. Our management couldn't support us enough to protect us from the BU's tendencies of making us work around the clock with 18-20 hour days, 7 days a week, and it's not seasonal - it's year-round. One week changes are made and approved, the next week it's like a complete 180 happened and everyone has to scramble constantly. Despite working around the clock and delivering a powerful presentation, positive recognition is lacking. Most people working with this team have been chased away single-handedly and if the remaining team members are still there, then no doubt they will be leaving soon.
