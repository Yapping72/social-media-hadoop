However, when there is no room for you to grow or go to the next job or level then you are ostracized and greatly diminished.  In the last four years, the HR function has been weakened and people have been put in roles that do have the depth of experience.  Too many good colleagues in the organization were pushed out, not because they were not effective but because it\u2019s all about personality and who likes who.  I worked in both Pharma and in Group and Pharma was not as political.  You were rewarded for great work and valued.  In Group, it was all about who could get to the top and your colleagues were constantly elbowing you out of the way so they could get the next position.  I\u2019ve never really seen anything like this.  If you are a specialist in the HR arena I would recommend this is not the right organization for you at the time.  The current senior HR leadership team values the generalist much more than the specialist.   Rather go to an organization that truly values the expertise you bring.  The problem with Novartis\u2019 Talent Management is that on paper they say one thing to you but in reality your managers are not being honest and telling you what a realistic career path is for you in the organization.   Some leaders are better than others but typically you don\u2019t good coaching and feedback to improve your performance.  There is a lot of gotcha at the end of the year, which is completely unnecessary.  When I decided to leave the organization because I truly wanted to contribute and I was being given work below my level,  I was uninvited to meetings and was given very little work to do.  In all my years, I\u2019ve never seen such waste in an organization. All other jobs I had, I worked up until the moment I left.  Novartis must have so much money that they don\u2019t care if they pay big salaries and an employee does very little work.\r\n\r\nThe other downside of Novartis is it\u2019s very far behind in technology enablement.  A lot of the processes are manual or if they are automated there are too many steps.  Employees spend a lot of time doing low value work or working around processes that don\u2019t work.  It\u2019s not a culture of process improvement so people don\u2019t stop and say we need to fix this.  For a company that has so many resources, they need to invest in technology enablement and digitilizaiton to truly fulfill it\u2019s potential.\r\n\r\nAlthough the company wants to be more innovative, the current performance management system does not allow it since you don\u2019t get partial credit for taking risks and trying new things.  You get a great performance rating if you do what your manager wants and you color in the lines.

But if three people were not working at all of if they quit and there were vacancies in the team, we would still be held to the same sales goals. Novartis applied a \"one size fits all\" sales model all over the US. We was frustrating because if something worked well in Dallas it must work well in Seattle, even if it clearly didn't. When this was brought to upper managements attention nothing was done about it. Additionally Novartis expected you to do about 10 to 15 hours of administrative clerical work a week, but you were not allowed to do the work between the hours of 8 and 5 because at that time you were supposed to be in the field making sales calls. On top of that you were expected to do approximately five late night dinner programs a month on your own time, This crushed any work/life balance. \r\n\r\nI left Novartis by choice.

I think it is relevant to note that the phone some employees were given is not  supported by IT. At the time of the training, IT only provided support for iPhones. I was one of at least half the group who was given a Samsung. IT was not aware that no everyone had received an iPhone and when they found out told me that this phone would never be able to connect to the network which means that you would need to use the data plan to use the internet. I went through more than half my data in 2 days just uploading and installing programmes which Novartis deemed necessary to have on the phone.\r\n\r\nDiversity: Novartis also sold the fact that there are more than 20 nationalities working at the Prague office. I can imagine that this would or could be a great thing.", "cons": "This company is not interested in people who have a difference of opinion or even an opinion for that matter. You are expected to just say yes and keep your nose to the grindstone.\r\n\r\nCommunication: during the induction training (more than 25 new hires started at the same time as I and the new hire tendency will only increase by the looks of it) I was literally the only person who asked questions. I was then told at the end of the 3rd and last day of training that at least one of the trainers had complained that I was asking too many questions. In a normal company how is that possible and how can that kind of feedback be taken seriously? If you cannot ask questions when you are new, then when?\r\n\r\nOpen communication/open door policy simply does not exist. People will eat with you in the cantine and smile to your face but then stab you in the back and complain to your manager without blinking an eye.\r\n\r\nI was disparaged and verbally threatened by Novartis management and therefore went on long term illness. That is why I am no longer there. Labour laws in the Czech Republic are very different than in other EU countries. The fact that most employees are not aware of their legal rights (mainly those who are not Czech but not exclusively) gives Novartis a very strong upper hand.\r\n\r\nAlready told during the interview that you are expected to remain in the role for at least a year i.e. job opportunities based on merit are not a given.\r\n\r\nThis is a prime example of yet another company who moved a good chunk of their business from an expensive country to another country simply to find cheap labour. They are not interested in the well-being of their employees and since they seem to believe that they control the job market that they can do whatever they please with employees. \r\n\r\nWorking at home was also sold as a perk even though everybody knows that if or when you are given this option, it is clearly with the expectation that you will work even longer since you will not have to travel.
