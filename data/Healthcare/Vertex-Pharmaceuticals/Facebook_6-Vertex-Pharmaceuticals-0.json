If the sub-culture in these suit you then gold, if not it can range from exasperating to driving you and the best colleagues out the door. I have seen this in more than one department over the years. As an example, I once had a line manager who would freak out if I would talk about anything material to any management level above them. This is a big red flag. Recommend that you talk to as many people as possible during interview and offer stages to get sense of the sub-culture, which is just as or more important than the great macro-culture. Ask about their colleagues, boss, boss's bosses. Ignore this at your peril. Maybe won't break the deal for you, but at least you will have better idea what your getting into. 2) A sense of urgency is good, but some mid to upper level managers seem to foster and thrive on crisis-of-the-day adrenaline rush. 3) While you do have flexibility in schedule and career path, you are expected to work hard and creatively. Exceeding expectations is the expectation. Some managers are better than others in supporting you in this. The micro managers are typically detrimental, which leads to career stagnation. Even so, Vertex is above average in helping you find a way out of this, e.g. by opening up alternative career paths. 4) This is a company that is constantly growing and transforming.

A whole new layer of management was created/hired at the top who don't add any value to getting things done. People who got the work done down at the bottom were laid off or ran for the exits realizing they had no potential for promotion anymore. The race for the exit has been accelerating in 2022 from what I hear - I was shocked at some of the people I saw who have left in 1Q22. The contractors (nor all the new layer of management for that matter) don't know FDA regulations so hopefully there is no audit coming. The CIO mostly hires people who he knows from his last company so any Vertex culture is being extinguished in the IT dept and replaced. I thought the company's benefits and compensation were top notch but after I left I found they are about the same as everywhere else so no reason to let that slow down the run for the door. Even the exalted bonus days off are topped by the many companies now offering unlimited paid time off. The CIO is all about the \"cloud\" but everything done to make use of or migrate to the cloud was done before he worked there. The people who did that were laid off. His buddies from his last job have spent 2 years \"experimenting\" and \"researching\" the cloud with nothing of business value being delivered. A company that boasts how it puts all its money back into drug research has spent a lot of cash on this CIO's bloated management and lack of delivering business value. It has become a make work project for his friends. Lastly, they talk of diversity and inclusion but that decidedly doesn't seem to include people over 50 - the people who got the company thru the dark days of no revenue not that long ago were the primary target of being kicked to the curb when they finally had a chance to enjoy working at a company with revenue and profits. These are people who had great skills knowledge of how the company's technology worked which could have been reused in many different ways if their current job function was deemed obsolete. Rather than keep loyal employees in a time when it is very difficult to hire they were shown the door - and all their knowledge of Vertex went with them.

None. Your day to day work is extremely niched. Once you have been at the company for a short bit, you simply become a technician that follows poorly written protocols and SOPs.

Your talents, professional interests and previous work experience really don't mean anything. \r\n\r\nInept middle and upper management with no sense of professionalism. It is encouraged to \"listen hard and debate hard\". However, if you \"debate hard\" and work to come to a resolution that isn't part of your management's vision, you are talked down to and marginalized out of the work. The company's core values are rarely and selectively followed. Very little accountability and consistency amongst the management with concern to following the corporate values and the treatment of staff. The focus and direction of the workflows change on a weekly basis due to poor decision making and lack of accountability. This inept (current and former) management has lead to compliance issues within the company. \r\n\r\nProfitability and company sustainability. The company has been around for over a quarter century and profits are still not in the black. The product \"pipeline\" is referred to internally as more of a \"trickling garden hose\". It's great that CF is the company's primary focus, but there are no other therapeutic areas that are being focused on. The focus with projects in other (potential) therapeutic areas is erratic, poorly organized and extremely political. This leads to very high levels of stress, irrelevantly long days and staff burn out.\r\n\r\nDo your due diligence before applying here. There is an exodus with the staff due to the abysmal environment here. Firings, some seemingly random, are very common. Smart, independent and creative thinkers will eventually be viewed as non-compliant and will be dealt with accordingly. Be wary of the brief 5 star company reviews with this company as well. There is definitely some internal/external \"reputation management\" going on. It's a very small world in pharma here in Boston.

The integrity of management was suspect to say the least, as I witnessed scary inquiries by the US SEC (google \"Vertex COO and SEC\" if you don't believe it) and massive issues in the DMPK group regarding data integrity which resulted in effectively dissolving the internal group in favor of outsourcing all the work. Middle-management was constantly competing with other groups in the company for clout/ political turf, which made working at the team level very difficult as folks were often getting thrown under the bus. Vertex was/ is in the habit of making announcements through the press, which is certainly a double-edged sword and in my mind bad practice. Additionally, HR is nothing more than a hire/ fire department; many times I brought up inconsistencies with management and in one instance how an internal survey conducted indicated there needed more management engagement with \"lower\" employees, but in discussion with HR there wasn't going to be any transparency regarding the metrics of the survey because ultimately management didn't want to accept long-term culpability.
