Management has no clue or doesn't care, even after years of employees telling them that we are understaffed.  The company is paying for it in errors made, investigations, etc.  There's little flexibility in scheduling because we are \"the front line.\"  Standard Work (efficiency program) has only made the work environment worse, with inexperienced people doing jobs infrequently across the department creating more errors and investigations.

Specifically, Pfizer is less likely to do research in diseases / conditions that will not guarantee a return of at least >/= $1 billion annually.  As a result, I found a lot of the research to be more \"reegineering\" established products than conducting innovative research.  Additionally the culture has become a lot more competitive than collaborative; colleagues are more likely to try to take credit for work that they may have not done completely individually themselves.  Pfizer used to be a data driven company, now it is a company driven by relationships...it's not what you know but who you know.
