They have processes however all employees are cutting corners or \"dissapear\" (usually sick leave, or family emergency) when their function has to give an input. I never seen anywhere in pharma industry so many people taking sick leave around tight deadlines, just to avoid work or not to take on responsibility for their team. No proper training is giving to new starters but the management expectation is for you to know everything and take responsibility for the mess that other employees are causing (learn how to run first before you walk). Unfortunately, blaming culture is everywhere and protected people are not accountable for their bad work (but line managers are very good in hiding the weakness of the team and their own). Line managers are promoted just because they belong to the \"club\" but not because of their accomplishments (minimum to none). Some created a lot of mess and still are appraised for \"their hard work\". I understand that everyone wants to impress the upper management, but think about your direct reports and also support their development. Line managers take on your work as their own and obviously they present to upper management without involving you (hierarchical company). Management is hiding compliance problems and simply lies into your face. Too much female professional and personal jealousy. This company is a real cat fight ring, as some women can be targeted to be put in their place just because they have integrity and want to do the right thing or they work very hard and by default, without any bad intention,make their line manager look very stupid and incompetent. BMS is bragging to support woman and are all about diversity, yet the management does the opposite. I heard stories of pregnant women with strong symptoms who were exposed to a lot of pressure, stress and forced to work long hours, but never had any support from upper management nor HR. BMS does not respect your privacy and private medical information can be shared without your consent under the \"excuse\" of an occupational health assessment (recommended for your own good...). Probably they never heard of GDPR and HR can be very incompetent. Too many meetings (some not needed) and not enough time to complete your work. Line manager expects you to work long hours (even weekends) to fulfil your objectives because \"it is your responsability and this is how BMS is\". You have to be available for your line manager 24/7, including on annual leave...

Do not buy into their diversity and inclusion because it is none exist at the Phoenix site. \n\nMediocre people are consistently promoted because they are friends with managers and directors. Not every department is held accountable. \n\nPeople have been leaving the Phoenix site in droves but HR isn\u2019t having exit interviews because they don\u2019t care. They want to get rid of all the hCelgene people and replace them with BMS people. \n\nThe health insurance is very low tier. It\u2019s expensive and doesn\u2019t cover much. They have unlimited sick time but the Phoenix is always trying to find a way to not honor it. \n\nThe LTI is a joke only directors and above get stock. BMS took away all stock from hCelgene employees which made up 25-30% of their total compensation and did not replace it. So we were paid less once BMS took over. \n\nAvoid QC incoming their Manager is ill equipped to be a people manager. She is self centered and only thinks about herself. She is stuck in a 1950s work place and wants to stay there, she believes people shouldn\u2019t talk about their pay. I talked to her about my dissatisfaction with my pay. I was being paid less then the white woman that I was training and that had nowhere near the experience that I did. She decided to be self center and initially complained that people shouldn\u2019t talk about their pay because now everyone is ganging up on her and everyone has animosity towards her. I was the only person talking to her about it but she was more concerned about how she felt then how I felt. She cannot be trusted, I was out on approved FMLA, which she convinced me to cancel because I could work from home to benefit the team, for her to only demand me back to site when the arrangement no longer worked for her. She is quick to assume everything and once she assumes it, it now becomes fact even when she is proven wrong. She will hold a grudge until the end of time. Once she doesn\u2019t like you or your on her bad side it\u2019s time for you to get a new job outside the company because she will make sure to block your advancement and she will pick at you the whole time. Wherever she wants to go back on her word she will all of a certain \u201cforget\u201d everything that was talked about like that is a good excuse."}, {"review_title": "location is important, but i like and would recommend my location in Seattle, WA", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Research Associate in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I was hired when it was Juno therapeutics as a startup, was acquired by Celgene who was then acquired by BMS a year or two later. working at Juno was great, incredibly smart and hard-working scientists, everyone is willing to help one another and a stellar atmosphere to work under.
