They refuse to negotiate, it's \"take it or leave it.\" My best advice: leave it. \r\n\r\nHR won't process promotions if they think the manager wants to pay you too much, and then won't tell anyone why there hasn't been any progress unless you harass them. As a technician, you'll probably make more money pushing carts at Target, I only stayed for pharmacy experience while I was applying for pharmacy school. If you're looking for a company that will drastically increase your workload and then cut available hours, CVS won't let you down. \r\n\r\nThey also refused to give any hazard pay throughout the pandemic, despite deeming their employees essential. We got a minuscule bonus for the entire year, which they were so proud of. They are cheap and they don't care.\r\n\r\nI have not met a single pharmacist, technician, store manage, or front-store employee that has been happy with this company. The stress is not worth it.
