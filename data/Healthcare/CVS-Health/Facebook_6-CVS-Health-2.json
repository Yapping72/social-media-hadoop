The job title is a scam, management does not trust the employee for a bit, they set ridiculous metrics that are so unrealistic and put employees under pressure to meet metrics, your idle time is being monitored like a clock, you can't be on the phone doing CVS work without pressing a button to reduce your idle time, you can't lock your computer screen for too long as the Lock Screen time is counting against you, when you are on you have to be actively working. IT FEELS LIKE SLAVERY WORKING HERE!!! The turn over rate here is massive, they have compulsory overtime during the peak season and also block out months where you can not take anytime off.

After the roll-out of covid-19 vaccines, I left work crying everyday. I was overworked and made minimum wage as a pharmacy technician. The company will give the lowest possible raise- almost insulting. I think corporate changed my pay from 15.00 to 15.33 per hour. As a very experienced pharmacy technician. My pharmacy manager thought I deserved more and fought them, and the best they could do was 16.50. The customers treated us like dirt and corporate didn\u2019t care how badly we were treated. It was actual abuse. Until recently pharmacists did not have a break and worked 12 hrs per day (completely illegal). \n\nI\u2019m so glad I left, I\u2019m so much happier. Shortly after I left, the pharmacist needed to go on medical leave for mental health related issues. The district leader was upset and \u201cwished he gave him more notice\u201d, as if that is something that\u2019s even planned. Another time one of my coworkers was called into work during a blizzard and the pharmacist was supposed to bring her. He got stuck, & her parents did not feel comfortable with an Uber driving her during the blizzard, and corporate STILL told her she needed to go in (she didn\u2019t go thank goodness).\n\nThe safety in the stores is another big issue, especially here in NYC. Everyday we here about shoplifting or armed robberies or break-ins. My friend recently started at a store as a manager (should have consulted with me first), and every day he tells me \u201cthere was more shoplifting\u201d. As employees we are told not to do anything. Even worse, some NYC stores have security guards who still let the stores get shoplifted. They honestly don\u2019t provide any security. \n\nThis company needs to do more for their employees. There\u2019s a reason why their is a retail pharmacy crisis, with everyone quitting. It\u2019s not because we\u2019re lazy, it\u2019s because we couldn\u2019t take anymore abuse. I was considering pharmacy school until this place scared me away. Instead I went to get my MBA and I can tell you there is so much wrong with management at this company. It\u2019s really simple, respect & protect your employees, pay them a fair salary (especially since pharmacy school is expensive), offer decent benefits, and don\u2019t abuse the employees. This is the only way the company will ever reduce their turnover. CVS makes so much money and the company can afford to provide better wages and benefits to the employees. This company has profited so much from the covid 19 pandemic and hasn\u2019t given anything to retail store employees. Everything is for corporate. They had an $18 million contract with NBC to do covid 19 testing and despite working 16 hr days, we didn\u2019t see much of the profit. \n\nAnyway, I would not recommend CVS. Instead I got an internship at a small company that pays much more, offers employees lunch everyday, benefits, and management is very understanding."}, {"review_title": "its ok", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Digital Messaging- Client Services", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "you get to help people", "cons": "the lack of raises and performance bonuses. as well as  the employer transferring everyone around to different areas every 3-4 months"}, {"review_title": "CVS Health", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative (CSR) in Winston-Salem, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have learned alot of how to mutitask on a computer and how to located cases alot about different coverages.

During the interview process, the Regional Mngr lied to me about certain details of the job, how the training was gonna go, and how the company is \"always hiring cause there's usually a revolving door when it comes to turnover\".  After a month of me starting work, I found out from another senior level mngr that they were on a hiring-freeze due to \"corporate restructuring\". The training was a joke! I only got one week of minimal training before they started moving me to other low-performing stores to help out. They also expect u to complete your training modules on a tablet while you're working on the floor & have to score a 100% on all the assessments to pass. Lastly, after the first cpl months of me working there, the Regional Mngr didn't come to visit me in-person once to check how my training was going or talk to me about some of the issues I was having. She pretty much told me what I wanted to hear during the interview just to get me hired & throw me to the wolves.\n2. Even if you're hired in any management role (or S.M.I.T. like I was given my 15yrs of mngt experience), you won't be able to act like an actual Mngr! Your subordinates walk all over u & refuse to listen to your simple directions cuz: not to sound like a sexist, but the majority of staff they hire r female who have trouble listening to a male authority figure & most importantly...they give all your subordinates the title of either Supervisor/Mngr (even the young ones in their late teens/early 20s who havent even finished school yet) so they can be given \"over-ride\" capabilities on the registers to scan items that need an I.D. check so the Store Mngr doesn't have to keep going up to the front of the store routinely to give them their over-ride. This is another reason y your underlings have a hard time listening to their \"boss\" cuz they all have a false sense of entitlement & think they know better than a experienced Mngr with 1.5 decades of experience.\n3. They have VERY old equipment that'll make your job a living hell. According to an I.T. guy that has been working for company close to 25yrs who came to our store one day to help fix our automated checkout machines, when I asked him out of curiosity, he said the registers were a little over 20yrs old & the self-checkout machines were about 11-12yrs old.

There would not be time to scan it in anyway, considering the pittance number of payroll hours.
