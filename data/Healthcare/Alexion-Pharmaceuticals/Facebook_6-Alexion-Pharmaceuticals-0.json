We had all these new people but nobody had a clear understanding of what their role was in the new organization.  In addition, the new hires were disproportionately director level and higher.  They were strategic thinkers and more accustomed to leading rather than rolling up their sleeves and doing the work.  The work day changed from 12 hour days of doing actual work to 10 hour days of sitting in meetings trying to figure out who was going to do the actual work.  Despite the longer hours, I found it more satisfying in the beginning.\r\n\r\nAlexion\u2019s Upper management was very much out of touch with the level of effort and associated costs associated with enterprise-wide projects.   There was no prioritization, projects were underfunded and we took on more than we could reasonably handle.  The end result was project overruns, some out and out failures and most of the time, projects being completed without realizing all of the benefits that were expected.  This lack of prioritization is what lead to the work/life issues mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nI have never worked for a company where upper management was less interested in the day to day operations of the company.

There is no stability or sense of loyalty...really too bad, just thinking about what a great potential this company had and how quickly seems to deteriorate into another corporation that is wasting huge amount of money and talent.  Overhiring of VPs to lead tiny programs has led to the VPs micromanaging and practically trying to do the jobs of associate director and below levels,perhaps because they have nothing better to do or have no idea about how to lead teams...this has led only to wasteful time, money and effort management, as they have often impeded instead of helped the work.

Below I can only speak for the commercial side of the company.  For anyone interviewing, just look for yourself at how less than 10% of the people stay here longer than 2 years. This turnover includes within field sales teams, HR, market research, and marketing. Over 60+ people have left in the past 3 years - there is constant turnover and churn.  Among those full-time in HQ, very few actually permanently relocate to CT (keeping their out-of-state residence for years), which should tell you a lot about HQ employee sentiment over job security or satisfaction. The company refuses to self-reflect on why this is the case. The goals are unrealistic.  Burnout and bullying is common. Stay away if you care about your career, family, or sanity.\r\n\r\n-In an ultra-rare disease market with just a few patients per million (from public reports), there is nowhere for the stock to go but down at this point, especially as their net patient adds slow down significantly impacting a plateau for total top-line revenue.\r\n\r\n-You can probably tell from external recruiter calls and how many job postings are always up, that the company has major problems recruiting and retaining talent.  Nobody wants to live in rural Connecticut, and the internal environment is toxic, creating constant turnover.  Many people in HQ are locals who never left CT and just need a job.\r\n\r\n-Externally, Alexion has a poor reputation among its customers for extremely aggressive sales tactics and straddling ethical lines. Look at their KOL's. The company has alienated so many physician thought-leaders, that the physicians who speak for them are not true thought-leaders in their fields. The company also withholds medicines for patients in global markets if the government doesn't bend to its hostage-style negotiation tactics.\r\n\r\n-The company already has added some of the worst parts of big pharma. There are twice as many VP's as senior managers, which is ridiculous.\r\n\r\n-Multiple innovative deep-pocket competitors are rolling out new products for the same diseases soon, with better efficacy and fewer dosing based on public clinical trials.
