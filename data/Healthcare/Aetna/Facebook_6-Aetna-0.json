There is good camaraderie among workers.", "cons": "There are changes made ALL THE TIME and it is often hard to keep up. The constant changes make it easy to miss items when your charts are audited. When the STAR KIDS program first started in 2016 there were many service coordinators that were hired in with very poor pay. As of 7/2022 there are service coordinators that do not have a masters in social work and make about the same salary as the coordinators (with a masters in social work) that have slaved in the field to complete assessments and service plans. The yearly raises are a joke and the bonuses aren't that great either.  On average, the bonuses will be about 4% of your annual pay. If you consider a job in the STAR KIDS department please negotiate your pay and do not start with a low number! In 2016 there were SCII's that started with at least 50K in pay. Aetna has the ability to pay more but they do not like to. One would assume that the medical benefits would be stellar considering it is Aetna but they are definitely NOT. The medical benefits and the out of pocket cost for things is the worst I have ever had. The paid time off accrual is fair but you can only carry over 40 hours of pto each year. You have to use it or you lose it. When you take a day off you have to find someone to \"cover\" you in case something arises on your caseload and this isn't always easy. You will also be required to log into the phone queue one day a week for 5 hours and answer incoming calls. This upset almost everyone in the department because instead of hiring staff to address incoming calls they have the service coordinators do it. DO NOT GO TO HR WITH ISSUES BECAUSE YOU WILL BE BLACKBALLED!!!! Lastly, there are definitely certain workers that tell management EVERYTHING. This includes what is shared in private meetings. I would advise anyone new to this job to not over-share or express issues with management to anyone."}], [{"review_title": "They are a good company.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Project Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They have great benefits the best I have ever had.", "cons": "I can't think of any cons at the moment."}, {"review_title": "Micromanaging", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "20 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Claims Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work from home M-F Benefits Holidays Off", "cons": "Very micromanagement, too many apps too much to earn with little to no time.

They will mark you up for being 1 minute late and it will be a huge ego trip for your manager and cut down on productivity and employee moral.\r\n\r\n- LIE: Promised to be working one on one with clients building relationships and experience.\r\nTRUTH: Your boss takes all the client calls and commissions and honestly wants a less productive team so that he can make more money for himself.  i constantly tried to point out ways we could work smarter not harder and he was never willing to even consider changes or improvements to work flow.\r\n\r\nIN GENERAL::\r\n\r\n\r\nMy experience was awful.  \r\n\r\nWe printed the proposal packages for potential or returning clients on broken printers that never worked properly and wasted hundreds of hours trying to fix hardware, definitely not my job or expertise.\r\n - The printers worked properly about as often as my boss who spent most of his work day chatting about new kids on the block and his marital problems with team members.  Nothing helps get insurance policies sold like your boss badmouthing his wife to young female employees.\r\n-  In general my manager did not know appropriate demeanor toward women in the workplace. I was always alone in rooms with him and it always felt really uncomfortable.\r\n- My manager actually poached me from another company to work for him and constantly made comments about \u201csaving me\u201d from my professional reality in front of other team members (i was much happier at my previous position).\r\n- most of my team were awesome people but they spent the entire day chatting on the company chat app with me and everyone else. I don\u2019t know how they got anything done.  I often felt overwhelmed by the amount of conversations coming at me from my coworkers that had nothing to do with our work.\r\n- i was very micromanaged about some things (even non work related things like how i cooked my lunch in the kitchen) and never given proper training for more specialized tasks that require experience and company knowledge.\r\n\r\nLAST.  And unlike most things i can\u2019t blame my direct manager ENTIRELY though definitely in part,\r\n\r\nThe system we used was wildly inefficient and out of date.  Hundreds or more outdated answers to current questions were left in the system and finding the most accurate response took hours when it should have taken minutes. \r\n\r\nI created a system to organize these stock answers and when i shared it with the team my manager reassigned me to assembling packages instead of searching for answers and told higher management the idea to update and organize our system in a glossary was his (he has absolutely nothing to do with it except NOT fixing it before i got the chance)\r\n\r\nIn general i think the company was much better than the team i was working on, however, if they allow an employee in a management role to abuse his power and underperform so extensively i have to assume there are bigger issues within the company that i didn\u2019t stick around to dissect.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t work here; the money isn\u2019t great and the job, even if it wasn\u2019t a hot mess with management and outdated systems, would be wildly boring and depressing.

My pay stubs said CVS, my badge (although I was a Remote employee) said Aetna, and when I answered the phone, it was for one of their subsidiaries. When a coworker asked for clarity in training, \"Management\" couldn't even give a straight answer, because they are confused as well. That within itself, was a Red Flag. \r\n\r\nCVS, Aetna, or whatever else they call themselves, is just a big name that has been around for many years, and they lure in candidates with that, plus the incentives they provide. When you begin working for them, they will sell you the classic, \"American Dream\" by telling you how many ways you can move up in the company, and how everyone is one \"Big Happy Family\" and love to help employees, so feel free to ask TL's, Supervisors, and Managers for \"Assistance\" when you need it. Right....\r\n\r\nAfter they put you on the phone to handle calls, you will have absolutely NO SUPPORT from \"Leadership\", and you may quickly burnout from the stress that comes with the job. Not to mention, they make the job a lot more difficult than it has to be, on so many levels. \r\n\r\nFor instance, when you have a call where a Member or Provider is demanding to speak with a Supervisor, and you notify your helpful CVS/Aetna \"Supervisor\", you will be sent a link to an online job aid that tells you step by step, how to de-escalate the call. All while judging you on metrics. They also require employees to use several different systems, just to look up one simple thing, and they will train you to rely on \"Help Desk\" to get your questions answered. That way, they can pretend to be held up in \"Meetings\" all day. This is CVS/Aetna's version of, \"Support\".\r\n\r\nAlso, you may be unfortunate enough to be given a work schedule that has your first break beginning 1 hour and 5 minutes after you've just started your shift. Then, you have to sit and take calls for approx. 4 hours and 15 minutes straight, before you can go to lunch. Your last break will be scheduled 1 hour and 5 minutes before your shift ends. Business needs come first....\r\n\r\nThe high turnover is no surprise. \r\n\r\nWord of advice, after rightfully Resigning from the company, \"Leadership\" may wrongfully declare you as Terminated. This is what my \"Manager\" told me after I was courteous enough to email her and my \"Supervisor\", my Resignation Letter. \r\n\r\nFor that reason alone, I'm even happier that I left them, and I would never want to work for CVS/Aetna again, even if they begged me and offered a higher salary than I was making, lol. Not worth my time.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to discourage anyone from applying, because things didn't work out for me. This was my experience with them, and it may be a better job fit for someone else. Especially if you are unemployed, and need something fast. If you honestly feel that you can handle all of the above, this is definitely the place for you.

I'm really sorry I missed out on those.", "cons": "If Dante had been born 700 years later and worked at Aetna, he would have made New Product Development the inner-most circle of hell in his \u2018Inferno.\u2019 Where to begin?\r\n\r\n\u2014HR\u2014\r\nHR does not exist in any meaningful or helpful way. Your only resources are a barely functional website and an 800 number you can call that funnels you into an endless maze designed to send you back to the website. If Kafka and Escher had a lovechild and that lovechild was an HR infrastructure, it would be easier to navigate than Aetna's HR-themed labyrinth.\r\n\r\nDon't get me started about the actual HR department. In my experience, HR staff are only there to repeat the 800 number. At one point I had a serious medical emergency and reached out to HR with questions about taking a medical leave but received what amounted to a generic response from an HR representative reminding me of the HR number (which, in my experience, has SIGNIFICANT wait times to speak to poorly trained call centers)\r\n\r\n\u2014Tools for Success\u2014\r\nYou do not get the tools and resources you need to be successful in your work, so don't even ask. The unwillingness Aetna has to properly equip its staff with the tools they need to be successful manifests itself in many ways but is most illustrated by the laptop I was given\u2014an antique, battered, discount-level Dell with a Celeron processor and 2GB of RAM that was pre-loaded with so much corporate bloatware and spyware that it was functionally unusable. The laptop died about a week before I left, which honestly was great timing because someone needed to put it out of its misery before getting passed along to the next poor sucker.\r\n\r\n\u2014Onboarding\u2014\r\nYou do not get this either, and DEFINITELY don't ask about it.* When I logged in on my first day, I had 70 unread emails, some of which contained helpful information about the company and my job. Believe it or not, Aetna/CVS, a Fortune FIVE company, does not have any kind of formal onboarding. There are no centralized resources, no orientation sessions, no 400-page dictionary explaining the absurd amount of acronyms that are un-Googlable but required to be fluent in from Day 1 so that you don\u2019t sound like a complete dope, NOTHING. During my time in Ner Product Development, several talented people left the organization after 1-3 year stints without ever having gained a basic understanding of how the company works or how they were supposed to be successful in their roles.\r\n\r\n*Seriously, don't ask about onboarding. NPD leadership does not care about the onboarding experience and actively discouraged any informal efforts to develop materials to help new employees. That should tell you everything you need to know.\r\n\r\n\u2014Training\u2014\r\nDo you work in product but feel like you need a working understanding of how to print member communications? Well, you\u2019re in luck because Aetna has a quarterly required training for you! Do you work remotely, but still want to know how to prevent violence in the workplace? Well, you\u2019re in luck because Aetna has a quarterly required training for you! Are you desperate to understand how physical records should be managed, even though your work is completely digital, and your antique laptop would poop its own pants at the thought of having to connect to a printer? Well, you\u2019re in luck because Aetna has a quarterly required training for you! Are you a stressed-out Product Director who would give anything to understand how the company works so that he can be better and more productive at his job? Well, you\u2019re in luck because\u2014j/k, they\u2019ll never help you with that, so quit thinking about it!\r\n\r\n\u2014Product Development Process\u2014\r\nLOL. Product Development takes place within what I\u2019d call a \u201cblinded waterfall development\u201d framework where you work in nearly complete isolation from the decision-makers who decide whether your product will move on to the next stage of development. Funding for new products is minimal or non-existent, which forces stakeholders to be incredibly territorial and hesitant to sign off on new products. There are also required technical feedback sessions where dozens and dozens of stakeholders provide feedback on new product concepts. These meetings, which are required to move your product forward, usually end with one or two of the 50+ attendees derailing the conversation so that another 50+ person meeting needs to be scheduled. I\u2019m starting to think this is why our healthcare system is broken\u2026\r\n\r\nDid I mention funding? In my year at Aetna, I was never able to understand where funding came from and who needed to approve it. It was much easier to understand who can block or delay funding\u2014nearly anyone. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure as a former Aetna employee I could still go back and derail a new product, that\u2019s the Aetna difference! Products were constantly getting canceled or pushed back, even after significant resources had been invested in their development. Does the idea of a $100,000 PowerPoint deck getting shot down 5 minutes into a stage-gate meeting by a stakehoplder you\u2019ve never met and didn't even know you needed to get buy-in from excite you? Then congratulations, you\u2019re perfect for Aetna\u2014enjoy your employee discount at CVS!\r\n\r\nBut at least we moved quickly! NOT! As a member of the \u201cDisruptive Innovation Team,\u201d I was tasked with thinking about and developing solutions for new issues in healthcare. That part was really fun, and I\u2019m proud of the work I led. Unfortunately, those good ideas ran into a buzzsaw when we tried to turn them into products. I guess we just have to cross our fingers and hope that our COVID-19 ideas will be ready in time for the next global pandemic? That's not to mention all of the programs and products that gain momentum before getting mysteriously sidelined at the last minute because of \"changing organizational priorities.\"\r\n\r\n\u2014Staffing\u2014\r\nThe organization is incredibly top-heavy and everyone is overpaid. I reported up to a Senior Director (who was wonderful!), who then reported up through several levels of VPs (between 3 and 5, depending on that month's re-orgs!). I was a director but had no direct reports. There were no junior staff or analysts, and we don\u2019t staff for individual parts of the development process, so the same Product Director would lead early ideation, business case development, pilot development, implementation, and sales. This actually isn\u2019t unreasonable for a Director-level staff member, except for the fact that we were individual contributors, so we were doing every bit of work for all of these stages ourselves. Internal customer service is abysmal\u2014it\u2019s like a matrix organizational structure except there is no matrix or structure, just chaos. Leadership's way to address this, and the unbelievably inefficient product development process, was to complain about understaffing. Sure.\r\n\r\n\u2014Management\u2014\r\nWhen Socrates listed Ignorance among the passions, he might as well have been talking about NPD \u201cleadership.\u201d Despite a rapidly changing healthcare landscape, management seemed to proactively avoid thinking or learning about consumerism in healthcare, value-based care, digital health, interoperability, or anything else that might help them better navigate and address the disruption in our industry. Product leadership comes largely from consulting and sales, so rather than leveraging their client-facing experience while adapting their approach to manage a product organization, they just repeat the same complaints they heard from plan sponsors 10 years ago at Aon while refusing to learn anything about actual product development. With the incredible amount of experience WITHIN their organization, the amount of ignorance at the VP level was embarrassing.\r\n\r\n\u2014Insurance\u2014\r\nPerhaps the most frustrating part of working for Aetna is also having Aetna for an insurance provider. Aetna employees choose between three terrible, high deductible plans that left me, for the first time in my life, feeling like I didn\u2019t even have insurance. I guess I could have lucked out and broken my leg on the first day of the plan year, but otherwise, I was basically stuck paying out of pocket for my care. Most employees who had working spouses opted out, but those of us who weren\u2019t so lucky had to live with the fact that, not only didn\u2019t Aetna seem to care about its members, it also didn\u2019t seem to care about its employees. I spent part of my time looking at mental health and, in conversations with colleagues across the company, learned that many of my colleagues were paying out of pocket for their mental health care rather than deal with Aetna\u2019s absolutely abysmal behavioral health offerings.
