Like most companies with a claims department, the workload is unmanageable in a 40 hour work week. The expectations are very high, and so is the stress level.  Also, the disability benefit managers are hourly, which is unheard of in this industry. This means you cannot work even 15 minutes beyond your normal schedule without getting permission because this will be considered overtime pay. Because the disability benefit managers are hourly, they are subject to a different attendance policy than the salaried employees. Hourly employees get \"occurrences\" any time they are unexpectedly absent. If you get 4-5 occurrences in a rolling 12 month period, you can be put on probation. Therefore, I would not recommend this company to single parents, or parents of young children who are frequently ill. Additionally, the work space is not private. People sit in \"quads\" of 4 people and are almost completely open to one another with low cube walls. This is a very distracting work environment and can be very unprofessional when you are on the phone and it is very noisy in your work area.

The less you work, the less you have to do. The medical benefits are the worse I have ever seen and really expensive.  I consider getting a job at Costco or something, there medical are a lot better and you pay a lot less. I know because I use to work on that account and I would see there benefits. Even the part timers there get much better benefits. So as long as you don't need the medical benefits and you don't mind working and never having much of a person or family life.

Customer Service Reps have to take constant verbal abuse due to Claim Manager/DBM Mistakes.  Also, Most Claim Managers work on the East Coast in Plantation Florida and Portland Maine.  So, what they do is just BEFORE they conveniently leave the office for the day, they call a claimant on the West Coast or mountain time zone, leave a generic message to call back customer service-then the Claimant Calls back demanding to know why their claim was denied (which a CSR is not allowed to discuss in detail) and to speak with their claim manager.

However they are a health insurer that offers only their worst, highest-deductible health plans to their own employees.  I have a $10K deductible for myself and my daughter. Mental health services, chiropractic services, acupuncture, all of my prenatal appointments (I just received my second ultrasound bill for $1K) are considered non-essential and are therefore not covered until I meet my deductible (as yet unclear whether they\u2019d be covered even then). Every single colleague I have met whose partner is fully employed with medical coverage has chosen to be on his/her partner\u2019s insurance. Not Aetna\u2019s.\r\n\r\nAetna claims to score exceptionally well on gender equity throughout the organization, yet offer ZERO paid maternity leave to their employees\u2014forget about paternity leave. They also don\u2019t have a single HR resource to support or advocate for women navigating the very confusing and complicated process of applying for disability (6 weeks at 60% pay) and federal FMLA leave (12 weeks of job-protected unpaid leave during which you are considered an inactive employee and will be paying 100% of your health care premiums). I actually have yet to meet any HR rep within the company who advocates for the employees. Period.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, they employ a forced distribution curve for annual performance ratings, a practice which only demoralizes and demotivates high-performing employees and encourages mediocre, just-enough performance from everyone. If busting your butt, repeatedly going well above and beyond, and producing top-tier work that\u2019s applauded by executive leadership only gets you a 3 rating (i.e. average, \u201cmeets expectations\u201d performance; a 2 rating requires you be placed on a performance improvement plan which can lead to termination) then what are you trying so hard for? \r\n\r\nI have personally experienced (and heard about from other managers) a high incidence of low-performers within the organization\u2014hugely costly. I also know via my peers that it is incredibly difficult to fire someone. 99% of the time those low-performers just get moved around to different departments.\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, you have very high turnover for top talent. Not the best recipe for transforming the healthcare space.\r\n\r\nAnd... the merger with CVS has only made everything even less favorable for our employees. Our benefits are starting to be stripped away\u2014for example, no one even uses the awards and recognition program anymore either because they\u2019re no longer allowed to (only managers can give points now) or because the points are relatively worthless (1/5 the value we used to get pre-merger). I am confident this will only worsen once all benefits are completely integrated in January 2020. \r\n\r\nThere is currently no upward mobility\u2014countless promises of promotions, raises, and even just full-time status that have never been delivered. Our team is replete with contingent/contract employees who are 1-2 years later still waiting for full time status promised to them shortly after hire.\r\n\r\nAs a manager, things are especially difficult because there is very little benefit I can offer my direct reports (no promotions, nearly nothing raises, only paltry, meaningless bonuses). Its also virtually impossible to hire\u2014even to backfill for employees going out on leave and those who leave us permanently!!\u2014because we are almost never given an open requisition and often have them taken away when employees leave us.\r\n\r\nThese operational practices are damaging to your culture and ultimately unsustainable."}, {"review_title": "Wellness Culture is Amazing", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "13 Feb 2019", "job_title": "IT Project Manager in Hartford, CT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Aetna is one of the most inclusive and wellness-focussed companies around. \r\nThere are plenty of opportunities for personal and professional training and growth.

If someone calls in to simply pay a bill, you will get marked if you don't somehow empathize with them, paraphrase the issue, and summarize everything. Often times this causes members to become frustrated because they want to get off the phone. You are expected to take ownership of the call no matter how difficult it is, and you are not allowed to have time off the phones to research and call the member back. Task management and grievance teams are useless and will send your notes back with a coaching saying that you were wrong. \n\nAnother glaring issue with this company is the lack of communication between the departments. Members are frequently transferred to you by a misinformed rep from another department and then become irate when you tell them you need to transfer them again. Reps in other departments are hesitant to take calls and sometimes will outright refuse to take them.

He stated that people didn't want to take promotions if it meant returning to work in the office, and that the people in the office missed out on learning opportunities because they sent their best and brightest to work from home.\r\n\r\nIn a town hall he agreed working from home was great for employee retention and it was something people considered a benefit, much like insurance, because of the added value working\r\n from home brought. This company doesn't offer the richest benefits otherwise, and flexible work arrangements were one of the few incentives.\r\n\r\nI was one of the top performers in my unit, even though I had only been there two years. I always went above and beyond my job description, and my supervisor never had anything but amazing things to say about my work during our one on one meetings. I wanted to keep working there, my manager and department wanted me to keep working there, but because of upper managements inflexibility and seeing employees as numbers instead of people, I had to end my employment with Aetna."}, {"review_title": "employee of Aetna", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "16 May 2013", "job_title": "Claims in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I like the flex time so you are never late, I like that I can do my job with a supervisor standing over my shoulder", "cons": "The health insurance sucks,  deductibles and coinsurance is too much.

Oh and supervisors here aetna can not keep one turn over is high.  The  managers that they do have lack training some have never paid a claim.  Aetna recently in last 3 years hired kids to work smh, all day long the kids walk and talk like on a picnic.  I been working at Aetna for 6 years, and watch how benefits are taking away.  Aetna use have private food vendor in the past years come in  and sell food, but now aetna cafe which is not good and price is very high.  Aetna had a gym that was free to everybody but not it is a fee to use.   I work in the claims department and it is so unorganized and nobody can answer a question.  I  believe the  claim flow is organization is crazy.  Aetna seem  to think cross training is the way go, but cross training make lot late claims, paid wrong claims, and inventory high.  I like my job but tired of having to work other plans and than our plan is behind. I feel like aetna does not care about employees being happy, cut our benefits, took away food vendors, and no  leaders on floor.

If you were kept beneath market for many years, even a change of position will not bring you up to the current market value! \r\n\r\nEnd of year 'performance ratings' are a joke. Your Manager can rate you as a top performer, but when \"calibrated\" your rank can be reduced to fit an artificially pre-determined bell curve. This is real problem if you are a member of a small team. Merit raises are based on the rating number, so instead of really rewarding talent, it is actually viewed as a  mechanism to hold payroll aka SG&A down. \r\n\r\nDespite job scope increasing each year - no promotion, no significant increase in salary, no increase in staffing- ever. Always do more with less.  Little investment in employee morale, or the opportunity for virtual teams to meet once per year face to face. Managers do not have sufficient funding to hand out meaningful discretionary awards to top performers, and often dip into their own wallets in order to show appreciation.\r\n\r\nArtificial Dead lines are given without regard to available 'resources' aka staff aka PEOPLE- task may require 30 FTEs to accomplish within the deadline handed down from on high, but there are actually only 9 people qualified/experienced to do the task. No regard paid to the toll exacted upon these few: no special bonus or acknowledgement for them when the deadline is met. \r\n\r\nAcquisition & Integration work is handled OVER & ABOVE existing day to day responsibilities. Obviously, zero work-life balance. Because of the bi-annual job elimination cycle, people work to the point that it affects their health out of fear of losing their job in the next round of eliminations. \r\n\r\nForward facing departments seem to have a glut of employees, yet those that actually keep the ship afloat haven't had approval to increase staff in years. Something is wrong...\r\n\r\nIT is mired in process & protocol with multiple sign-offs, bringing no real value. The number and frequency of  these approvals causes the Approver to simply sign-off without review, defeating the purpose. It feels as if the IT process does things just to check off a box. \r\n\r\nSystem enhancements are costly, even with most IT handled off-shore. Again, bringing no value except to the quarterly bottom line: the off-shore IT lack the associated business knowledge to perform robust testing. Some systems now look like a patchwork quilt - but no central document exists to show what it began as and what it has evolved into. Even offshore IT rotate out regularly, netting no continuity of IT system expertise.  Many decisions are punted to the business initiative owner, who may or may not understand the needs of other interfacing systems....\r\n\r\nWith each acquisition, the acquired personnel are assimilated into positions and salary bands above those of the long term aetna employees. Often they are artificially promoted to  Director/VP, having zero knowledge of the particular aetna system/process/or policies - yet the position calls for shaping direction/decision making; net result is they rely heavily upon the existing aetna staff to educate & guide them i.e. existing staff actually does the work, and they rubber stamp it/present to upper management.  \r\n\r\nDecision was made to move phone lines away from land lines to VOIP- despite varying carrier speeds affecting call quality. Voices are unintelligible too often during meetings, affecting productivity. However, no exception process was rolled out - basically it's VOIP or nothing: pay for your own reliable land line to do your job efficiently, or face job elimination."}, {"review_title": "Good PTO and work life balance.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Nov 2017", "job_title": "Clinical Care Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "PTO, WAH, flexible hours, supportive supervisor, matching 401k up to 6%.", "cons": "no room for advancement, very poor compensation - they will demote your current career level without notice, making a salary freeze by doing so.

As employees leave the department they are not replaced (unless they are part of the call center side of the dept), their work load is given to the remaining employees causing them to feel overworked. Senior management is very much focused on a system that tracks \"adherence and idle time\" , instead of focusing on WHY the MAJORITY of the department is failing in the systems eyes. That should be an indicator of the system obviously not tracking properly and the reps not having the NECESSARY tools to achieve the expectations.  Director and Manager are out of the office constantly for days and sadly weeks sometimes, in my opinion managements attendance is just as important as their employees attendance. Management does not have a true grasp of what their employees do and how the work is done. Instead of micromanaging, they need to get their hands dirty and  fix the issues that hold back the department and that is truly one of the biggest CONS of the reimbursement department at Aetna Specialty Pharmacy.\r\n\r\nAlso you are hired under a broad title of \"Claim Benefit Specialist\", this means they move you around as a lateral move when the department needs.
