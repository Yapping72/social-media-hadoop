In fact we lost alot of people during our training because of the call volume. They were right about it being \"back to back\" because you would literally get off one call just take another right after. I think there was one time while I was there, i took 100 calls but that was only because it was holiday and most doctor offices were closed.  What was bad  that you could not even take a break in between calls. I remember being sent  a department email because too many people were taking break between high call volume. Also were were expected to complete off line time work in between calls which was virtually impossible most times as well. The metric system that they expected us to reach was unreasonable and  nearly impossible, As a result, very few people actually received quarterly bonus\"s. \r\n\r\nTime Off- Maybe the rest of the company was different but when it came to the call center, time off was near impossible. You couldn't just put in a day for PTO and have it off. Alot of the time there was a  \"waiting list\" to have certain days off, especially through the months of May and Aug.  If you couldn't get the day off, you would of been forced to just take it off which would you usually result with you getting  what they call an \"occurrence\".  Too many of these (7 in a 12 month period for your first year) would eventually lead to disciplinary action. All I have to say is if your not too sick and you can still come to work, do so.\r\n\r\nHeath Insurance- Don't get me wrong the coverage was great but it was pretty pricey in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAdvancement: I would say that advancement was there but it was extremely difficult.

I work in a site where we had both Aetna and Coventry offices and they combined us into one building. We as Aetna employees were instructed to have a positive attitude and make the Coventry employees feel welcome. I can't speak for everyone, but I certainly have done my part to try and make them feel welcome in this new environment. However, since being moved from an Aetna team to a Coventry managed on I can say that my job has taken a job for the worse. \r\n\r\nPrior to my move I processed claims for our Transplant unit and I loved my job. However, I knew that with our merger with the new company that our specialty units would be taking a hit as far as the number of employees went, so when the opportunity came to take a new position on this new team I jumped at it. Boy did I ever make a huge mistake. \r\n\r\nI sit in an area surrounded by former Coventry employees. There are a few that are very nice, but most of them give my team dirty looks and won't answer back if we try to say hi or good morning. Our new management has a serious chip on their shoulder about being bought out and definately takes it out on us, really enforcing what \"their\" interpretation is of Aetna policy. They've taken away many of the benefits that I've enjoyed in the 6 years that I've worked here as a claims processor, such as a flexible start time and being able to borrow PTO (both of which are still policy in our office, but our new management has chosen not to allow either due to \"business\" needs.) I can no longer plan on a vacation with my family since I'm not able to borrow PTO and this has caused MANY problems and great upset with the rest of my team. Management also acts like we're supposed to stay two seperate companies and not join into one, which goes against everything we've heard from our CEO, Mark Bertolini. \r\n\r\nI had applied to a position as a trainer a year ago and been accepted, but due to the merger the funding for that position was cut and I did not recieve it. Instead the Coventry trainers are going to be merged into our training program, and based on the trainer we had for our conversion class I shudder to think that these people will be represnting our company.  They were only trained in one very specific area of expertise, yet we in our new positions were supposed to be doing everything. Their trainers had to bring in numerous other people to help in training, and every training course we've had since then has been a farce, since those trainers are only focused on one area. \r\n\r\nThe health benefits are a joke.  An insurance company should offer more than two high deductible plans. Even with Aetna putting money into an HSA or HRA you're still paying 100's if not 1000's of dollars out of pocket before Aetna pays anything. I've seen plans by other employers that should really ashame Aetna, since there's no option for a PPO or anything other than a high deductible plan. \r\n\r\nAetna is constantly talking about the culture of the company as well as the Aetna value wheel.  Upper management definately trots both of these out when it suits them, but pushes them to the background when they need to expedite certain issues. We're supposed to focus on collaboration, innovation, mentoring and coaching, accountability, and service to our members. However, you'll find that commitment varies from site to site and even team to team. \r\n\r\nI do find that I have a very good work/life balance, at least I did before I had to change positions. I find that I can leave this job here and not take it home with me at the end of the day. \r\n\r\nThere is also a lot of uncertainty because of the ACA and the Health Exchanges, as well as the numerous layoffs that have just happened in the last week with over 500 people losing their jobs. As much as I've enjoyed working for this company in the past, if things don't improve I will be looking for another job."}, {"review_title": "Great Company, Potential For Bad Work-Life Balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management cares a great deal for it's employees.

The criticism is not constructive. You are simply never good enough. They do a great job breaking you down but never build you back up. They overload you with work and create chaos with requiring licensure in 50 states, but do absolutely nothing to help make the process easier. By the way, none of the sups or mgrs are required to get multistate licensure. This is more than a 40, 50 + hour work week. They take advantage of their employees and drain them emotionally. Many of the sups and mgrs do not have bachelors degrees, let alone a masters. The company right now has a good reimbursement for tuition but the managers, if they know about it, don\u2019t promote it and are against it. They have to sign off on it and make it quite difficult. They make a big deal about numbers and productivity and expect you to meet them but they are ultimately in control of your numbers. It is not a good job if you have a family. Of course almost every nurse that walks in the door  has done the backbreaking work of floor nursing and doesn\u2019t  want to go back to that, and so they hear potential to work from home, and think it\u2019s so great, but by the time they get to the point that they may be able to work from home, they don\u2019t even want to be there and quit! Awful company to work for and now I know why insurance cost so much. Aetna wastes so much time on training and restraining because the turnover is high, and they spend a ridiculous amount of money on multistate licensure that has no baring on the quality of a nurse.

I worked there 7 years and the first 6 were great, with the exception of their health insurance which led me to file bankruptcy.  At this point, I strongly recommend staying far away from Aetna and I never thought I'd say that. It honestly kills me. Advancement is a joke, get a better job within the company and your pay will not increase to reflect it. There are 2 ways to make more money at Aetna. 1. Quit and then go back, lose seniority but potentially higher pay upon returning. Or 2. Say you're going to quit and see if there's a retention offer. You'd think that working hard and keeping your head down would count for something, it absolutely doesn't. \n\nLTD is a mess, with directors (managers new title that Aetna gave them to pay them more, think about that one) have no actual experience doing the job of their subordinates and don't know how much time it takes to process claims. Most DBMs simply push out tasks to appear timely when in fact they are far behind in their work. This is done out of necessity. Scope of job regularly expands to cover other departments functions with no compensation raise. Directors and above will pretend everything is ok when the sustainability of the process and workload is questioned, and will make you feel that you are the problem.  There's talk of raises to actually pay employees at market level however this includes making them exempt. Here's what will happen: pay will increase and then employees will be expected to work tons of OT thus bringing their actual compensation lower than before. \n\nThe insurance is abysmal and a great example of what happens when there's no competition. Hey Aetna, why not pay your employees with vouchers to the company store? I knew several people in financial turmoil due to medical bills. Here was my checklist when considering treatment: am I dying? If not, then just suffer through it because otherwise it was thousands of dollars in medical bills. This is what the insurance company does to their employees and you have Bertolini who acts empathetic because he broke his neck once and had to go through some difficulties. Hey Bert, offering the worst benefits I've ever seen to your employees and not paying them at market level isn't empathetic, your actions do not match your words, sir. \n\nCompensation reviews are a joke. You can be rated 1 - 5. Hope you like the number 3 because rarely is anyone rated above this, guess why. Raises have been around 1%. Employees haven't left because they're too overworked to look around. Do not get mired in this mess. STANDARD EMPLOYEES: Look elsewhere, Aetna is a wolf in sheep's clothing. I promise you. Aetna is doing very well financially and this success is not shared with employees. These are not petty complaints here, all above relates to your financial and physical well-being.
