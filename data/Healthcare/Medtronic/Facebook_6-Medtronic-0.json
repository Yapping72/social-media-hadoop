Managers like to employ people straight from uni or changing careers as only those will work hard for the peanuts that are being offered and can be easily micromanaged.

So-Finance used to be basically in a basement somewhere, and were there to support brilliant engineers and techs build great products. Now-finance and various process groups run the show. The average person spends more time and effort trying to comply with processes, figure out which charge code to use, maintain old systems to be compliant, etc. It is increasingly difficult to hire an actual engineer. Instead, the company continues to build out PMO groups, governance groups, Diversity and Inclusion Groups (I fully support the movement to Inclusion-but it is starting to build its own bureaucracy and increasingly dysfunctional. How many Diversity Directors can you actually employ, and is this actually helping historically disadvantaged groups). If I were a director, I would want to understand how every new hire is going to get products that help customers and make money to market faster. If you can hire that person-do it. If you are building a group that will slow that down? Don't hire for it.
