For example, there was a woman who only had a bachelor's degree in biology, and no directly related work experience, yet she was hired in as a senior financial analyst. Then about every year or two she would be promoted. Whenever they wanted to promote someone who didn't meet the requirements, they would custom create the job position. For example, to be a Principle Financial Analyst you were to have at minimum 7 years of direct experience and a degree in a directly related field like finance or accounting; however they would change the requirement to 2 years and exclude the requirement for needing a related degree.

I was very grateful for the job.\r\n\r\nMedtronic will match donations to the charity of your choice\r\n\r\nThe fitness center has nice equipment and is rarely crowded.", "cons": "When I was hired on at Covidien the benefits were top of the industry. We had unlimited sick leave  which was great for a young family. We also had great United Healthcare benefits, which was terrific for a family . When we found out on a Sunday night that we are getting bought out by Medtronic, most people were excited. I didn\u2019t worry about my job and I thought the benefits would only improve. But the benefits got worse, and the  layoffs are every year since (sometimes twice a year).  To sum up, the medical insurance get worse every year, Medtronic dropped the unlimited sick leave (now you get to take vacation so everyone comes in sick),  and the 401k match dropped.  Medtronic also ruined the cafe. Yes, there are two restaurants on campus and a coffee shop. They really don\u2019t help you at all as the food is terrible and coffee gives me heartburn (seriously). Medtronic fired the former cafe operators and spent a few years going with different vendors. Now they are back with the original vendors but costs must be cut, as the quality of the food under Covidien never returned. Yes, those restaurants are there, but Most don\u2019t eat in them anymore.  Most people bring their lunch to eat at the cafe tables or eat in their office, or their car just to get away from the loud cubicles (that\u2019s something I had never seen before Medtronic, sad people sitting around puffing and eating in their cars). \r\n\r\nThe healthcare is more expensive and far worse, e.g. Blue Cross/Blue Shield wanted me to drive my serverely injured child straight out of the ER 100 miles out of town instead of using a local surgeon. I ended up paying about $4K  out of pocket to stay local ( still to this day it makes me so angry) I tried to appeal the decision twice, even calling Medtronic\u2019s outsourced HR, but got no where....sick or injured kid? Medtronic doesn\u2019t care. This year, the final straw was some sort of \u201cinsurance\u201d out of Minneapolis and it\u2019s pay-as-you-go called Bind. So your choices are BC/BS out of Minneapolis with few local providers or \u201cBind\u201d. Most I know are on their spouses insurance.  You would think all that money Medtronic saved by \u201cmoving\u201d their headquarters to Ireland would be put towards benefits to retain employees, but it\u2019s not.\r\n\r\nOnce I saw how bad the health insurance (and moral) had gotten, I started looking for another job and quickly found one locally. Starting a new company you\u2019re reminded how bad it was at the old. I have better benefits (just used my new vision benefits and saved over $200 more compared to Medtronic ) , better vacation ( the vacation I have now is better than 20 years at Medtronic + sick leave and 2 extra holidays), better 401K match (Medtronic dropped the 6% Covidien match to 3% (with a little extra for company performance) now I have 10%), same salary and work with happier people. \r\n\r\nThe yearly layoffs at Medtronic have taken a toll on employees (every June and sometimes December). The last one they dropped the few dedicated employees they had-you know, the ones that had put in decades and were waiting for retirement...lots of tears that day.  To sum up, those that can get another job do, people who can\u2019t stay with corresponding attitudes (ever see Office Space?). Oh and the severance package is the very least, one week/year.  So, if you are a new employee that moved here to take a job? Good luck, here\u2019s your week ( saw that happen also).\r\n\r\nForget trying to get help with HR or IT that is all outsourced and you\u2019re pretty much on your own. Get used to calling the Phillipines for help with HR (the fun part is asking them your question in a room full of people in cubicle) and Minneapolis for local IT questions. \r\n\r\nIf you are desperate for a job, go ahead and take it at Medtronic. Know that they will drug test you after the offer, and if your drug test comes back positive your offer will be rescinded and everyone you interviewed with will know why.  Gossip is horribly pervasive at Medtronic (I used to find out about upcoming layoffs from the person who served coffee, people would treat her like she was invisible and she would hear it all-she ended up quitting also) and there is no confidentiality (I suspect that left when Medtronic laid off all the local HR reps).  Yes, and they will rescind an offer on testing Marijuana positive. How do I know this? I was told when asked why X hadn\u2019t started, everyone knew. There is no privacy. I should have never known that information, even now it feels wrong. \r\n\r\nMedtronic also has an issue with Charities. You will be required (the company will say you\u2019re not required but your boss may infer you that you are) to help with whichever Christian charities Medtronic decides to bring in. You will spend time during work hours doing whatever job they need you to do, and then have to watch a video about \u201cgod\u201d afterwards, truly...I couldn\u2019t believe it.  You will also have to donate money to whatever right-wing charity Medtronic chooses in order to wear jeans. You boss will receive a list of those who have paid and will reprimand you if you don\u2019t pay to play.  \r\n\r\nIf I were a new graduate looking for a job, my advice to you would be to get an internship at Medtronic. They pay pretty well and the people that take on Interns are generally pretty good (then they get new jobs and leave). Then use that experience to get a job somewhere else. Put your talents to a local company headquartered in the US with better benefits and maybe some stock options (you don\u2019t get that either at Medtronic)  there are plenty around Colorado."}, {"review_title": "Great Company except.......", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Feb 2010", "job_title": "Clinical Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Phenomenal products, Corporate Head Quarters staff professional and knowledgable, great benefits, respected within the medical device industry, excellent new hire training in MN", "cons": "The territory I was hired to cover, number of work hours and required travel changed immediately after being hired.

so to keep the jobs they aren't qualified for, they create this atmosphere of backstabbing and deceit  that I refused to take part in which ensures anyone who they choose to bring into their inner circle first knows their place and second knows what it really takes to get there, not being a great example of work ethic and determination.\r\n\r\nIf you don't think you will eventually quit yourself or get let go over a legally dubious reason, then you are one of the 500+ employees who gets hired on and actually is promoted into that inner circle of control and power (most supervisors and managers are brought in from outside, VERY few employees see any lateral or vertical movement), all the others have a \"famous\" 5+ and 10+ year flags over their desks and have been stuck in that same role their entire career with no end in sight."}], [{"review_title": "Great Company in a transition to overcome short term challenges while also driving necessary earnings improvement", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "12 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Sales Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Intelligent and energetic feel to the company.

If I had a relative or a loved one requiring a cardiac device, I would not hesitate.", "cons": "Throughout the past several years this company has continually reduced the compensation and benefits of it's employees. A few years ago they even cut our modest $45K-$50K base salaries by $6500.00 which were already far below what our competitors were offering their sales representatives. Medtronic did this under the pretense that it was to help cover the 2.3% device industry tax ObamaCare was imposing upon our industry. Yet, they have spent far less money successfully lobbying to delay paying any of this tax. Upper management took the same percentage cut at the time, but underhandedly reinstated their own salaries 6 months later as was referenced in our annual report. Senior leadership is making more money year after year and they are constantly telling us how the company is thriving while the field continues to make less and they neglect to funnel any of the profits back towards the worker bees. We have not even had a cost of living increase in the past 7-8 years, but hey, it's all good because our CEO just had a 79% increase in his compensation over the previous year, earning him over $ 40 million. Also, company employees, some of which dedicated their entire careers to Medtronic, got hit with hefty taxes due to the Medtronic/Covidien merger. Conversely, after less than 5 years of employment with Medtronic, CEO Omar Ishrak was granted an addition $25 million dollars of stock to cover his taxes, along with approximately 20 other executives that unlike employees had their tax burdens covered. I sincerely question how Mr. Ishrak is capable of looking his employees in their faces when he shows up at the National Sales Meeting. This company's leadership clearly does not value it employees and that is sad, because it used to be much different 10+ years ago.\r\nThere is no question that Medtronic has become a huge multinational conglomerate, but it was built off the backs of the CRHF division. The work/life balance of a CRHF representative is horrible, when one considers that as a sales representative, you are on call 24 hours a day Monday-Thursday, every 4th to 5th weekend and most holidays. As a result we should be compensated accordingly for the sacrifices that we are expected to make time and time again by putting work before our families and sometimes our own health, but we are not. I have many friends working at different companies who sell medical devices outside of CRHF and even they feel it is ridiculous that we are not paid MUCH better than they are for the quality of life that we endure.\r\nLastly, in CRHF the training learning curve is so long, that they will not allow you to move to a different division, no matter what management claims. I know many people who have had managers in other divisions openly admit that they had been told they are not allowed to hire from the CRHF division.\r\nI realize that this review contains more negative content than positive and that there are also reviews on this site which are positive. That said, when reading the positive reviews, please take note of the length of employment of the reviewer. Many of the positive reviews are written by newer employees.

For example, even though every employee has a legal right to 20 vacation days per year, if you do not work a full month and leave during the probationary period, you will not have any right to ANY pro rato vacation whatsoever.  \r\n\r\nMy position came with a language bonus that I believed was part and parcel of the base salary.
