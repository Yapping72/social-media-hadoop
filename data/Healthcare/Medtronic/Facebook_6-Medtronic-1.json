I was terminated with zero write ups, an above average review, was not even approached to discuss the allegations for something I didn\u2019t do. I never had even one write up in 20 years of employment prior to this, so that goes to tell you how bad Medtronic it is.\r\n\r\nThe person I replaced was fired for being in the hospital - they called it no call no show! They do not care or respect the American with disabilities act, veterans, or people with medical conditions. They don\u2019t care if you inform them they are violating federal laws because they will not settle out of court and when filing a lawsuit it is still difficult to succeed. I was represented by a very experienced employment attorney and she has had many lawsuits involving Medtronic. In all my previous employers I never even heard of an employment lawsuit but I knew of several immediately after being hired at Medtronic. \r\n\r\nIt is no surprise why they do not attract the best talent.
