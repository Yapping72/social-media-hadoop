Would say this is a good place to start your career.", "cons": "The culture at Medtronic (specifically Diabetes division in Northridge, CA) is very toxic. There is high turnover for most departments and the roles are typically replaced with contractors. Many of the middle management care nothing about the employees and will throw you under the bus. People are constantly going out on leave and not coming back. The burnout and stress is real. I have literal nightmares about working here. It has a good old boys club culture. Avoid at all costs. \r\n\r\nI have worked at Medtronic for over 8 years and have had many managers during that time. They have gotten progressively worse as time has gone on. Management tends to bring in their friends from former companies rather than promoting within or converting contractors to FTE roles. Upper management is constantly changing which is part of the problem. There is constant restructuring. \r\n\r\nThere is little recognition for working nights and weekends which is expected for most people. Managers make promises on promotions and don't deliver, even after you pull miracles. Complaints to HR about unethical and toxic culture go unheard. \r\n\r\nI was promoted into a management role and given zero training despite having no experience. I had a manager above me who was a toxic micromanager. This manager made the entire team miserable. The manager was sexist and told me on several occasions that team members should choose between their career and their families. Again, complaints to HR did nothing to resolve this. That manager is still there today making the whole team miserable. Complaining equates to causing drama. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for any type of work/life balance, do not work for Medtronic Diabetes. They will not deliver. \r\n\r\nThe benefits get worse each year. They never give good raises and 401(k) match is never what you are led to believe. The goals for the year become more and more ridiculous and unachievable each year. \r\n\r\nThe company throws more work at you each year as they progressively add new projects to your plate. There is no extra benefit, just more work. I have witnessed many people miss deadlines and get yelled at. Most of the time deadlines are missed because of poor project planning. This delays the employees at the end of the process and these poor people are often not given extensions on their timelines."}, {"review_title": "Worst Culture & Biased company", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Senior Systems Administrator in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nothing, they ruin your life.
