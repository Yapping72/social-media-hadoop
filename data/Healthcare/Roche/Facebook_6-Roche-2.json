In the past 6 years, my job was impacted 4-5 times.   I had to either apply for a new job or take a package and leave.  All of these were due to OPEX realignment of personnel.  Senior management would move head count from one location to another without always understanding what they were doing.

The Nutley location was closed down after 100 years of service and the US headquarters shifted to Genentech.    \r\n\r\nThe merger of Roche and Genentech has not been the smoothest.

Gene is agile and flexible with the mentality of \"get the work done as quick as possible.\"  They don't let cost act as barrier necessarily.

Weekly meeting(s) are masqueraded as somewhere to share data and information across groups, but actually function as arenas where groups face off against each other vying for power and recognition.

Fear, competition, and mistrust permeate the entire organization.\r\n- Lack of concrete direction and strategy from executive and senior management leads to entire site scrambling for goals and direction every year.\r\n- \"Innovate Now\" and \"Speak Up\" are two of the cultural beliefs, but almost no one is allowed to do anything innovative or out of the box.  Anything that bucks the status quo is immediately met with resistance.  \"We already tried that and it didn't work\", and then not having any data to back up claims seems to be the default response.  People catch on quickly, stop trying to contribute new ideas, turn on \"coast mode\", and become \"yes\" men or women.\r\n- Salaries are consistently below what other companies Pharma, Biotech, or Technology companies in the Bay Area are offering even though HR claims they are performing salary comparisons.  People leaving for new opportunities regularly secure 30-40% compensation increases.  Stock options are only offered to a select group of software engineers, data scientists or directors and above, good luck everyone else!\r\n- Contractors are treated like second-hand citizens, and I have seen many cut loose before their contracts are up.  I even witnessed one case where the contractor was given only 4 days of notice before being told they were being let go.\r\n- Points above lead to a large number of disengaged workers that are trapped and looking for a way out.
