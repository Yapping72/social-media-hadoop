Actually, each division was acquired by J&J and was integrated into J&J family of companies, thus they all still have some of their own identity left. \r\n\r\nJ&J more and more (at my experience) hires from outside instead promoting within. When it does, it tends to hire over-qualified people. If you are already a director, they offer you a manager title, even though the pay might be higher.  But this creates a signal that people within will never get next level job (you should be a director first before you can get a manager title)\r\n\r\nJob pressure and stress can be high and some may not take it well."}, {"review_title": "Best company to work with", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "14 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Manager Planning in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture, employee friendly, paternity leaves", "cons": "Nothing to add.

Long-term incentive plan is realistic and will remain in place: percentage of base salary in Restricted Stock Units that mature in 3 years - that is, you take approx 20% of your base salary divide it by the trailing 30-day average stock price to arrive at a number of SHARES of stock, not stock options. Take this year's number of shares of J&J stock and you can sell them in 3 years - that is a rolling plan of stock ownership until you retire - that's better than a pension plan if you take your long-term incentive money and invest it conservatively instead of spending it.

Johnson and Johnson is also over a billion dollar company, when the recession was real bad one of the first cuts they made was saying Co-ops could no longer be paid for overtime hours. For a college student $19/hr is a handsome fee, especially when every single week you're working about 50 hours and those 10 hours are time and a half. Making $19/hr was no where near what entry level employees make, we were paid less than anybody and we got overtime taken away. Any hour over 40 would not be compensated at all. At the end of the 7 month co-op there were over 10 seniors in college working there, not a single one was offered an interview. I was not a senior at the time. These people worked so hard, stayed overtime when they weren't being paid even though we all took night classes and didn't even get an interview.

As it is a service center, they expect to pay you extremely low Czech wages, not even near US or Swiss office salaries. Somehow the jaded workers at J&J think the current salaries are amazing. Trust me, they are terrible. With rising rents in the city and prices of food and or leisure activities rising, for the amount of stress and work you have to do for the company is not properly compensated for. Advice would be to get experience, get it on your CV and go somewhere else that has some realistic salaries and a realistic workload to actually enjoy life. Prague has extremely low unemployment rates. Do not be afraid! That 2-3% raise yearly? Roughly (900) Czech more. Nothing to get excited about.

As listed in Pros, J&J IRDP is great in many ways but has lots of issues in the long term. IRDP is a global initiative where they encourage local subsidiaries to hire MBAs. J&J has few MBAs internally so they need to hire MBAs to make J&J look good in annual reports. However, J&J is a sales driven company and almost all senior managers in local subsidiaries started as medical sales reps and then made their way up. Some of them don't even have college degrees but have decades of J&J experience. These old timers don't believe in this whole IRDP practice and IRDPs are always seen as outsiders within their organizations. When MBAs are hired, there is almost always no mention of necessity of sales experience but in couple of years, they are asked to work as a sales rep and then make their way up like reps. It is like J&J saying that your MBA and great work experience means nothing to us and you will have to start in sales from the same level as some nurse who just moved into medical sales. Sales experience is important but it can be given in short assignments instead of expecting MBAs to spend 3-4 years in field sales. Most IRDPs leave the organization at this stage (between 2 to 3 years of joining the company) and it is very rare for an IRDP to make it to general management. In my organization, only one guy made it to a GM from over 80 IRDPs hired in 10 years time-frame.\r\n\r\nJ&J is a great company to work for if you intend to work there for life. Great benefits and good culture but certainly not for MBAs. If you want to take life easy, work for J&J and lifetime employment is guaranteed even if worked 10% of your MBA potential but expect to spend 10 years as a Product Manager and then a few years in sales before you move into senior roles."}, {"review_title": "ITLDP Associate", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Apr 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The employees/leadership (known as the 'program team') governing the Information Technology Leadership Development Program (ITLDP) are, for the most part, great people who tried helping entry level employees with getting a proper fit for roles within different sectors of J&J.
