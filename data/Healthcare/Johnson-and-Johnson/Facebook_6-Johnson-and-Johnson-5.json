I am very proud to have worked with J&J, but I'm disappointed in their current direction.  J&J has moved away from its decentralized model, and they've done a poor job of promoting/retaining their best people.  \r\n\r\nMy initial experience was excellent.  We were acquired by J&J.  They left us alone, and they provided the finanical capacity for us to make some investments that we could not have accomplished on our own.  Then growth slowed at other J&J companies, and J&J began to restructure.  Longtime J&J employees began getting hired at our company.  In fact, our management was told that they needed to find positions for many of them.  The old J&J people then brought their friends with them.  The problem with this is that the J&J people didn't understand our business.  The decision making process became over-complicated and confusing.  One external consultant warned our team that J&J paralyzes itself with analysis.  \r\n\r\nJ&J became a very tough place to work.  New jobs were posted that weren't really available... they had already been promised to someone else.  The J&J people in managment filled their teams with people they knew regardless of whether the person was competent for the position.  I asked one of my peers (a longtime J&J guy) why he hired one of his district managers.  I had interviewed her (at the request of the national sales director) and I found her to be incompetent.  I didn't know him very well but he said she would do a great job.  She was a disaster and so was he.  They both finished dead last in the national sales standings, and the morale on their teams was completely destroyed.  Despite how terrible she was, they promoted her back in house.  Her boss blamed the sales team.  I knew several members of the sales team... they were not the problem.  Even the district manager's former sales colleagues said they knew she would be a disaster.  Both she and her former boss are still with J&J.  There is no accountability.\r\n\r\nI was truly sad to leave the company.  J&J has some truly outstanding products.  It is a leader in healthcare, and they are very supportive of their communities.  However, they've protected bad subsidiary managers for too long, and these people have surrounded themselves with equally bad people.\r\n\r\nBefore I left, I tried an experiment.  I stopped doing any work, and I just spent my time in meetings and networking.  To my surprise, I was offered several new jobs.  I wasn't even qualified for one of them, but the VP wanted someone he knew.  I will admit it was tempting, but I couldn't do it.\r\n\r\nI'm told J&J monitors these boards, so I'm sure they'll put a black mark on my HR file for writing this.  I truly hope the company changes.  I'm very proud of my time there.  I wish I could have made a career in the company, but the culture is decaying and they show no willingness to change it."}, {"review_title": "Great company to work for, but challenging times ahead", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "24 Sept 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great products that help patients around the world every day, as an employer great variety of challenges and opportunities to work on", "cons": "Big large company resulting in a lot of complexity to deal with.

When the inner circle decides that they don't like you, they will find a way to get rid of you.\r\n\r\nNot Organized: This group is in its awkward teenage years of development, so there are not a lot of established procedures and processes.  There is a lot of hurry up and wait with projects.   Some work can feel like busy work, and it is not clear what the outcome is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nNepotism:  Most people in the office are connected with their co-workers in some way (friends, old classmates, neighbors, etc.).  If you are not it the inner circle, you may be treated differently.  Upper management is an extreme example of this.\r\n\r\nNot Collaborative:  The office is fairly siloed, there is not a lot of time and opportunity to find out what your coworkers are working on or to help them or have them help you.\r\n\r\nCreativity is not valued as much as you would expect:\r\nAlthough J&J Design is an internal design consultancy for all of J&J they are set up more like a production house (they crank out a bunch of work) as opposed to a consultancy which is involved in more strategic work.   So the focus is on cranking out work quickly rather than creativity and strategic thought.  The IXS (Insights and User Experience) Team may be an exception to this rule.  \r\n\r\nNot that Friendly:  It took about six months for most of my coworkers to warm up to me.

Strong balance sheet.", "cons": "Experiences will vary signficantly from location to location as the company is a group of some 200 + operating entities operating under 3 divisions. Gold plated balance sheet and tripple A rated bonds means the company is unlikely to encounter major financial troubles in the short to medium term. I would have no reservations purchasing their short or intermediated term bonds or even stock (pays good divident) but as a company to work for it is a totally diffrent matter. They pay well above market because they have to to keep people. Work environment is very high pressure for techical people because these departments are controlled by Marketing and they do not understand what it takes to organically develop a culture of techical innovation and growth. Impossibly short time lines for product design and testing are the norm and if there is a slip, jobs are at risk. Employees there understand this so they will cut corners and find creative ways to rationalize poor technical plans and decisions to meet time like. This is fundamentally a marketing controlled company with their biggest asset being their brand. I predict in the next 10 years, this company will become more of a brand label like Westinghouse or RCA, where their power comes from licensing the brand to other less known names. There is very little I saw internally that leads me to believe in organic internal growth. Acquisitons and divestures are an every day event with layoffs happening nearly all the time. The department I worked in, people were routinely getting sick with ulcers and other GI troubles due to work stress.  Management has a very snoby attitude to employees. It is do as they tell you now or you will be out in the next round of layoffs which seems to always be less than 1 year away. There is a strong push to promote women into management and I have seen many who are technically incompentant promoted into such roles as bosses over male employees.
