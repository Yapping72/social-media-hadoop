The daily sexism is so pervasive that it\u2019s just a normal part of life at JnJ. Senior leadership is a boys club that openly throws around inappropriate comments and won\u2019t think twice about escorting female colleagues by placing a hand on the small of her back. It is even worse for LGBT+ employees who, despite all the corporate newsletters on diversity and inclusion, live in fear of being outed to leadership. Many folks who are out in their personal lives assume a heteronormative persona in the office under the strict, unspoken \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy of senior leaders for fear of being passed up for advancement. Attempting to take your concerns to HR will do nothing but put a target on your back. The senior leadership not only turns a blind eye, but actively rewards this toxic behavior in managers.
