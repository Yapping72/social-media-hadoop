Coming from smaller and medium sized biotechs in the past.  I thought I had hit the jackpot with securing a position with Illumina.  One of the largest and fastest growing companies in San Diego.  Well, the grass is not always greener on the other side.  It was the worst sales position and career move that I had chosen.  My biotech lab and sales career has been long and really rewarding.  Being in sales, I am a people person.  I can relate to a very wide demographic of people.  Yet, Illumina's company, culture and vibe was just a disconnect for me.  It never really felt like a community or even welcoming to me.  All the other companies that I worked for, there was transparency and cross departmental collaboration.  At Illumina, it was like pulling teeth to get any assistance from marketing, product managers, technical support, customer service, fulfillment, and logistics.  Nobody ever wanted to help each other.  Each department seemed to be against each other.  Never felt a collaborative effort.  It was a very self serving or self preservation type of company culture.  I guess it is understandable when I saw some colleagues fired out of the blue.  If you see something like that, you probably want to keep very busy and your head down.  As many other reviews here, I would have to agree that upper management has a deficiency in leading and growing this company.  \r\n\r\nThe sales teams were made mostly from people that have no science or biotech experience at all.  How can your front line representatives sell an instrument when they have never worked in a lab or have zero understanding of the up or downstream processes that the instrument is going to fit into.  There was one week of training but it was more like them turning on a fire hose.  Trying to cram everything into one week.  Online self training was also idiotic.

Because of that, it becomes nearly impossible to gain the support (air cover) of a manager as you try to navigate the company's idiosyncrasies and actually to get things done for the greater good. Those that do well here realize that the company is in constant flux and will start to \"chart their own course\" by managing upwards and creating their next opportunity as a way to be proactive when the musical chairs move again.

Some of the pros for me include:\r\n\r\n- Growth opportunity - We are scaling at a fast pace which provides various opportunities to grow whether that be vertical or horizontal\r\n- People - Since I spend more time at work than I do with my family, the people I interact with on a daily basis is very important to me.  At Illumina, you will find very dedicated and passionate people.  You will not find the hero mentality here.  We succeed as a team and fail as a team.  It is an extremely collaborative and open environment where people are truly passionate about everyone succeeding and Illumina realizing its mission.  \r\n- Benefits - We are setting the bar in terms of the type of benefits we provide our employees.  As an example, we provide the innovative benefits around issues related to undiagnosed disease and cancer through our genome access program.   We also offer amazing benefits related to reproductive health.\r\nEquity: Most of the positions are equity eligible at Illumina.  This allows employees to have company ownership and be directly rewarded for impacts they made to the company.  As we continue to innovate and launch new products, our stock continues to grow and this provides more income to our employees.  \r\nMission: There are a lot of great companies people can choose to work for but the mission at Illumina is in my opinion one of the most powerful.   Having children and knowing that my efforts will provide them a better life in the future is extremely rewarding for me.   \r\nPace of Change: People at Illumina always talk about the fast pace.

This includes firing me for completing a project that when she gave it to me she openly stated she did not know how to do it or where to get the information.  There was not any recourse or even any warning I was about to be fired.  No one looked at what she did.  She was just allowed to act as a spoiled child.      \r\n\r\nI was under a woman who was in over her head.  I was hired as a contractor to take some of the workload off her.  I have extensive experience in this area so it did not seem to be a problem to me.  It soon became clear she did not understand her job and was going to lash out at anyone who was a threat to her, i.e. know how to do the job.  She got to the point where she spent many late night hours (seen on the emails) finding completely ridiculous, petty things for me to change on my work. I made the changes for her without saying a word.     \r\n\r\nUpon completion I offered to walk her through the project she had told me she did not know how to do.  Since it was complex and contained a lot of information it is not easy for anyone to follow.  She immediately accused me of insufficient documentation and refused to listen to anything I had to say.  In 2 days I had 5 different versions of the spreadsheet from her.  She was not even looking at the most recent version I had which was available to her at any time. Clearly she was more interested in picking at it.\r\n\r\nSince she refused to accept that I knew anything, she got the person who did the project last year to review mine.  She kept insisting last year was \"easy\" to understand and very consistent so I should just do it like it was done last year.  On several occasions I tried to explain to her why this did not work.   She was unable to discuss any of it.  They, my supervisor and the person who did the project last year, decided to limit me to certain screen shots on the software because they did not know what many of mine were and did not bother to ask or read the explanations/documentation.   When they decided to gang up on me for 2+ hours to \"show me how to do it\", the numbers did not work in the formula they required me to use!  We all sat there and saw it.  I was then told to use an alternate method and just explain to the auditors what I did when the formula did not fit the back up.  Clearly their numbers and \"consistent/easy to understand\" system did not work.  I was about to find out I was going to be held responsible for last year's work being less than consistant.\r\n\r\nI went in the next day and began to work on other samples of this test.  I believed I had found a way to give her something she could understand as well as make the numbers work as I needed them to do with the formula they required me to use.   I will not give numbers that do not work.  If the incorrect numbers/documentation were discovered I would clearly and rightfully be responsible for unacceptable work.  She did not speak to me the next day.  How childish can you be?  I worked all day coming up with the new system and combining all the spreadsheet versions she had created.  Sat, the next day I received a call from the recruiter saying they claimed I could not take constructive criticism and was fired.  No one in the dept. did anything. It seems she was not required to ask anyone before firing me and/or no one thought it reasonable to ask me what was happening or look at my work.   Why interview me when you are going to let her be the immature and incompetent person she is and take it out on whoever you all hired?

People are looking to move up by playing the blame game and taking credit for other peoples work. Young engineers are sold a dream but are not aware of how their work fits into the whole scheme of things. This mafia mentality is leading to a lot of high performers wanting to change groups or quit the company.

Finance cost centers are poorly set up. Even managers and ADs do not have control over their finances\r\n6. Hiring for the sake of headcount accumulation is rampant.

As a result, the more I learned and developed my skills, the more I fell into the trap of what is now known as the horrible company company politics that plague this organization.  This company does not praise innovation nor does it appreciate any attempts at process improvements.  Blatant politics aside, the reason for this is mostly because process improvements will point out many reduncies that are in the form of a heavy management structure and outdated procedures, and trust me they have a lot to lose by having this pointed out.\r\n\r\nMiddle-management in my experience proved to be very hyper-political, extremely incompetent, unreasonably demanding, antagonistic, and blame-oriented.  It was worse in the overseas offices, with very notable HR issues with management that any normal publicly traded company would fix right away. Company goes so far as to drive out unwanted \u201coutsiders\u201d in very unethical ways with methods not at all based on evaulating an employee's performance.  This was reported to upper management but with no avail.  So much for the official \u201copenness\u201d policy, as me being open to management about these kinds of happenings with me and my team led to worse treatment and no guidance or accountability on their part.  \r\n\r\nOverall and globally I will never give Illumina a good endorsement as a place to work and wouldn\u2019t even wish that environment to someone I disliked, as this place was intolerable and torture to work in.  I personally had commendations on my record and received extra compensation only in the form of the occasional \u201catta boy,\u201d at the cost of sacrificing my personal life and time at all hours of the day/night/weekend/holidays.  More often then not, I was very rudely and unprofessionally treated.  Communications in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS and bolded DEMANDING why you did not deliver \u201cx\u201d item yet are the norm here\u2026never mind keeping people in the loop, being short on resources, working 12+ hour days, being stretched too thin, as that does not matter here to the antagonistic management and sales groups.  Company saves money in the form of keeping a lean staff, yet throws over the top parties at headquarters, pays tens of millions to a very un-involved and ethically bankrupt upper management team.  Let\u2019s not forget the huge margins on the products and services, as that is no secret.  Anything other than a \"yessa yessa\" at all hours of the day and or night  (literally I would get calls in the middle of the night) will get you in hot water.\r\n\r\nTo put it in perspective for any future prospective bright eyed and bushy tailed workers who are considering Illumina as a place to work: You will see process improvement, resource allocation, reward/incentives for good work and overall respect for employees about as often as you would see a unicorn.  Stay away because despite the fact that this place experienced fast growth, the greed and lack of professional leadership of the organization is what is shining through now internally and externally, and it vastly overshadows its previous \u201cpioneering\u201d reputation.  \r\n\r\nTurnover rate is the highest I have ever seen in my career.
