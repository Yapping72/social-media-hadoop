But, once you are onboarded you soon realize that your job is primarily composed of two things: \r\n1) being a labeling technician or coordinator who manually implements labeling for multiple products for all countries and all languages. That's right! They will have you vouch for labeling in languages that you don't know. To add to your misery, all Abbott Vascular products are from the jurassic period, so they are already registered in hundreds of countries. Now, your job is to manually ensure that you post the right IFU version in the right language(s) for all the right countries.  So that's X products x say 267 countries... you do the misery math. Even though this is your primary job function, management refuses to add it to the job description or disclose it during the interview process. \r\n2) being a glorified assistant who performs printing, scanning, notarizing, stamping, and shipping of documents for global regulatory requests. This is basically a high school interns job, but at Abbott Vascular.. this is performed by the regulatory specialists and project managers. Again, they conveniently keep forgetting to disclose this during the interview.\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITIES- If you are able to adequately suck up to management by taking on event planning & travel scheduling tasks and staying for several years (because maybe you are on a work visa?), then you may get to put your name on an actual regulatory submission. However, you will not be authoring the submission. LOL. Management will ask you to send the submission template to the engineers for doing the regulatory writing. So you will basically learn no useful skills for your next job. \r\n\r\nCULTURE: the toxicity is as contagious as COVID-19. Oh, and by the way Abbott wouldn't let us Work From Home during a pandemic and a national emergency caused by this coronavirus. \r\nThe 3 pillars of toxicity include:\r\n- Unprofessional conduct: the long time Abbott employees seem to have no training in regard to proper conduct at work.\r\n- \"clicks\" based on ethnicity: If you are a white man here... phew! good luck!...unless you can join our bollywood dance troop at work? In other words, the diversity in RA is embarrassing. \r\n- Work visas: what better way to have a hostage work force that will keep its heads down for the sake of maintaining their visa status? Also, why is our government giving skilled worker visas to do an admin's job?"}, {"review_title": "Great opportunitiy for growth", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Apr 2011", "job_title": " in Santa Clara, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People are great to work with and are very bright.

Political Games. \r\n\r\nThis company's motto may as well be, \"Why pay for the cow when you can get the milk for free?\" I am lucky I left when I did. I was in an area of the company that was significantly high stress, especially when the split of Abbott/AbbVie was announced. Many of us had to support divestiture activities not just up to the split, but then afterwards when we were obligated to service BOTH companies for a period of two years. Essentially, we did the work for two companies (when we were already doing the jobs of three people each before this), but god forbid we get any financial compensation for it. Management never wanted to hear any real talk about how things were going. Any attempts at constructive criticism were met with blank stares or hostility. This company does not reward the employees that do the day to day work that is crucial to the company's survival. I fought for two years to get a promotion based on all the new work I was doing and skills I had learned. Former co-workers of mine have been told the company either \"can't afford\" to promote them or \"so and so got a promotion last year so you'll just have to wait\" ( a quota system?!)  which is obscene especially since I know one of my former co-workers has taken on a completely different job with more responsibilities which was not the job they were hired into. (Thus the free milk and don't pay for the cow comment.) My former direct supervisor was excellent and very knowledgeable, and should have been promoted when the split happened but wasn't for political reasons. (Basically the person is not inclined to blow sunshine up peoples' rear ends.) Instead an outsider was brought in who very quickly demonstrated they were all talk. I gave the benefit of the doubt to this person for a while, and then was quickly disillusioned. This person can't do anything without first running it by my former supervisor because after a year, still doesn't know anything. Now I hear this person comes in late and leaves early and is a ghost when my old supervisor is away. Also after the split, a re-org happened and a new divisional head was assigned to whom you could not display anything but a smiling face. Again, constructive criticism and talk of how things might be improved was discouraged. Horrible favoritism as well. My group was penalized for no reason whatsoever and any thing that made work bearable (like telecommuting) was taken away. Yet the new head's favorites were allowed to continue telecommuting. Abbott is a behemoth that still actively resists change, no matter how much they talk it up. For god's sake, it took until 2013 to get off Lotus Notes and onto Outlook. Layoffs are unsurprisingly happening now, which was to be expected at some point post-split. It's yet another reason why people suffer in silence - they're afraid of losing their jobs. And don't even get me started on how this company bullies employees during the annual giving campaign to donate just so the company can get good PR. Abbott used to be a well-respected company in the area, and I grew up in the area thinking it was prestigious. After seeing how many incompetent people work there, sitting around and collecting a check, I know better. Abbott continues to act as if they don't need to pony up salary wise to attract top talent because of their brand name. Sorry, but saying \"I work at Abbott\" (insert jazz hands) doesn't magically make your bills disappear. With a lot of companies moving their tech and business analysts to the city to attract younger talent, I think Abbott is going to find out the hard way that their old view of employees is going to flop.

Although money incentives were nice, saying \"good job\" every once in awhile would have been great too.  I've never felt more degraded and put down in my entire life as in my yearly reviews and one on ones.  Everyone in the company puts on an extremely \"fake\" hat on and pretends they love their job when most of them are absolutely miserable.

No training, no development, sucky management. If the managers like you then your life at work is great, if they don't then you have horrible experience like I did. Favorism is a huge part of management at Abbott - all across the board. Very resistant to any changes, lots of bitter old women that don't like to incorporate any changes, and ideas you have get shot down, they don't even want to listen to suggestions. Comments like \"Check your stupidity\" are on daily bases. The company is going thru restructuring after spin off and people are scared for their jobs. Morale is very low, no motivation, you just go there to work and that's it. You sit in the cube most of the day with very little interaction with others. My team had deadlines that would never be met because management kept extending them and during reviews they would blame analysts for not meeting deadlines. Their monthly close is 11 workdays which is extremely long. People say Abbott is a great place to work for, but I've been there for 16 months and I hated it since day one because of management. I've worked with a woman that was there for 23 years and didn't want to share knowledge and every time I asked her to explain something to me she pretended she didn't understand what I was talking about and always answered \"I'm not sure, I don't know the answer to that\". There are only few good divisions at Abbott that people enjoy working for like Nutrition but corporate finance is not one of them. My manager was so unprofessional and very fake which is a normality at Abbott. She would always talk badly about other employees in front of her group. You never hear \"Great Job\" and there is a lack of encouragement to do better. I got goals for year 2012 during my review in 2013 which was a joke.

If you post a position for 'Plant Manager', 'Manufacturing Engineer', 'Manufacturing Engineering Manager' or any of the positions which have been filed through sponsorship, you will get dozens of applications of qualified medical device professionals. The upper management of the facility prefer to hire their own people from Ireland because it improves their own position in the company.

Many employees had recently left other positions to come to Abbott only to show up to their new job and receive a 10% pay cut within a month or 2 and be told that they would have to be into work at 5am. The reason employees were told that 2nd shift was being cut was due to demand, yet no layoff occurred, only a shift of employees to 1st shift and almost no attrition.\r\n\r\nWithin 6 months, management decided that they had made a mistake and reopened the 2nd shift saying that there had been an increase in demand, again disrupting the lives of all of its employees for reasons that provided no benefit to the company.
