The manager was socially challenged. Very rude and arrogant, He lost about 85% of his staff in less than 2 years. This causes major disruption for people... people change cities, buy houses, etc. to start a new job, and then this creep tries to chase them out of the job. I'm sure he doesn't care though, since he's such a jerk, and only cares about himself.  You'd think that HR would intervene, but apparently not... maybe because they're too busy backfilling all people who can't stand to work here. The manager chases out all the people with good personalities, and the only people left form a toxic work environment. The people left over steal credit for other people's work, gloat about how many hours they're working, constant CYA from everyone, throwing everyone else under the bus... The manager has a toxic personality, so he keeps all the toxic people and pushes out all the people with good personalities. Promotions are unfair and completely arbitrary. You will NOT be rewarded for hard work at this company. There are no incentives to do well. If you make the mistake of joining this company, you may as well do the bare minimum and get out as soon as you can.
