Full-time workers are a little bit more lenient on errors and at least given warnings. If your temp you're almost treated like trash.  A 3rd party which is HR handles your terminations. You have no way of explaining yourself. Even if they provide reasoning you have no way of speaking out to explain yourself based on work performance.

It was incredibly easy to be supportive of my manager and to try and make them look good, because the managers make sure to give credit where credit is due, and ultimately they have the best interests of the company in their mind, not petty personal stuff. \r\n- this depends on the individual manager and the individual situation but generally managers work with employees to have flexible schedules for people with kids, people who need to go to the doctor, etc.  Work from home, provided it is not abused, is usually on the table.\r\n- Pay was about what it should be.\r\n- Very ethical company.  Management is always looking to do the right thing.  Every day I left work, I felt that we were doing the right thing.\r\n- Quality is important.

Might be PTSD from other divisions.  the constant state of fear of being the next to be laid off starts to mess with your brain after awhile.

Most of the people have been in the same job function for 10+ years.  This is partially due to the gridlock, in that nobody moves up.  Whenever someone leaves, they either don't replace the headcount at all, or the replacement takes so long, they may as well have not replaced the headcount at all.

Would have even taken a pay CUT if it meant I could stop the contingent worker cycle of pain, where every six months your contract needs to be actively extended or you are gone.  Even if you are well regarded and can get continuous extensions, once you hit two years by their agreement with Tapfin, your employment contract gets severed, and you cannot be re-employed as a contract worker for 30 days.

Abbott's health plan choices are surprisingly poor.    For a health care company, I was surprised to find how poor our choices were, and how little coverage Abbott provides.

However, if you experience even minor non-routine medical needs, be prepared to pay a lot out of pocket.   \r\n\r\nIf you are job seeker, and contemplating a job offer from Abbott, I would highly recommend doing through research into the health plans, health network (not very many choices), the weekly payroll deductions, and the out-of-pocket charges you will incur for health coverage before taking the job.   While health insurance should be one of many factors in considering a job, I advise you to concentrate on this benefit with Abbott.   I have been pleased with all the other Abbott benefits, but I am still surprised how little Abbott provides, when compared to other companies, across many industries.    I've been pleased with my career here, but due to Abbott's poor health plan, poor network, and significant expenses due to the low coverage on the plans - I have began a job search.  I find that I can no longer work for a company that provides cut-rate health insurance, with few options for its employees.\r\n\r\nThe quality management system at Abbott is crushing to development, innovation, and timely execution.   Of course, everyone expects high quality products, every time - and I believe this is a must.   However, the way Abbott has set up its quality system adds unnecessary time to every step of development.   Be prepared to take 1 step forward, and 2 steps back when trying to come up with improvement.   When trying to get approval, quality managers will simply say \"No\", without providing a \"why\" or provide feedback on how or where to improve.   The quality system here seems to feed on itself, simply creating more jobs, more bureaucracy, more expense - but not improving the process in any manner.

They think that if even one copier anywhere on the entire campus works, then there isn't a problem. This is only a problem for the worker bees as upper management have their own printers and administrators.\r\n* When AbbVie and Abbott split, the IT infrastructure was upgraded (with some of the legacy software being 40 years old!).  But Abbott went cheap- buying the oldest possible version of software and not paying for support, maintenance, or upgrades.  It's bare bone city.   Oh, and they still have some systems, like vacation tracker, on the very old Lotus Notes!\r\n* The cafeteria food is so gross that my dog won't eat my leftover sandwich meat.\r\n* Cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired. The carpet is vacuumed and the floors mopped weekly but refrigerators, desktops, filing cabinets, etc are never cleaned or dusted. Many employees bring spray disinfectant to work to clean their phones, door handles, copiers, etc. as Abbott would never consider paying for that.\r\n\r\nThe general counsel must be a real witch as attorney turnover is very high.  I never work with the same attorney over the course of a project.\r\n\r\nThe only \"clubs\" allowed are for Blacks, Latinos, Asian, gay, or Sweet Talkers (public speaking).

Chicago is very disconnected from the reality in the field. You will not get to ever see the CEO - he\u2019s very well ranked externally but is not an inspirational or culture driven leader.  No clear sense on the Company\u2019s vision for the future or the culture the company is looking to build. Very old school in his thinking. He\u2019s due for retirement, although his successor\u2019s leadership and abilities are yet to be put to the test and there\u2019s not a lot of confidence he\u2019ll drive a positive change in culture. Company highly oriented to financial/business results, which has produced a long standing reputation and high yield in its stock price. However, with the lack of communication related to the vision, lack of culture strategy, and extremely poor integration work with the new companies, the question is how long will these good returns continue. Leadership in certain divisions move (or are moved) at such a high pace so constant change in strategy and direction confuses people and has driven turnover in some areas. \r\n\r\n2.Infraestructure: Organization is very top heavy, bureaucratic, and slow to move, with limited resources to support the everyday work. Outdated and non connected systems make the most simple data requests a challenge and are highly people dependent - each employee defines the way to manage processes, creating lots of variability and inefficiencies. Constant last minute fires requiring data validation generating big administrative burden. Lack of clarity related to how to measure goals and metrics resulting in constant re-do of analysis and differences in how divisions measure results.\r\n\r\n3. Human Resources: Lack of strong HR leadership or strategy. Very old school as well and stuck in the old way of doing HR. Employee benefits can vary by division and legacy teams from integrated companies do not get the same pay as benefits as Abbott employees (ex. Bonus targets or pension) causing big tension and dissatisfaction as they make less money than Abbott employees. Force ranking performance system does not foster collaboration nor is it objective because goales do not tend to be very well aligned at the beginning of the year, so ends up driving loss of morale. No employee surveys or culture initiatives. Lack of listening to employee opinions or how it impacts morale. \r\n\r\n4. Workforce: Highly tenured workforce, not the best place for millenial and early talent. Many long standing Abbott employees who have not moved with the changes in direction, remain in their roles due to grandfathered pension benefits and high pay, generate loss of productivity, increase in workload for other newer team members and high dismotivation. Some of them block good talent to be promoted.\r\n\r\n5. Offices: Many old buildings and facilities across the affiliates. Your experience will highly depend on where you end up located. Capital investment is managed tightly so expect to work in old outdated buildings with a decor that was stuck in the 80\u2019s or early 90\u2019s not very inspiring."}, {"review_title": "Billion dollar start up, with potential.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Apr 2009", "job_title": "Project Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great products and people, they are really trying.", "cons": "A bit disorganized and somewhat unprofessional.
