The company has a grading system, each employee has a grading from 10 to maybe 40... no one knows much about the grades (except our own) plus some hearsay. The truth is the grading in this company is based on the revenue size of the business division you are in and not based on loyalty, contribution, ownership, attitude, efforts, etc . its also not determine by your immediate supervisors or your management but by someone far away in either India or US. So to be promoted to the next grade, you need luck to... 1) to be in a divison that happens to make a certain revenue 2) have supportive management who have a network of other management (ether in HR, or someone with some power) to help sell your promotion to the committee 3) and pray that the committee is in a good mood when they review your case"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Technician in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to work in.", "cons": "Shift and need to ot"}, {"review_title": "Life to the fullest", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strong talent development culture\nStrong financials", "cons": "Loads of review and processes.
