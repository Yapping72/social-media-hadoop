Additionally, if you\u2019re ahead of schedule and objectively meeting goals you aren\u2019t congratulated but instead given arbitrary tasks to complete. Even if objectively meeting goals, management (just one person I\u2019m talking about) will start to criticize personality traits and hand out a lot of \u201cdo this because I said so\u201d type of tasks that never get used to test your patience. People will throw others under the bus constantly. There is an arbitrary yearly goal system where three to four goals are your main tasks for the year but management has no issue turning this into 15 items, especially if they are passive aggressive. There is a remote work policy in place but it\u2019s arbitrarily approved and is frowned upon. The location is terrible for younger employees who want to live in the city. The buildings have mold in carpets and in ceiling tiles and you can hear people coughing constantly (not all buildings).
