Alot of middle management amd micro management.. no care for employee morale or well being. Toxic culture.. see something say something is one of the mantras, which basically allows people to attack you for minor things without repercussions.. for example.. say you spill milk while making tea.. you would be ate alive before you get a chance to get a tissue to clean it. It's a bully culture. One rule for management another for employees.. for example during the pandemic.. masks and social distances were strictly enforced.. with people getting in trouble from directors for forgetting to put mask back on after eating.. or not standing far enough away from people.. when clearly you are consciously trying to keep 2 meters.. but everyone's understanding of 2 meters differs. One person per table was enforced.. However.. site head was allowed to sit on a table with 6 other managers.. rubbing this clearly into the faces of the hard working staff.. no doubt half the shift handed in their notice shortly after. Upstairs staff make changes to downstairs processing without ever consulting with the people these changes affect.. ultimately introducing unsafe procedures as they don't understand how the process works. Alot of covering up when auditors are on site.. creating unsafe environments as a result.. one thing that is huge.. is in a clean room.. there's are no scissors.. so BPS open plastic packaging with pens.. if there are aiditors.. we are asked not to do any set ups because it would highlight all the problems. No desire to improve amd establish themselves because its so easy to climb the ladder.. no proper changes are made only temp fixes that look good on your cv. No focus on retaining staff.. they much prefer to hire new because the salaries are lower. You are responsible for everything.. payroll, continuous improvement, processing, training etc.. you do about 6 jobs in one.. there should be separate departments for all the work you do.. but there isn't because Regeneron are cheap. When you see a constant turn over of staff.. that should show red flags immediately.. there's a reason people are leaving the company so often. Its great short term to gain experience.. but long term.. you wouldn't be able to stick it. Also.. they never have done a fire drill.. there was a small fire in the kitchen.. nobody moved when the alarm went off because nobody knew what the alarm was. \r\n\r\n\r\nSafety is non existent.\r\n\r\n I could go on and on.. but I don't think there is enough hours in the day.. it is not a great place to work..

There isn't really a dress code - you can wear whatever you want, within reason, including jeans (think your high school dress code). No need for business/business casual for most non-corporate people. Training/onboarding was pretty thorough for new employees, which helped people coming straight from college feel at ease.", "cons": "They stress during onboarding that advancement opportunities are really plentiful - if you are in your current position for a few years and want to gain experience in a different department, you can easily apply for internal positions . It makes sense for most companies to hire from within, but my experience is that it would be easier to quit and either find a job elsewhere or reply at Regeneron from the outside than it is to apply as an internal hire. If you are hired as a BPS in manufacturing, at least in mid-scale, you will never leave. They know turnover rate for BPS's is high (because that's the entry-level right-out-of-college position) and they want to minimize that, but to such an extent that it makes employees extremely unhappy and a lot of people just quit and get jobs elsewhere. For lead/supervisor roles, it seems like the BPS's that are chosen for the jobs are chosen for their relationships to the interviewers (in a \"pick your best friend for your dodgeball team in gym class\" kind of way) rather than their merit, experience, or leadership abilities. This is incredibly discouraging. Mid-scale manufacturing (versus large-scale manufacturing) has, and continues to make, arbitrary rules regarding your ability to switch shifts or apply for lead/supervisor positions - you have to have been on your current shift for at least 11 months. This means that if you're placed on the night shift and find that it really doesn't work for you, you can't apply for a day shift position (even if it's open and no one else wants it) simply because you've only been on your current shift for 9 months. If you don't get along with your direct management in a way that causes you extreme amounts of stress on a daily basis, but you've only been on your current shift for 3 months, your only option is to quit or stay and allow your professional performance and mental health suffer as a result. They care more about employee retention than anything else, but don't do much to ensure that you are excelling at your job.
