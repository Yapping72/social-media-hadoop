In 2009 there were no raises for anyone even though the company made billions more in profits than forecast. There's no increase in paid time off for 5 years and our insurance benefits are horrible. For 2011 our health insurance is 80/20; much like Medicare and with huge deductibles. Local management is horrible; totally unqualified and untrained. At my location the management style is threats, intimidation and retaliation but because the department makes so much money thanks to Federal subsidies, corporate doesn't care. We are treated and talked to as if we're children. We are rarely given the tools we need to do our jobs; we have computer programs that seldom work, information that is 3 or 4 years out of date and managers actually get angry if they're questioned about such things. Our job performances are rated based on \"quality\" evaluations where a recorded call is dissected line by line and points deducted if we don't follow scripts written by people who've never worked with the customers or answered a call. It may take 3 hours for a \"quality analyst\" to score a 3 minute phone call and much of the scoring is completely subjective. Every time a different \"quality analyst\" scores your calls you have to adjust yourself to that particular person. They do not take into account whether or not the customer was pleased or satisfied with the results of the call; if you did not say the 857 things they want you to get in on each call, you lose points on that call. The company is so incredibly cheap that we had a company picnic for the first time this year but had to pay if we wanted to attend. Needless to say, very few employees attended.

Telecommuters used to be reimbursed for their cells phones and internet connections but that stopped.  Sales folks comp plans were decreased by two-thirds.  They'll fire someone without any plans to hire a replacement and just throw the work at someone else who already has more than they can handle.  With so many layers of management, the favoritism allows some managers to practice unethical behaviors.  If you call HR for assistance, you won't get it, as they always favor management.  When management has you pegged to leave, they will do everything to push you over the edge so you'll leave voluntarily as they don't want to pay the severance.  I have never heard so many employees speak so badly about the working conditions or complain about how unhappy they are.  Compensation is mediocre.  Raises, although given every year, are minimum.  Tuition reimbursement is limited to $1,500 a year.  Medical benefits are the absolute worse only providing catastrophic coverage.  Deductibles are high $1500+ and out of pocket is around $4,000 before they'll cover 80% and this is a health care company.

Later on the same leader trying to add employees without any projects in pipeline. I feel for those new employees where they are getting into the mess.\r\n\r\nYou can not ( i mean can not ) take what they say about the work in interviews on face value. In some cases the work itself is not there. They are just trying to fill empty position ID's created by employee resignations. There will be months without any work. A well reasoned self respecting IT guy will go mad without work here.\r\nI have seen people coming to office just to Turn on the Computer ( Some level 27 guys as well ) or running their own business using UHG as a side income. Politics is just a class above anywhere else and is at a very unhealthy level.\r\n\r\nToo much party without any real success to spice up the \"no work\" boring life. Come on - every dollar UHG saves is a dollar for a patient care. They do not value what they say.\r\n\r\nNo Technology thought leadership. When whole world is becoming engineering heavy - This organization is becoming more managerial heavy. Its well known that Captive organizations offer less head room for promotion where as you get to own the work you do. The pride of doing something technically good for your organization should be there. Here its futile to even try to start anything. You will be shot down by over conservative less techie management. Or they will provide lip service to create it as if they are providing lollipop to a crying baby.\r\n\r\nThere are some good people also and good work happening in pockets But they are few in number and rapidly depleting. The soul of the organization is lost in India. The way it was created by Mr Mishra is no longer now present. Its running for the sake of running. If i were in UHG IT management in MPLS, i would give a critical look at the india leadership in IT. UHG india is a money sink created and it will continue to bleed sick patient insurance dollars without any bang for its true worth.\r\n\r\nThe sad part is there are too many managers playing the system. You will be forced to join this ghetto and take wrong advantage of the system or you will be sidelined/ ignored from a broad sector of management. You will be talked about in parties as a non compliant member. \r\n\r\nManagement communicates with well articulated english statements. You won't find any value or meaning from what they say. The sentences are well formulated at an abstraction level where you can relate it to World peace forum talks. \r\n\r\nBTW i still think business process outsourcing running out of india is a value add to UHG and its doing good. on a conservative scale even If 60% IT from india is abolished UHG will not be impacted.\r\n\r\nI so regret getting into this company and wasting my productive IT career while i was there. I was not a low end performer as some would think from this review. In all organizations i have worked i have got awards from near CIO level for my hands on technical work and in UHG also i have been rewarded from same level.

Seasonal work fluctuation - for example, some departments can go months with very little to do, so they're just in the office trying to look busy and getting more and more frustrated because of lack of work, and yet management continue to hire more people into these departments.\r\n4. Opportunities for advancement in this location are bare, many employees are constantly applying for positions in other UHG locations.\r\n5. Turn over is revolving door - most new people after being there a few months realized they had been duped during the interviews and start looking for other jobs.\r\n6. The culture that is reinforced by management is toxic, encourages clicks and employees to spy and tell on each other.\r\n7. The top manager will not allow the supervisors to actually do their work effectively.\r\n8. Manager and supervisors regularly target and harass employees they do not like. For example, pregnant employees not being allowed to work from home when they're not feeling well (if employee does not want to get an occurrence), but the manager/supervisors work from home and have flexible schedules as they please.\r\n9. The vital signs survey results have been very poor over the past few years but there was no change in management and no positive changes on the real issues that employees gave feedback on.\r\n10. Rampant unprofessional behavior among management, they behave like it's their own business and employee feedback to corporate HQ in Minneapolis about this has been ignored (HR will take your feedback but no follow up action is taken)."}, {"review_title": "Regret", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Feb 2017", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Green Bay, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay.

You will start out in a 16 week training class with about 20 other new hires. If you wonder why so many new hires at a time it's because about half of you won't make it out of training. Turn over is very high!  The building in Green Bay is pretty big. And it's basically empty. No one wants to stay there. Training is good at first but once you start taking calls you will realize you don't know nearly as much as you need to. Trainers will eventually make you feel stupid for asking questions and degrade you in front of others for asking. Multiple people quit my class for the way they were treated. If you manage to last thru training you go into a nesting phase. The supervisors there do absolutely nothing and almost ignore you completely unless you do something wrong. Then you hear from them real quick. They never praise on the good things. Just negative. They want you to be robots. No small talk, no hold time, no emotion. If you don't know an answer to someone's question good luck finding it. You will have to search thru about 1000 documents or \"sop's\" to find it. Like a needle in a haystack. Don't count on restroom breaks when you have to go. You can only go on your scheduled breaks. If you need to use \"personal time\" to go then your penalized. Health benefits suck.

Employees are put on a timer as though they are in kindergarten!  Micromanaging the masses is the name of the game, here.  The biggest problem is that the training and the processes are truly over the top and nightmarish.  I could not believe I had become a part of this mess.   Everyone in my class was lost and confused.  Upon talking with a few of them at break time, I learned that they were very upset that they had even come here to begin with... a feeling that had washed over me within just a few days of starting.  The processes were extremely and unnecessarily complex with endless numbers of steps to complete in order to finish just one enrollment, and the instructor could not answer many of our questions.  Each case had its own challenges.  After only two weeks of training,  a new employee is scored on all of their work, and raises are withheld (all .25 cents) if even one mistake is made in the course of a year.   There was an employee who had been there nearly two decades who had never been given a raise.  After being there for a few months, just when I had begun to feel like I was gaining a handle on the process, I was forced to learn a new task.  The training was just as brutal with the second process and again I was among other employees who were confused and upset.  \r\n\r\nEach employee is given a cubicle that is about the size of a broom closet and is required to take their laptop home every night - carting it back and forth daily.  There is no longer a cafeteria at this company (just vending machines) and there are only a few microwaves for hundreds of people to use.  Having to stand in line with only a half hour lunch break barely gave me enough time to eat.  The benefits offered to employees are terrible - and this is a health insurance company!!  Employees were often denied a requested day off, and were given the reason that two others had requested the same day off, even though there were 54 people doing the same job.  Additionally, they do not pay out unused earned time off when an employee leaves, since it is not required in NH.

Many requests take multiple approvals, many of which get lost in the system.\r\n\r\nIf you are working in the Tower expect to work with some of the biggest egos around.  There are too many VPs that have undefined jobs and don't deliver results.  Instead of taking responsibility for their inability, they take out their frustrations on their staff.  Each VP wants to be more important than the other.  So they suck up to the top leaders for time, staff and resources.  \r\n\r\nMany employees are overworked, while others, especially certain VPs, are often out of the office on personal junkets.  The dedicated lower level employees carry the department.  Stress levels are high, and rewards are few.

There is no rhyme or reason when people get promoted or selected for trips or special privileges. Sister company in Orlando cheats the system so they get the lions share of bonuses and still keep their jobs. It's common knowledge and despicable. Only a small percentage of people get a bonus. Some employees are very toxic to the environment and make it even harder to work there. You NEVER GET A RAISE! Only about 12 days off a year are accrued for sick leave and vacation time. Your schedule can change from day shift to 3-midnight and you are given a \"take it or leave it\" offer.

Yet, when I ask the interviewing manager about the reason they went elsewhere (yes I have the nerve to ask) they say its because of how I answered my questions, they didn't flow with the company culture.  Yet when I see who they hire instead, those people are usually female, undereducated and have very little time at UHC-this leads me to believe they want someone who they can mold, not someone with original ideas.  This also leads me to believe that they are  dishonest and jealousy in their upper-management team.  Instead of wanting you to succeed they make sure you stay down with the other colored folks.  It is also strife with sexism (at least in my immediate office and locale).  No advancement for males in a highly concentrated area dominated by older female, reverse sexism exists!  I have experienced this throughout my tenure at UHC and am simply sick of it.  I also believe that it's who you know that will get you promoted, I recently applied for a certain position, 2 weeks later was told it was filled, yet came on Glassdoor.com and it is still posted (no it's not a different one HR Talent people it's the same req#- but nice try!).  Upper management brags about yearly profits yet when raises come they say \"sorry, we're struggling\" then they go and make a big budget movie of themselves (with special 3D effects) dancing around Texas and showing it to employees during Corporate meetings.  I could smell the disgust in the atmosphere from all of the employees who sat near me, yet they all clapped because hey you don't want to upset their boss and CEO.

However, with some of the recent issues that have impacted the company, I'm not so sure about that any longer.\r\n\r\nSenior management is far too removed from the actual work and should not be making any decisions that impact the operational, day to day work. Unfortunately, they often do make these decisions and it causes unnecessary additional work or introduces new inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nManagement is continually making decisions to cover their own butts and ensure their own job security, even at the expense of the employees' work-life balance, employee morale, and the overall company. They should be leading the company and looking for ways to make improvements. Instead they often spend their time and energy trying to shift blame on another department and take the CEO's scrutiny away from themselves.\r\n\r\nThe company is technologically challenged.  Access, Excel, and an outdated claims system are considered acceptable platforms by senior management, when the rest of the industry is using far more sophisticated tools.

A number of managers are prejudicial and you can see it when they take over a office or team.

HR is not done by UHG, but is also outsourced.  But even the outsource company doesn't give consistent answers and the company is notorious about not giving the full policy to employees (doesn't matter if it is Dental, Vision, Medical, or HR they quote the pretty picture and then when an exception comes up they say \"it's in our policy.....\"  Not that the employee can see it.  \r\n\r\nAs for regulations UHG makes the grand gesture in their written policies, but then doesn't support them with staff or hours to comply.  So they are never done or only done minimally. At least until a regulator comes then its time to run around and look like they've been doing it all along.  \r\n\r\nMost entry level leaders are driven to keep employees who walk in the door and don't want to be there.  \"We paid so much to recruit them.\"  So everyone else suffers them not doing their job or not doing it right.  Finally, mgmt will take action, maybe some \"coaching\" which is a fancy way of referring to a discussion that you aren't meeting X or Y.    Most projects never get done properly because upper mgmt always wants everything yesterday, most things aren't planned with enough lead time to execute them well, or if they are the time is moved up.   Example, they have been saying they are migrating soon to a new desktop OS.... at least 3 years but true to form in 2009 reorganization resulted in the ball getting dropped for over a year.  Wish they did real supply chain mgmt, it would have reduced a lot of headaches.  Since no system does everything it was intended to do everything has a work around.  Service reps have to access 9 to 14 systems to service many calls.   If you decide to work for UHG be aware of their rep for reorganization and keep copies (paper) of everything if you have a problem boss since if it's in their system it's their property.

No raises, low pay for all the work they expect of you. During the crisis with the economy, UHC started firing employees for trivial infractions  such as coughing on the phone and for grammar related errors like saying \"seen\" when maybe you should say the word \"saw\". They switched representatives jobs and didn't give the training for the job they were expecting them to do. When those employee's started making mistakes, they were written up and up to terminated (it didn't matter that they hadn't received the proper training for the job they were doing).  No employee is treated the same across the board:  whether you can do an awesome job doesn't matter--it only matters if you get a supervisor or manager that likes you and will vouch for you. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing..half the employees are doing their job based on old information while the other half have the updated information. Management gives conflicting information and the supervisors don't stand by anything they tell you even if they gave it to you in writing.  \r\n\r\nFor an insurance company, they have some of the worse health plans. We voiced our opinions about the desire for better health plans and to show how little they listen, our health plans got worse: we have very high deductibles and are being forced to use HSA's where the funds must build up in the account. Until then, we are responsible for ALL medical services. Of course we will be able to use fsa's but only for vision and dental...we can't even use it for prescriptions (it's limited because we will have a HSA). \r\n\r\nGetting time off is hard to do because out of over 200 people, if 3 are already off, they can't possibly spare a 4th person to be off. I feel the calls are not evenly distributed among representatives when you have two different people taking the same types of calls and one person is getting back to back calls while the other is getting a call every 5-10 minutes. \r\n\r\nTheir systems (computers & phones) are HORRIBLE. And that UES survey!!!!!  they don't even know how it truly works yet they allow the survey results to be used in our metrics which ultimately affect our bonuses, the opportunity to get a decent schedule & work from home. The UHC phone system is notorious for dropping calls....but with UES, the call disconnects from the representative & transfers the caller to the survey where the caller leaves a horrible rating for the representative even though that representative never actually got a chance to handle the call. 2 or more of the survey questions asked conflict with how we are told to do our jobs: it basically asks if we explained benefits in a way that they can understand it...however, we are told by management NEVER interpret the benefits..read benefits just as they are in the system (which is usually surrounded with a bunch of legal jargon that even us representatives don't understand). its a no win situation because if we go out on a limb and try to explain the benefit, we lose our bonus, get a bad schedule on the next shift bid, and if  you are a work at home rep, you have to go into the office for 90days. if we do as told and read exactly what's in the system without interpreting the benefit for the caller, we get a bad survey...which results in loss of bonus,a bad schedule, and if  you are a work at home rep, into the office you go for 90days.  Originally we were told bad surveys would be reviewed by the individual supervisor or manager to determine if they are valid or actually belonged to that individual but that changed. Now, if you are unlucky enough to get a caller who likes you but is unsatisfied with UHC as a company...AND they clearly say in the survey message, \"susie-q is a great representative but uhc is a horrible company and needs to do better\",   you are out of luck and stuck with that bad survey."}, {"review_title": "neutral", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 Jun 2010", "job_title": "Contractor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good middle level people to work with.

A few months in, I was trained to use a certain computer system and was moved to a different team. We did have a bit of training from someone on the team that had been there for years. However, it had been some time since she had performed our job and constantly gave out wrong information in which we were audited on. Errors were a big no no and you were kindly informed with a big red ! that you've done something wrong. On top of having a quality and production standard that was nearly possible to accomplish, everyone on the team save for a few of us worked from home. Trust me when I say, sitting in an office while you listen to your co-workers birds in the background can make you twinge a little with envy. There's a little chance you'll get a day off. Most days are taken up before you can consider taking them off. You also cannot call in sick more than three times, regardless if you're on your death bed.  Deal with being overwhelmed and stressed with the unlimited/constantly changing SOPs that make it even harder to perform your job to what is expected of you, you also have kiss up to get ahead. If not, be prepared to have your supervisor demean you in whatever snide way they can without being to blatant about it. Your supervisor depending on your department, will not have your back.

The hiring managers were quick to get me to fill out the assessment and conduct the phone interview however afterwards it took months to hear back about when the training would start. I didn\u2019t receive the information regarding start date and location until the weekend of. While in training we trained in an open room right next to another set of training classes so we had to keep our voices down and do a lot of our learning through websites with our headsets on. The training itself was an overview not an actual in depth training. Everyday we came in and learned a new system never reviewing the previous materials.  With the facility being new to the Dublin area all of our management was brought in from outside companies or from other UHC sites so no one seemed to know what they were doing or how this site was going to run. The supervisor still doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing in his role so he provided no help when we were on the floor facing issues. His answers was always I don\u2019t know never once did he point us in the direction of where to get answers. The attendance policy was never fully disclosed until a number of agents were on corrective actions because again it was the blind leading the blind. We weren\u2019t fully equipped to help the members to the best of our abilities. The assistance/mentors they brought it barely answered questions and had attitudes when being asked to help. There were very few team meetings, feedback seemed to fall on deaf ears, & there was absolutely no coaching at all before we were considered experienced agents. All in all if I had never heard of United healthcare I would\u2019ve thought this was a start up company just finding its way. As a result a lot of us from my training class have quit with just a few months experience under our belts. To add there\u2019s no cafeteria in the building. The food they do have to offer is old and kept in a lil fridge and far more expensive than any fast food or gas station. They don\u2019t give out any company merchandise for you to show you work for their company. There\u2019s no team bonding. Upper management never introduces themselves they just walk around as if you\u2019re suppose to know who they are. Management favors certain agents over others and it shows. This is a company that doesn\u2019t care about their employees at all. They don\u2019t listen to the feedback given, they give you a million and one responsibilities on top of you taking emotionally distressing calls, they lack organization and consistency, and they do not fully disclose the job details to you at the time of hire. There is NO work life balance.

You will find substandard benefits with high deductible plans which are are a challenge for younger employees seeking to start a family, especially when you have a $6,000 deductible not to mention out-of-pocket expenses paid at 80% if you are lucky.  As a result, there is a lot of frustration within the ranks but rather than bonding together, you will find that many employees are hostile and very difficult to work with.  On the management side, what's good for the goose is not necessarily good for the gander.  For example, many employees are tied to a hub location so if you leave that location, you are a target to be forced to resign but this does not apply to directors and vice presidents.  In terms of IT, the group lacks sophistication at the executive level so they latch onto current industry trends such as PMP and Agile rather than evaluating what works for their business model and developing a methodology that suits their needs.  Some of this is because they want to take the Optum services to the commercial market and believe that PMI credentials and specific methodologies will provide sales opportunities but internally, their processes are so tied up in red tape and copious documents, which naturally take time away from effective and productive activities, that execution is and will be a challenge.

My first original call was to FILE for short term disability!! I had no idea what FMLA was... I was just a 21 year old who was going into the adult world and someone should have offered that to me when I was denied.  The HR person was rude and said, there was no note about me calling in to file for anything.

I was screwed. \r\nTHANKS, UHC for screwing up my LIFE!\r\n\r\nAfter being let go, I found out, I was the lowest paying employee compared to everyone in my training class. They looked down on me because I was a minority and female. While everyone was getting paid 12-14/ hour, I was only getting paid 11.25/hr. and I'm the one with experience.
