Keep that in mind when reading.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've been here only 6 months, but I think I have enough of a feel for Optum to write a review.\r\n\r\nThe positives:\r\nGreat work/life balance: I never have to stay late, work on weekends, etc. I get 23 vacation days and my manager encourages me to use them AND completely unplug while away. \r\n\r\nBeautiful office: I work at the new Optum office in Eden Prairie. Building is modern and comfortable. Full size gym and locker room, and workout classes. Great parking ramp with a skyway so you never need to go outside in the rain or snow!\r\n\r\nWork from home: VERY progressive with WFH! I can work from wherever I want. if I want to WFH one day, I can. If I want to WFH the whole week, I can do that, too. No one questions you.\r\n\r\nTotal autonomy\r\n\r\nNo drama: This is a very heads down place! I can't stress that enough. No one socializes with each other -- most of the time, you never even talk to your cube neighbors (because they're probably working from home). This is a positive for me though -- after working in some high drama offices, this is a refreshing change. \r\n\r\nAll meetings are over webex: Great news if you hate in-person meetings like I do -- because there are very few! In the 6 months I've been here, I've had 4 in person meetings. This is also a con because you never meet your coworkers - read the con list for more info. \r\n\r\n30 minute \"best practice\" meeting times: You will not get invited to 2+ hour meetings, ever. Nearly all meetings are only 30 minutes. You might have the one-off meeting that's an hour, but it's rare. \r\n\r\nGood, standardized PM practices. But some of the documentation requirements are too rigid and can slow progress down. Our group is trying to move to 100% agile. Slowly.... All of my projects so far have been waterfall SDLC. Although as a new person, it would help to have a PM to shadow on some of these documentation/audit practices. I've had to learn as I go. \r\n\r\n- Great cafeteria with cheap prices. I can get a lunch here cheaper than I can bring it from home.\r\n\r\n-Very engaging training classes!!! All training classes are over LearnSource (i.e. your computer) but the videos are well done and entertaining.", "cons": "-Building seems empty because so many people WFH. It's almost kind of...sad. Such a nice building but no one is there.\r\n\r\n-Internet explorer is the browser of choice. Yuck. You have to have special permissions to download Google Chrome or Firefox on your computer.\r\n\r\n-If you like socializing with your coworkers, this is NOT a place for you! I can't stress that enough!! You will NOT meet your new BFF here. Everyone is very heads-down and focused on work -- no one chit chats about football or True Detective! You will not have coworkers stopping by your desk (to chat about a TV show OR to even chat about work). Most of my days, I don't talk to anyone in person. It's kind of depressing -- and I'm an introvert! There are no happy hours, social events outside of work, etc (this is a positive for me because I hate that stuff).\r\n\r\n-Lots of contractors. Not that it's a bad thing - I've had great experiences with the PM contractors. They obviously don't last as long as the employees, and there's more contractor PMs than employee PMs.\r\n\r\n-Difficult, as a new person, to know \"who's who.\" There is no face-to-face meetings, so as a PM, it's tough to know who does what, since there's no face to put with the name. I struggle with this a lot, as I'm not used to this extreme of a \"remote\" workforce! \r\n\r\n-No wifi for your phone. Wifi is only available for visitors and you must have a user name and password. \r\n\r\n-Nearly all social media websites are blocked. Not really a con, but something you might want to know. You won't be browsing facebook at work!\r\n\r\n-LOTS of meetings. Sure, the meetings aren't in person, they're over Webex, but you will have a LOT of them.\r\n\r\n-Some \"know-it-all\" ego-driven coworkers, especially on the tech side. But this is typical of IT in general.

You are a number to this company, they will not invest in your growth. Management will not tell you this, and will tell you to look at some pdf documents or something.\r\n\r\n-Housecalls program is a call center. Do not let the interview/recruiter person tell you differently. People from my training class quit once they found out. \r\n\r\n-Strict call center metrics (AHT/ACW) etc. Did not want you going to the bathroom unless you were on your scheduled 15 minute break. ( They are begging for OSHA and ADA violations) \r\n\r\n- Micromanaging to the extreme. Every second is tracked, and they have a points system (more than 5 minutes late and you get a partial point etc, if you get 3 points you're in trouble type deal, if you're over your allotted acw time a manager will ping you to ask why, even if the notes take forever to type in) \r\n\r\n- Emergencies are not tolerated, and there is no flexibility with your schedule, good luck getting time off, or having a stable lunch break at the same time every day, it changes daily \r\n\r\n- Lunches are 30 minutes only, and if you get stuck on a call and end up having to go later than your scheduled time, you get in trouble. \r\n\r\n- You are only a warm body to answer phones, there is no upward mobility. \r\n\r\n- benefits suck, which is surprising for an insurance company. High deductible unless you opt for the copay plan and that's an in network only plan (Premiums are ridiculous, and raises are non existent so you end up losing money after your first year employed here if you keep the insurance) plus they have a spouse coverage surcharge of $150 a month\r\n\r\n- provided company wifi, however wifi is not fast enough to do your work. \r\n\r\n- hiring process took way too long, and everything was ridiculously complicated (for no good reason) \r\n\r\n- the job they hired for is basic call center, however the ad required 2 separate medical trainings and a set year amount of medical experience. I think they just wanted medically familiar people so they didn't have to train, as I am grossly overqualified. \r\n\r\n-training is different from what you're doing on the floor. Once you start doing live calls, what you learned in training is useless. \r\n\r\n- you will be chained to your desk, as this is back to back phone calls but they will not tell you that in training. \r\n\r\n- pay started at $23 an hour and I'm still at 23 an hour. \r\n\r\n- because of insanely high turnover, I constantly receive emails and requests to refer friends to the position which I would never do because of the gross misleading nature of how I was hired (ew, feels MLM/scammy) \r\n\r\n- can only speak for my department, but we aren't actually doing any good, we are just autodialing people and harassing them for medical information. Half the people are annoyed at how many times we call and the other half of the patients just say what they have to so they can shut us up. \r\n\r\n- the tuition reimbursement kicks in after you work for 6 months but if you leave within 24 months of accepting it (from what I understand) you have to pay it back. Plus it's only like 5k anyway. \r\n\r\n- the software is OLD. It sucks. No seriously, they tell you not to put in tickets to IT because they know the issues, but they don't ever get fixed. Can't save assessments and submit them for 5-6-10 minutes at a time, but if you're in acw for longer than they think is necessary because you're waiting on the assessment to save you're in trouble, even though you can't use the program without saving, so you're set up for failure.\r\n\r\n- programs were not properly provisioned even up to the day you are supposed to take phone calls out of training. (Which makes training extra useless since you can't use the programs you are trying to be trained for) \r\n\r\n- my manager is nice, and my co-workers are good people, but my god are the rules here draconian and downright sociopathic. \r\n\r\n- this place squeezes as much productivity as they can get of you, and penalizes you for even 1 minute out of productivity. Have to pee after an hour but break isn't until later? Oh well, have an occurrence for using the bathroom. Doorbell rang and you want to step away for a minute to sign a package? Nope, that'll be trouble for you and not approved. Have a writeup.\r\n\r\n - I applied here because I thought that I would be doing good here, but this place will just grind you down and take whatever productivity they can and threaten your job security until you quit so they don't have to pay unemployment. Whatever buzzwords and things they tell you to get you in the door is a lie. I wish I never applied here, I wish I never went through training and accepted the position and as soon as I find something else, I will wash my hands of this company and never associate with them again.

You will be working 45-50 hours per work, every week, all year. Know this and either accept it and apply or avoid.

The only time they hire more people is when it gets above that and they only hire enough to bring it back down to the numbers I just listed. - you are a number, nothing more. All your meetings and discussions will be about your numbers and how they rank, you are set competitively with all other rphs. Extreme metrics to be met and endless micro managing. If you are fast and accurate you will be okay. Do NOT apply if you know you are kind of slow and like to be super thorough. - pay is low - you will start between 50-55 per hour. Raises are yearly based on your rank 1-5 and a 3 gets 1% raise, a 4 gets 2% and a 5 (which is impossible) gets a 3% - work from home which is convenient and nice but also boring. You have no interaction with team members or anyone else throughout the day. No camraderie, you do your work and sign out. Maybe you will like that. - after training you will be dropped off a cliff. Sink or swim. After training and a 4 week ramp you are expected to hit the same numbers as everyone else. And there is no go-to person for help. Better memorize all those job aids and keep up with the endless procedure changes. If you survive the drop after training you will be okay. - it\u2019s a decent job, monotonous and boring, but not bad, but it\u2019s a terrible company.

As a result, they will continue to have challenges recruiting and retaining those from the talented Millennial generation. Let\u2019s take a look at what I\u2019m calling their family-support benefits:\n1.) ALERT- not all of their plans include fertility coverage and even when fertility is covered they require to use their own program, Optum Fertility Solutions. This is a horribly abrasive program that further prolongs someone\u2019s ability to have a child. The program is antiquated and puts up a lot of barriers.\n2.) UHG doesn\u2019t create separation between their salaried and hourly employees when it comes to benefits. There is not an option to receive 100% of pay while out on Short Term Disability for having a child. You can buy up from 60% to 80% for a great deal of money. I paid over $1,000 for an additional 20% of pay and guess what, I won\u2019t be using the benefit this year. Companies have already noted salaries in their books for the entire year, which means it would cost them NO money to institute salary continuation for their salary employees. This isn\u2019t offered at UHG.\n3.) Paid parental leave is only 6 weeks. They recently increased this from 4 weeks. Guys, you can go be an hourly Amazon employee and receive 20 weeks of fully paid parental leave. 6 weeks is insulting. \n4.) While on leave you don\u2019t get paid holidays!!!! If you don\u2019t submit PTO for holidays, such as Christmas, you won\u2019t be paid!! << this is one of the most ludicrous practices I\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nDon\u2019t let them tell you this is what benefits are like at all large insurance carriers. That is not true. I know for a fact the Blues and Cigna are far more generous here. UHG doesn\u2019t use consultants to help with their benefits strategy and it appears they also don\u2019t leverage benchmarking. Either that, or they don\u2019t care. Likely a combination of both.

Health insurance (but high deductible) and definitely average. Better than nothing. Huge company with a lot of opportunity for those who will pursue it.", "cons": "1. There is no flexibility in this job. \n\nYou are tied to your computer all day with two breaks and lunch. There are no part time options, and after shift bid, your shift is your shift. You must clock in and out exactly on the minute for every task that you perform. They force you to turn on your computer in advance of the workday to be logged in at exactly the start of your shift, which is apparently legal because they give you paid breaks. \n\n2. Every single thing you do is tracked. \n\nThey use a system to track your activities and metrics, and measure your adherence but it doesn't work, and they still tell you that you have to be 95% compliant (with the faulty software). They won't correct it either, even when it's wrong. They send your adherence report with the errors with that same note that you should be at 95%. All of your calls are recorded. You are evaluated on your calls on a monthly basis. All day long the team lead hounds you to tell you if your \"after call work\" is too many seconds, and the software will pop up with annoying messages that you have placed a member on hold many times while you are trying to resolve a difficult problem. This is supposed to be helpful, but it isn't. It's like having a mosquito buzzing you and biting you all day long. Some problems are very difficult, involve many phone calls, and require the member to be placed on hold. Everyone knows this.\n\n3. Toxic positivity rules. \n\nThere is a culture of \"pretending\" in which you must pretend everything is great, even when you are not given the information and resources to do your job. If you question anything you will be considered a troublemaker. Top down organization. If you want to be promoted, grin , pretend, and do the work. Often times a change will be implemented, and there are errors with the change. Instead of fixing the errors, leadership will suggest workarounds that simply lead to other problems. \n\n4. The environment is extremely negative. \n\nYou are threatened with being fired for being just one minute late, but you are expected to take calls and work late if you have to. So if you get a call at 4:59 you have to take it or you could get fired. In meetings corrective action plans will be discussed, and how to not get fired is a frequent topic. Also your metrics will be displayed in public so everyone knows if you are meeting the required metrics. \n\n5. The metrics are faulty and the small bonuses are hard to get. \n\nYou are evaluated on metrics that are highly questionable and subject to chance. Some of these metrics clearly lack face-validity, are not appropriately targeted to gather relevant data, and have negative unintended consequences with respect to their implementation. If one person gives you a bad survey in a month because they are mad about their late enrollment penalty that you cannot fix you won't get your tiny little bonus even if you worked your tail off all month and you are a well respected and appreciated advocate. Management doesn't care if you got 20 surveys and 17 of them were all tens. The two angry people will mean that you don't meet the threshhold for a bonus and you won't get it. \n\n6. You can't schedule or take PTO with ease. \n\nIt is Impossible to take PTO because they seem to always be understaffed. As soon as you think maybe you have enough staff, they'll start moving people around until you have call after call and there won't be any PTO. If you quit, they won't pay unused PTO (depending on state law) because they say it is a \"grant.\" So they won't let you take it when you work or when you quit. While the company makes billions, they want all the call center workers to use their PTO when it is slow, and won't let employees secure dates for family vacations far in advance or even promise that they can take them months (or even a year) in advance. They open a vacation window in May or June for the last six months of the year, and then everyone jumps in there to try to get the days off they need. But only a couple of people can take a single day off, and often there are no days you can take off at all in the next three months. Of course, opening up the window so late means you can't buy plane tickets far in advance or even count on being able to take that vacation at all. If you can't get the days, they won't help you and you'll have to take \"occurrences\" which could result in you being fired. There is not even any way to go to the doctor without a strike against you. \n\nThe low level customer service managers are just trying to get promoted to the next level, so they won't address the systemic issues and general lack of respect provided to these essential call center workers who are the heart of the business. They want their metrics to be the best so they can get the next promotion. They just tell you to \"be positive.\""}, {"review_title": "-", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Senior Project Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good environment to work in, motivating", "cons": "i don't have any cons to add  for the time being"}, {"review_title": "Mediocre pay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "11 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Supervisor, customer service quality", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Career advancement is available to you", "cons": "Some senior leadership is untrustworthy"}, {"review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Clinical Administrative Coordinator", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for.

Hopefully a lot of these policies have changed for the better, but the following is my personal and true experience with the company.\r\n\r\nI worked in the BAR (Benefits, Authorizations, and Referrals) department for mental health. I would take calls from members and providers on a variety of issues. There were back to back calls, which was to be expected, but we had very little time to ourselves. The ACW (after call work) average was 45 seconds. They only wanted us to spend 45 seconds after a call to finish our notes and catch our breaths before going back into the queue. Are you serious?\r\n\r\nThe calls were very triggering, too. I remember getting calls from people threatening to harm themselves and others. We aren't crisis managers; we aren't trained to handle suicidal people and the fact that it was our responsibility to make sure that they got to the right place (often with a long hold time), it put a lot of unfair pressure on us.\r\n\r\nWe were only allowed a 30 minute lunch, and I believe that we should have at least 45 minutes to an hour to recharge after taking calls nonstop for four hours. We were also allowed two 15 minute breaks, but if we went over it by a minute, there would be managers asking us what the problem was.\r\n\r\nTheir PTO / Holiday agreement was awful. I'm not sure if this was limited to only CSRs, but if we wanted to get holiday pay, we'd have to work the day before AND the day after the holiday. Let's say it's Memorial Day weekend, and you want to take the Friday before it off. Well, you won't be getting paid for that Monday! God forbid people want to have an extra day off to spend with their family or just to relax without being penalized for it.\r\n\r\nThe turnover rate was very high. People were quitting this job before the training was even over! By the time I left, half of my training class had quit. And now, less than a year later, none of the people that I trained with currently work at that position anymore. You would think the higher ups at UHG would notice it and realize the common denominator.\r\n\r\nThere was also more responsibility for the same pay. During my final two weeks at the position, I heard from my coworkers that they were going to be trained in claims which would mean taking on an additional set of callers, but their pay would not be increased. \r\n\r\nThe health insurance wasn't good. How are we working at one of the largest health insurance companies and the options that they offer their employees are trash?! Some people weren't able to afford the insurance at all because the pay was so low. I was able to get the most expensive insurance, but that still came with a high deductible.\r\n\r\nI could go on for much longer, but I, along with my coworkers, was so eager to leave this job.

He would always reach out if something seemed wrong to make sure you were ok and taken care of and would take your side if something went wrong and truly advocated for his team. I was switched teams to another Supervisor who consistently micromanaged you for every little thing never giving praise for doing good work only hearing what you did bad. Most sups have team favorites and if you aren't one you too will be micromanaged and made to feel like you aren't doing enough even if you do hit your metrics and when you don't they will try to get you out the door. I was consistently belittled by a sup, even for a good call, about things I did wrong in a non constructive manner. It was always \"Sure, they gave you a good score but..\" and they would rail into me about things I could have done for a superior experience. If a member called in and was upset, whether it be for hold time, being transferred, upset about a bill, ect. if they give you a bad score no matter how hard you tried to help it was your fault because no matter what 'you can always turn the call around'. I was told \"normally we don't keep people if they get a below meets expectations\" on a performance review for the year as a threat. Was consistently told that we need to do good because the sup is reviewed and received bonuses based off our metrics and if we didn't do good it wasn't because we needed help it was because we didn't care enough. A coworker wasn't doing the best but trying and instead of coaching and helping get better in other terms was told she would probably need to search for a new job. My team was threatened that if we didn't keep ACW (after call work) down she would quit doing the paperwork to get our bonuses and micromanage our ACW even if you averaged 70 seconds and the meets metric at least 30 seconds higher. Sup didn't know how to help us with our roles and was told \"I don't have to know, I'm a manger to manage you guys not take phone calls.\" but the sup was the one to grade your calls. I, like a few others who were switched to this team, finally left UHC. I had anxiety about coming to work I felt degraded and every time I received a message from my sup had a mini heart attack wondering what I did wrong this time even when I was doing the best I could. This job really isn't hard and can be laid back and rewarding when you can truly help the member. If you like to help people and are friendly you'll do just fine but the manager can make or break your experience."}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 May 2022", "job_title": "Customer Service Advocate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Remote, and team willing to help", "cons": "Resources to help customers are not there."}, {"review_title": "review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 May 2022", "job_title": "Aws/Devops", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexibility at work\ninternal certifications\nTeam work", "cons": "salary is very low\nno opportunities for developing skills"}, {"review_title": "Disorganization", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* supervisor \n* somewhat competitive pay", "cons": "*OT is very overwhelming \n* workforce will change your change your schedule constantly (everyday)\n* They open 24 hours, but the scheduling sucks.
