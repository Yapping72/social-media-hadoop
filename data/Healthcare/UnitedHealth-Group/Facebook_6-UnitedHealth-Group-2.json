They also hire management in the call center that lack poor leadership skills. Senior management makes decision that are out of line with how the customer service department works, for example we can only work 2 hours of overtime per day (management claims they made the change for better work life balance) but some people in the call center work 4 ten hour shifts and then overtime is added to their schedules. So I ask you were is the work life balance for a person that works that shift, you could be working anywhere from 10.5-12 hours a day. Don't get me started on the culture and values, they don't exist in the call center. The company pushes compassion but will give you an occurrence if you miss a day to go volunteer, but other departments can volunteer during there normal shift.

No, not a typo! Each monthly leadership call entailed bragging about how much money we were making (I worked for MEDICARE!!) while at the same time having to console crying members because they could not afford their $300+ premiums. That's when my conscience got to me. As a nurse, I felt like a traitor working for them and I will always feel that way. Also--I worked 50-60 hours per week and didn't get paid for 15,000 miles of mileage. Again, not a typo. I would not recommend this company to ANY NURSE. Oh and by the way, they replaced the field nurses with community health workers (no medical training--apparently UHC feels they are also above the law)."}, {"review_title": "Great benefits,  poor employee treatment", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay, time off, benefits, and retirement.", "cons": "Awful employee satisfaction.
