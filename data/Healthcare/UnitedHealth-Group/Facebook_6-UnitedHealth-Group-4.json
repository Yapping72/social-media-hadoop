Environment is ripe for making your mark and being a part of transformational change on many fronts. Exceptionally bright leadership that knows the industry and has driven growth, performance and changes that is a story largely untold--clouded by the media sensationalism around health care. UHG Is much more than a managed care organization, long ago intentionally positioned on a diversified platform for market volatility stabilization and to leverage its scale and expertise to lead change in many ways that get little attention despite the innovation and impact. The leaders of this company (led by Steve Hemsley) had insight decades back that was then and is now, truly sector changing. Their story is one to pause and spend time examining. It might not be a front runner in B school business cases because it's doesn't have that sector appeal that, say, retail does. But it should be. If you want to grow and be challenged ahead of your time and experience things many of your peers have not and may not--this is the place. Can be tough and intense--but because you are pushed to perform and be accountable. Big enough that the lazy can hide and grumble and complain wallowing in pity---for a while. They are always unearthed eventually. No org is perfect including United--some criticisms are legit I'm sure, but many--would simply say--knew the types and overall--their self election to move on to a more blas\u00e9 environment was probably a good move. Outstanding professional organization to flourish in.", "cons": "Phrase is: it depends. It's a huge place. If there is a con, it could be simply the person or team you work for--nothing more, nothing less. And if you perform, simply align with an advocate that can be a fan and have your back and move to another area. They encourage it and the choices are endless. IF---you deliver. It's action oriented and fast paced. Do what you say. Ask and challenged. Be thorough but not paralyzed. Well thought decisions are respected even if they don't work out as planned--it's the inattentive and disengaged \"don't get it factor\" types that get caught in the crossfire of intolerance for mediocrity.

Past bonuses were $4700, $7800 with the last one being $9,000. \r\n-Fast paced and you won't be bored if you are in the right position\r\n-In the product development side, if you really want to contribute and make change; the squeaky wheel works.

Compared to all other previous employers such as Kaiser; the plans they offer here are horrible. They are high deductible plans with even worse prescription coverage. They offer an HSA which they match but that's only because their plans are horrible to start with. Luckily for myself, I am relatively healthy. If I had a chronic condition or needed maintenance meds; I'd be broke. It is clear that the organization knows they need to keep premiums cheaper for non UHG employees and they stick us with the worst Insurance plans because employees don't have a choice. My husband's employer actually offers United Health insurance at a much better premium than what I as an employee is eligible for. That's shameful.  \r\n-One of the pros I mentioned was Optum is part of UHG which is a huge org. It is also a con in some ways because each department runs things differently. There is no cohesion or leveraging of the work. Some managers are very territorial of their department and are reluctant to work together. \r\n-I understand every position needs metrics in order to measure work. But this department measures the wrong things. The metrics they use are not always motivating to all its employees\r\n-Product development is fast paced and ever changing; which may not suit every person. Some employees want to do their minimum  and as much as I felt rewarded (with my annual bonus and positive reviews), it felt unfair when others were just mediocre\r\n-They depend heavily on offshore work with teams in India and the Philippines. This is a challenge. I think offshore work is appropriate in some type of work for example data entry. Data is Data right? The problems I have seen is when they trust offshore employees to use their reasoning and judgement to complete work that they don't have experience doing. When I have personally witnessed sub par work being done by an offshore team; I have gotten the impression it is not in my scope and to mind my business. \r\n-You have to come in at a decent salary. Once you get in; you won't be able to negotiate for a higher salary and the only way to make a more significant salary is to switch jobs.

Senior leaders are too busy looking at financials while directors and managers are too busy in their own work to deal with their direct reports\r\n\r\n- While the Technology Development Program (TDP) is a nice start for college graduates and new employees, it has some major flaws. As stated above, directors and managers are too busy in their own work to deal with \"TDPers\" and guide them in their careers. Also, Optum doesn't offer enough to TDPers to keep them at Optum because of what is out there in the market at other firms. It went from a program with a nice start and good intentions to a numbers game where it was just about flooding the company with \"tech-savvy millennials\" leading to many hungry college graduates sitting around with nothing to do, a lack of motivation, and no guidance.\r\n\r\n- Constant layoffs and changes in organizational structure. When I joined Optum, there had been massive company wide layoffs the year before and it was stable for about 2 years and then they had a year of massive hiring. Then after the 3rd year there were massive layoffs about every month. I was shocked that many senior leaders who had been in the company for 30+ years also got laid off (some of them were pioneers of amazing work at Optum/United). These layoffs caused alarm bells to ring throughout the company and put every employee on edge about their job.\r\n\r\n- Poor pay structure and employee review system. I guess the benefits like PTO and discounted health insurance make up for the pay structure somewhat however the market has much more to offer now that the company is not as stable as it used to be (in terms of job security). The employee review system is also highly flawed as it makes it very difficult for anyone to move up in paygrade due to unrealistic expectations from senior leadership and lack of guidance from management.\r\n\r\n- Projects and work were never stable. There would either be too much work for one person to handle or no work at all.\r\n\r\n- Old technologies and too many processes. Though this was slowly changing, Optum is still very far behind the competition and other tech firms out there\r\n\r\n- WFH allowance varied by department but it was mainly seen with a negative stigma by senior leadership."}, {"review_title": "WORST COMPANY TO WORK FOR - DO NOT WORK HERE OR YOU WILL REGRET", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Clerk in Costa Mesa, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nothing.

So many executives sit in their private offices and summon audiences to them without understanding how things work 2 or 3 levels down. You may need to apply for a role above your pay grade if you want a promotion; it's actually much easier than getting a promotion (thanks again to the finance bureaucrats). Bonuses come only once per year. They can be quite generous, but only really apply to what was in your manager's most recent memory of you, and they are highly discretionary in nature.

I wish I could be more negative, but really, UHG is so big everyone's going to have a different experience. But here's mine.  \r\n\r\nFrom what I saw, they put more attention on managers and decisions-makers than those who do the grunt work. And there are managers everywhere (it's managers all the way down). Your boss will spend more time looking up at his or her manager, making sure they approve, than down at their employees making sure they have what they need. They don't have to deal with IT problems when it takes days just to merge your two lines of code into master because of something eight levels removed. \r\n\r\nMy team was way too big for an Agile methodology. In-office developers alone, there were 24 of us. You can't have a stand-up meeting with that many people. And that's not counting QAs or BAs. The software is EXTRAORDINARILY complex and tightly coupled. The main branch often breaks because it's so tightly coupled so someone can easily commit something that breaks it for everyone. They adhere so tightly to Agile Scrum, but don't say \"no\" to the hard decisions (e.g. regularly booking way over capacity, two week iterations that don't improve the product, but make it so those managers know what to expect so they can tell their managers). Nothing is spelled out, there's operational knowledge in scattered people's brains everywhere.\r\n\r\nCreativity is not valued. By the time you get a spec to implement (which, good luck to know where your marching orders come from each day) it's been so finely tuned it's basically in pseudocode at that point. Their policies are dictated by out-of-touch managers six levels up. For example, no one has a personal space. You're expected to clear it off every end-of-day. This is so you can take your laptop anywhere to converse with others. Except A) most people need something of theirs to keep at their desk, like a keyboard rest or special chair or coffee mug B) you can't get to know anyone if they always sit in a different place. You only know them by names, not faces or location. How are you supposed to get to know anyone if you can't find them? So you end up using e-mail or IM for everything, even if they're right next to you.\r\n\r\nThey say they care about employees, but make no effort to make personal connections to them. I've been confronted with certain actions that were based entirely on hearsay evidence and the \"no one else seems to have a problem figuring this out\" deal. I've literally never had a conversation with my team leader (and I've had three in the 2 years I've been there. Four if you count having \"no manager\" for three or four months). And therefore I have no interest in pleasing that person.\r\n\r\nEverything is by e-mail. Policy changes, organization changes, team get-togethers, all by e-mail. A team lunch can have 23 people. How are you supposed to get to know anyone in that capacity? Every year they post a workplace survey, and bug everybody to complete it, but I've never seen anyone change based on it. I was on the survey team one year and I saw point after point ignored. They even said they ignore the comments.\r\n\r\nOther:\r\n-Open-plan office makes you feel anxious and watched. I always feel like my job is in peril. Lighting comes from skylights or dim flourescents, like a warehouse.\r\n-The free coffee is bad. I mean, it makes me sick. Makes me feel like there's a brick in my stomach. But you can always buy from their company coffee shop.\r\n-Lots of contractors and consultants. You never know who's who or when they're going to disappear. Goodbye subject matter experts.\r\n-Their technology policies are oppressive and dictatorial. They have an oppressive proxy you can't get around (meaning no YouTube, no Instagram, no Pinterest). You can't install any unauthorized software--they have a special program that monitors for it and an \"appStore\" that does all the installations from approved applications automagically. So if you like OpenOffice better than Word, you're out of luck. You're not allowed to use Chrome, you have to use IE or an old version of Firefox.\r\n-No advancement whatsoever.

The helpdesk supports 74000+ end users with 4500 different software applications. UHG through all sorts of mergers and acquisitions likely has every platform known to man - Unisys and IBM mainframes, every flavor of Unix, Windows servers, Cisco VoIP phones, Cisco VPN, etc. Last I heard the company processes 1 billion claims/year. This company probably has more data bandwidth collectively than many nations do. This is a heavy-duty factory of computing that cranks out a lot of product!\r\n- You handle something new and different everyday. Every day you learn something new or handle something new. It seems kind of daunting but is rather fun. This is a large company with every kind of discipline possible: claims processing, network management, underwriting, sales, IT, legal, advertising/marketing, finance, accounting, statistical analysis, doctors/nurses/counselors, etc. You will talk to people ranging from entry-level claims processors to Senior VPs in a given day. I learned a lot about all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes which makes a large health insurance company function. You can't learn every application there. But if you ask the right way most end users will happily explain how an application or process works. Some are simply glad that someone in the IT department wants to know more about what they do for a living. \r\n- Company is not going anywhere. This is a large, solid, dependable business. People will always need what they provide. Sure they have hiccups here and there depending on new healthcare legislation but this is a company with a lot of diverse businesses. And the helpdesk was insourced from a contractor a few years ago which many levels of IT management seem to be thrilled with.\r\n- The IT department generally seems well put together. Processes are well-designed, documented and executed. There seems to be a web form, tool or application for EVERYTHING. Very little done on paper or without automation.\r\n- 23 days of annual PTO to use. Days off granted on a first come, first served basis. \r\n- 99% of calls are from internal customers. You are very rarely dealing with the general public so you don't have to deal with people screaming in your face. Supervisors will generally defend you if there is a problem with a customer.", "cons": "- This office is the epitome of \"Office Space\". Everything is sterile, boring, soulless and in the middle of austere suburban surroundings. It is full of the same meaningless corporate cliches as you see in the movie. It doesn't feel like an IT department. You feel like you work in a customer service call center. You might as well sell magazine subscriptions. The people are boring and lifeless. Everyone and everything is so overly PC it is inhumane. There is very little social interaction. You are very unlikely to ever see your coworkers outside of work. If you do all they talk about is their little universe of resetting passwords for a living. All of the restaurants around this locale will fatten you up quick.\r\n- If you have any kind of personality this place will stifle you quickly and/or they show you the door in no time. They want \"yes men\" and quiet robots. Granted most of the corporate world is like that but this place brings that concept to the extreme.\r\n- There is little pride here. Someone else on Glassdoor said about UHG, \"There is no pride here. Everyone wishes they worked somewhere else. They are all here only to put this on their resume.\" How true. \r\n- If you like to use your natural creativity and tech-mindedness to solve interesting problems this place will burn you out fast. You very rarely get to delve deep into problems, your job mostly consists of writing tickets and sending the issues to workgroups. The company wants first-call resolutions but fails to let you do the work you need to do so. The company wants 8 minute resolutions to things that can't be done in 8 minutes. To some people - customers and management alike - all you are is a professional ticket-writer and are treated like such. \r\n- The lower and middle-level management are not very competent. Most of them have never done this kind of work and are not very qualified to tell you how to do your job. They often have very poor social skills, issues with communication and horrendous writing skills. They don't handle any kind of escalations and you can't go to them for help in the middle of a call.  All they really appear to do is tell you what you did wrong and gab amongst themselves while you have 40 calls in queue. They do their utmost to rub it in your face that they are a notch above you. I've rarely received any help from management types at this place. I am not saying this because I have some general dislike for management, in fact, I truly seek out managers whom I can respect and learn from. I didn't have one at this job. They are all a bunch of dead weight.\r\n- Supervisors try to mask their own incompetence through rampant micromanagement. If they can make some case that their employees are all incompetent and need to be continually managed then it makes them look superior and/or justifies their job. \r\n- Everything is about ridiculous sets of metrics. Everything. Again this goes back to the customer service vs. helpdesk issue. They care more about how long you were in a call than if you were able to do something to get this person up and working. Show up from lunch a minute late and they will complain about it. Go over 8 mins. in some call and a crazy supervisor will have a fit. They care more about call handling stats than people fixing problems. I always thought helpdesks fixed things.\r\n- EVERYTHING you do is recorded, both your phone audio and your screen video while in a call. It is so 1984 it is ridiculous. Call audio is one thing but the video is just to stalkerish for me. Never do anything that doesn't involve your job. I've never seen such a level of micromanagement. \r\n- Nobody talks to each other in person or on the phone in the office. It is all done through an instant messaging tool. Sometimes I need to talk to someone face to face. Don't get caught using the IM tool while in a call or you will hear about it. \r\n- You are chained to your desk the entire day. All you do is answer phone calls. You will forget what it was like to actually repair a computer. You will forget what it was like to walk. There is no face-to-face interaction. You will put on some pounds. \r\n- Your social interaction is all with people far away. West Coast, East Coast, Texas, down South, even India and the Phillipines. Let's just say you will meet a lot of nice folks but never ever get to have a drink with them. \r\n- The coffee in this place is the worst coffee that has ever existed. I don't see how it can be legally sold for human consumption. I understand it's free but the nearest real coffee stand is way too far to make it to on a break. \r\n- They will paint some bright portrait of career advancement. Get in the door and you will find out it was all a pipe dream. You may get out of there but only if you make absolutely ZERO waves and only if you treat your master exactly how they want to be treated. \r\n- UHG's health benefits, for being a HEALTH INSURANCE company, are pretty lousy. You could work at STARBUCKS slinging coffee and have better health insurance. \r\n- If you like learning what is happening in other parts of the company look in the newspaper. Granted the place is huge but I saw more current news about UHG in the newspaper business section than in my own internal communications.\r\n- Your CEO makes more in an hour than you will make in an entire year at this job. \r\n- Raises and bonuses are a joke. If you were \"lucky\" to receive a raise it was less than inflation. Bonuses? I made more in bonuses at manual labor jobs that I had in school than I did at this so-called \"professional\" job."}, {"review_title": "Be prepared to hit the ground running", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Aug 2011", "job_title": "IT Business Analyst in Minnetonka, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You have to quickly learn how to navigate through the organization's processes, and not to rely solely on your manager to set you up when you get on board (e.g. log in access to certain accounts, etc). So far my on-boarding has been better compared to my previous employers, where sometimes it takes a couple weeks just to get your workstation set-up and you have to pretty much stare into space during your first week of work because you don't have a computer. In my experience with UHG, my hiring manager pretty much had my basic workstation ready for use right on my first day.\r\n\r\nOn-boarding process is pretty easy, as you simply get access to a new hire website and it outlines what you need to do within the 1st week, month, and 90 days from your start date. I am pretty particular with that because it's the first few days of work that you typically have to do piles of paperwork and it's easy to miss something, plus I am not a fan of spending time faxing stuff out to HR. Most of the HR stuff is done online.\r\n\r\nAs far as being a new hire, it has been great, but you really should be able to hit the ground running, as they pretty much throw you in the middle of a project with little or no information at all, and you have to be proactive with a lot of things to keep up. I'm lucky I got a grasp on things when I got pulled into a project. There's still management engagement, and they provide whatever support they can give you (no micromanagement).\r\n\r\nDress codes range from business attire (suit & tie) to somewhat lower (collar, sleeves, slacks). Since I wasn't oriented with that I typically just assess what other people are wearing in the building and decide which is too casual. Definitely not a shirt-and-jeans environment. This is just for their main building, I guess because the executives reside there. It seems that for the other buildings, it's pretty laid-back. They don't have dress code marshals running around, though, so as far as I know as long as you look presentable, you're not going to be in trouble.\r\n\r\nThe have a high variety of the age range of the employees, which I like. And they are willing to hang out. I have had jobs where it's pretty much go-to-work-and-go-home type, as most of my teammates just up and leave when it hits end of workday for the most part. Here they have times where you either go for a happy hour with the team someplace nearby, or have lunch in a conference room just to chat - even for just an hour. And that's even when they're extremely busy. I appreciate that in the workplace - it makes me feel like I'm part of the team even if I am a newbie. And that motivates me to go to work everyday. They are pretty good at considering your time at work - they don't just throw meeting schedules on your calendar over lunch hours without checking with you. \r\n\r\nIt's too early yet to determine how the promotion/performance ratings are being done, so I'll leave that out for the next update.", "cons": "Cons are pretty superficial but I'm putting them here anyway...\r\n\r\nTheir buildings are pretty scattered - I came in a period where hundreds of constructions are going on in the area, so it is crazy trying to navigate between buildings when you have to (they do have an inter-office shuttle service, but still). Hopefully they'll start consolidating their departments into one building so it's easier. Plus, the main building's cafeteria is so much better.\r\n\r\nIt's not totally a Con, but it's pretty interesting that they don't really orient you firsthand on the dress-code policy, and other house-rules. I don't really care much for having these but I typically had to undergo some orientation about the dress-codes and stuff on my first day. The only orientation they have is more on the employee benefits, important company websites, information management/security policies, sexual harrassment, and insider trading.\r\n\r\nI know UHG is driving for \"being green\", but they need paper plates in their break rooms. Also, they need to work on stocking office supplies. I can't find even the humble push-pin in their stock bin - all I see are folders and printing paper. :)\r\n\r\nTheir websites need a bit more work because it was a tad confusing for a new hire to navigate through, but once you get used to it it's OK."}, {"review_title": "Clincal Management Admin.

My level gets 23 days per year, but that's sick and vacation time combined.\r\n-It's a steady paycheck in an unsteady economy.\r\n-Free hot chocolate, coffee, and personal products for women.\r\n-The insurance is cheap, but there is a large deductible.  However, it almost makes up for the difference in premiums.  Years ago before getting into healthcare I paid $200 per month for insurance for my children and myself and had a $500 deductible.  I have the cheapest policy available to my job grade and get the maximum wellness discount and pay about $50 per month with a $2950 deductible.  My rates are about $1800 less, but my deductible is $2450 higher.  However, we have an HSA and the company puts in $1000.  So, I'm paying about $350 less overall if I hit my deductible.  So the insurance isn't that bad if you take advantage of the HSA.  People complain about the insurance, but if you break it down it works out.", "cons": "-Most of my pros are cons as well.\r\n-Telecommuting is great, but if I call in sick I'm told I can work at home.  If I'm too sick to come in, I'm probably too sick to work at home.\r\n-Few people work 40 hours per week.  I work at night often and many times work until 2 am, and so do several of my coworkers.  Many hourly people work over 40 hours without overtime pay to get their work done.  The company doesn't force them to work for free, but they have too much work to do and are not allowed to get overtime.  So it's work over or get fired.\r\n-Get as much money going in as you possibly can, because raises and promotions have caps.  For example, the median pay for a level 26 in my area is about 62,000.  Let's say you are hired at a level 24 for 40,000.  The cap for each level increase is 5%, and raises are usually no more than 3%.  If you got a raise at 3% your new salary would be 41,200.  Then if you were promoted to a level 26 you would be making no more than 45,423.  That's nowhere near the average of 62,000, and it would take years of raises to get there.  Do your homework on salaries before accepting a job there, or you will soon be leaving to take a better paying job.  This leads up to my next point.\r\n-It's hard to advance in this company.  Due to the pay restrictions it's hard to get anywhere if you don't start out already up there.  This can also work against you.  I applied for a job exactly like mine at another location but was told I make more than they are willing to pay for the job.  It was the same level and job description, but I would have had to take a paycut.  Go figure that out.\r\n-Management does not communicate.  For example, I got a raise, but I only found out when I saw it on my paycheck.  My review consisted of an email with scores only and no verbiage.  We do not have team meetings or one-on-ones.\r\n-It's hard to get well if you get sick.  You can't take a few days off to get well without getting calls from work or being asked to work at home.This is a healthcare company, but they have to respect for employees when they get sick.  It can actually count against you, because the policy states \"Should an employee demonstrate excessive use of unplanned time off or an unacceptable pattern of PTO usage, the employee may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.\"  So although you may have 60 hours of PTO saved up, you could lose your job if you got sick too much and had to use it.\r\n-You can only carry over 40 hours of paid time off, and if you leave the company voluntarily you do not get paid for any accumulated time off.  If you are terminated you only get paid for 40 hours of accumulated time off.  But don't think you can turn in your notice and then use paid time off.  Once that resignation is in, you can't take any days off.  So if you think you're going to be leaving, use that time up or lose it.\r\n-This company is just too large to manage properly.  There is not one IT system where data can be retrieved from.  Data is all over the place, and there are different systems that do not interface with one another.\r\n-Very high turnover.  I have come to the conclusion they like it like that.  There is always someone out there who is willing to work for less money in this economy.

I was an Optum employee for around 3 1/2 years, full time and permanent.  I was the second person hired on to the team for which I worked.  I was a UI developer working on a project whose title I needn't disclose.  Towards the end of my time, all the UI work seemed to dry up and everything became heavy on the Java side of development.  Concerned for my position I asked my manager and was told, \"the UI work will come back in the form of a complete UI rebuild\" and I had nothing to worry about.  \r\n\r\nIn the downtime, I continued to learn new technologies that would make me more useful to Optum, so when the UI work came back I could hit the ground running.  About a month later I was laid off.  The reasons I was given were \"budget cuts\" and \"lack of UI work\".  When I inquired about the UI rebuild work that same manager told me  \"it's not happening\" and \"I just don't know\".   Fast forward a month or two later and I find out that the UI work DID in fact return and I also found out that Optum had onboarded a bunch of college grads and new TDP kids.  Lack of work?  Budget cuts?  No.  I was lied to and was let go for no justifiable reason.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is this.  Despite how upper management touts about how Optums first priority is its people, they certainly are not.

That said, from my experience, if you can't think for yourself and need your hand held by your manager, Optum is the job for you. Micromanagement is the name of the game where I work. You may have otherwise proven yourself perfectly competent but always remember that your manager knows best and will see to it that you do everything you are supposed to do and when it is supposed to be done and that it is done their way! Instead of outlining tasks and giving employees accountability for seeing to it that these tasks are completed accurately and within a timely manner, you are subjected to micromanagement on various levels. And as far as vacation goes, UHG is very generous in my opinion. But local PTO policy leaves much to be desired. They have made so many rules as to when you can and can\u2019t use PTO, such as limiting the time you are able to take off during summer months. And they have twice within the last 18 months put a block on any new PTO requests during certain time periods because of upcoming training. Training and meetings are one of the most important things to local Optum management. The majority of my coworkers work in the field. The local office is not our \u201coffice\u201d and long drives to the local corporate office coupled with hours in a meeting makes patient management difficult. Despite that fact, mandated meetings in person at the local office are frequent and, when considering what information was given to you at the meeting, oftentimes longer than necessary. Much of the information does not require in-person attendance. I'm not sure why they even bother putting the actual word \"mandatory\" in the meeting notification\u2014it goes without saying. Local management is aware of various technology available to them for information dissemination and the creation of a learning environment that works for all, but they apparently refuse to embrace this technology. Instead they insist on wasting reams of paper (and expensive ink), gallons of gas getting to an often distant office, the cost to corporate for mileage to and/or from the office just to tell us things that could be told via email, powerpoint or webex or a myriad of other medium.

If you work with many veterans of uhg/optum then don't count on getting a bonus unless more are hired on. \r\n\r\nApparently leadership feels the need for every department to place 25% of it's team on the bottom feeder, aka not meeting expectations, even if one or more of those 'poor performers' met all key project deliverables, received only positive reviews and an NPS average of 10.  Since department managers are forced to 'select' poor performers, you would be better off being joining a team of mediocre performers IF you are a high performer yourself.

But all the other company in the same tech park don't have any parking space problem. If I go and check parking lot for other company, most of the time it will be have lot of space.

Even if the employee was 51 miles away (and in the Philadelphia area it is not uncommon to live 50+ miles from the office due to so many suburbs).

I am an experienced Registered Nurse and began my time with UHC/Optum thrilled to have a work-from-home position specifically for the flexibility and independence. I met with one of the managers at the Maryland Heights, MO location and LOVED her. As time went on, I found myself compromising A LOT and feeling like I was in a bad marriage. As mentioned previously, I wanted the flexibility. When I first started, I was told I would have three weeks of training, which turned into nine weeks. This was frustrating for me as I have many other commitments outside of work, and by the time I actually had things communicated to me, I was already too invested. Had I have known this, I would have never taken the position initially.\r\n\r\nTraining was 8-5 M-F and was inflexible. Then, on a Friday, we were told training would be 7a-3p the following Monday to accommodate someone who worked on the East coast. Here I was to be flexible, yet had to change around my schedule completely without advanced notice. The nine weeks of training was then pointless as UHC did a bait-and-switch and split the class up into \u00bc nurse triage and \u00be nurse triage and insurance. Did I mention we then had a new manager? This happened at the end of training\u2026again, once we were all invested. Being flexible, once again, I kept a positive attitude and began taking the phone calls. The calls ranged from \u201clet me transfer you to member services\u201d to \u201clet me explain the donut hole.\u201d I knew I was not a member service representative, but I still kept going because I told myself nurses can help people get to where they need to go, right? I was yelled at, ridiculed, and maybe received 20 total triage calls from members when I worked there for five months. Not to mention, more skills were added which included Medicaid patients who I needed to transfer to Medicaid customer service. How is this nursing when 75% of calls were transferred to another department and members were not being cared for at all? \r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no flexibility. If you needed to leave the desk for 5-10 minutes, you would receive a very passive aggressive group email reminding everyone of the telecommuter rules. Where is this so-called flexibility? We were chained to our desks for 8 or 10-hour shifts.\r\n\r\nNow for the independence. We were watched constantly. Our group jabber was watched by someone at all times to ensure we were doing our jobs since we were Registered Nurses with licenses and could not be trusted. Let\u2019s talk about the value that was added to our role since we are one of the most trusted professions out there. We can save lives, but, at UHC, we have to be watched. Talk about an invasion of privacy and feeling devalued. \r\n\r\nMy favorite part was when we had a meeting about a survey we were coerced into answering positively as this was how management was paid their bonus. We heard that on particular questions, \u201cwe were never given less than 100%\u201d, so if we do now, that makes us look bad. Talk about being desperate for your bonus. \r\n\r\nAfter all is said and done, I decided it was best for me to part ways. I received a phone call days later from my so-called \u201cManager\u201d who asked what UHC could do for me. I was told that he would work with upper management to make this happen because I was so well-liked and \u201cone of their best new-hires.\u201d I waited an entire week for an email and instead received a box in the mail to return my things. No explanation. No email. No \u201cI am sorry.\u201d No exit interview. Nothing. I then wrote a second email asking him to explain what was going on and still no response. Then, I emailed my former manager who obviously knows what is going on there who must have forwarded my email to him. He then got back to me right away with this email:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u201cShipping boxes and labels have been ordered and will be arriving at your residence for you to send all equipment back in. An email was sent Monday with this information included, I apologize if you did not receive it. If you have any questions, please contact me.\u201d\r\n\r\nYet another bait-and-switch with UHC. No word about me staying there. No apology. Nothing.

I've yet to see any positive outcomes from VS-just a bunch of empty promises, \"yeah, we'll get a committee together and work on that for next year.\" Great-just what we need;  ANOTHER meeting fixing YOUR management probems (it's always the employees who have to be on these committees). Sometimes they actually do fix the problem, but most the questions are so vague, it's difficult to fix anything significant. \"Do you like upper management\" (or some form of that question).

Management expects employees to know vast amounts of information and use up to 15 programs on a call with a customer.  Of course that call better be short and accurate and pleasant and everything else.  It can be draining when you're expected to field anywhere from 60 - 120+ calls in a day.  On top of that, customer service reps are expected to keep abreast of updated programs, policies, procedures, medical technology and medical terminology \"between calls.\"  Oft times, there is no between call time.\r\n\r\nExpect less than stellar vacation time, frequent schedule changes and possibly mandatory overtime.  Time off is bidded on based on seniority, performance in various areas and sometimes just on being a \"pet\" of your manager.  An employee may be exceeding their metrics and goals but will probably not get the time off they ask for - even if you ask for it months in advance.  Bidding is done several times a year and is basically a circus.  Employees are basically punished for not exceeding performance goals (even if you're meeting all goals and show up on time, etc. and have no write-ups or warnings you can and probably will be bumped to a worse schedule if you are not exceeding in most if not all areas.  Favoritism is rampant.  If you're exceeding all your metrics then you're making your manager look good - you're also contributing to their bonus.  If you're maybe not hitting in all performance areas then you'll bring down your manager's bonus and that tends to make them not like you.  Or maybe they just like you for whatever reason (going to the same church seems to be a big asset).  In that case you'll probably get preferential treatment (access to promotions and perks).  I've been on both sides of this - this is not at all professional and possibly unethical.  Overtime is often mandatory.

Where to start?  \r\n\r\nOn the macro level:\r\nSince being acquired by UHG, the company has dropped all pretenses of caring about employees.  From ridiculous office relocations to mass layoffs despite a hugely profitable year (seriously, $100 million+ in the black, as they so proudly keep relaying to us while simultaneously handing out more pink slips), the upper management has made it clear that their mission is to shed employees through attrition so they can avoid the bad press and severance costs associated with further layoffs.  There is also a disgusting amount of corporate doublespeak.  Despite the fact that the company fired a great number of employees and then rehired international teams at lower wages to do the same jobs, oh no, it's NOT outsourcing--it's \"building a global team.\"  Getting an answer or an internal policy change from middle/upper management is like getting an act of Congress.  They are sluggish and unresponsive to a changing market, and the upper echelons are just business drones who clearly are there to wield an axe for cost-reduction when a surgeon's scalpel is called for.\r\n\r\nOn the micro level:\r\n-Training was largely insufficient.  It's often left in the learner's hands to know which questions to ask, which is a recipe for disaster.\r\n\r\n-The corporate structure is extremely convoluted, so it takes several years of experience just to know which department to go to with an issue.  It's not uncommon to get an email that's been forwarded literally 5 or 6 times between managers while they're just looking for the right department to handle something, so issues can occasionally go unchecked for long periods.  (This is exacerbated by the sluggishness of upper management which was previously described.)\r\n\r\n-As part of the above issue, work is distributed extremely unevenly between teams.  Some teams will be struggling to keep the tide at bay while others are twiddling their thumbs for 2 weeks straight.  Projects can almost always be chopped up and divided, but the middle managers don't seem to have a grasp of the systems in place well enough to do so efficiently.  Great ideas about workflow redistribution are sent to \"committee hell\" and essentially pocket vetoed.\r\n\r\n-Related to workload, there is a strict performance metric system that breaks down everything you do into a quantifiable chunk, and this affects your performance reviews and quarterly bonuses.  This fundamentally discourages employees from going above and beyond in any task, because no matter how well you do something, you'll only get X amount of time for it.  Also, your mileage may vary on this point, but I found it existentially disturbing to have everything I do compressed into a context-free numeric percentage goal of a target, without regard for the quality of my output.  If you're the robotic cerebral type, you might find this refreshing--you will always know exactly how far ahead or behind you are compared to expectations... but if you like to really dig into projects and take care of details (like I do), this system can be absolutely maddening.\r\n\r\n-There is occasionally a weird obsession with rank and structure, so it feels a little like a cliquey high school at times--\"Ugh.  Becky, will you remind Andrea to tell Samantha that I'm totally NOT talking to her right now?\"  If you email a person directly when you should have gone somewhere else in the chain, that person won't reply to your email; they'll forward it to their supervisor, who forwards it to YOUR supervisor, who sends you a Bill Lumbergh-ian email (yeah, Office Space reference, but it's appropriate here) gently reminding you of the chain of command.

I was directed by a bad leader but when I told others who worked in different areas what I went through, they were surprised because their team was not like that, they had more flexibility.

UHG did have some fun after work events and when we had long office meetings, food was provided. We were taken to lunch on occasion. We attended a Twins game in a suite. They had an annual two day off-site cabin forum.", "cons": "Hiring process was a little much- takes about 1-2 months. I had phone interviews with a CA recruiter, a digital interview, calls with a MN recruiter, then finally two in-person interviews. The acceptance package was never explained, just given a lot of paperwork, links, etc to figure it out. They never had a formal orientation. I spent my first day pulled into conference calls and meetings, instead of getting building tours, familiar with my team and surroundings. There is no on-site IT support, you call someone if you need help. I had to set-up my computer, phone, email, etc. I was never taught how to use the HR website for benefits, goals, etc. I figured it out on my own. Parking isn't the best. They needed more on-site parking. You need to be there by 8am to get parking in their ramp otherwise you are in ramp across the road and walk or take shuttle. Benefits, especially health insurance options aren't that great for a health insurance company. Don't offer basic insurance PPO options, just high cost HSA's. They had a 4 hr PTO policy even for salary EE's so if you had 45+ hours in by Friday at noon and wanted to leave you still had to take 4 hrs PTO. The biggest flaw UHG had with my experience was what I went through. I was sought out by a recruiter. I was in a good job with a good company and leader and I had flexibility. Before I went in for a second interview, I told the hiring manager I was working from home two days a week and that I needed to know what their WFH policy was. I told her work-life balance was important to me and that I didn't want to waste her or I's time. Her response was it'd be worth my while to come in so I did. They knew my current flexibility and said they offer this too and that their teams work from home. I got into the job 4-6 months later to find out there was no formal WFH policy. Some teams worked from home 1-2 days and others more. There was no consistency. When my kid's summer schedule hit, I revisited my two days WFH to be told it should only be one. Then when I wanted a consistent one day a week from home just during the summer, I was told it would need to be determined weekly. The job posting indicated no travel and it was not disclosed to me during the interview or hiring process but our team did travel to clients when needed. My team worked through lunches and even while on PTO. There were constant meetings, mostly internal or development meetings but it did take away from my actual day-to-day work. I spent most of my weeks in meetings or on conferences calls. I had 1-1 meetings with four different leaders and it was confusing because my direct boss would be good with something but someone higher would say otherwise so I never knew whose direction to take, again a lot of inconsistency and poorly managed teams. When I resigned I wasn't told they didn't have to pay out my PTO balance and they didn't. They were also supposed to take my HSA balance out of my final check but didn't. They told me it was mine to use but two months later I got a bill from UHG. They never sent me an exit interview or survey. My BEST ADVICE to someone considering employment with UHG is to get employment details such as WFH arrangement and schedules, travel, hours or busy seasons outlined in the offer letter because they will not disclose this information and will trick you into taking the job because they feel they have more to offer to you than what is truly most important to you."}, {"review_title": "great, until it isnt", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Dec 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great direct coworkers, you might get lucky with a highly involved manager who doesn't micromanage you and will be a true steward leader.\r\n\r\nRoom for growth outside and inside growth with the team I was on.", "cons": "The cut positions around the end of year holiday time.

My end of the 6-12 month project would require verifying Parent Company associations - by any means of internet research possible. \r\n\r\nTo help you understand the importance and complexity of my end of the project - Ingenix had contracted to pay roughly $12,000 per month for my professional services.\r\n\r\nThere was no set method of research. Ingenix described the job as \"highly ambiguous\". It was essentially looking for needles in haystacks - but, Ingenix couldn't even tell where the haystacks were. They are in the middle of database migration - and their database has been contaminated by errant  and outdated information.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:  Learn three fairly complex software programs from scratch, learn how to apply these programs to Ingenix's project needs. Again, there was no \"official\" way to conduct the research - it was locating random company associations from random internet sources ranging from corporate websites to business directories to business news blurbs.\r\n\r\nTRAINING: No project trainer onsite. Training was conducting via telephone and desktop sharing from 2,000 miles away - I kid you not!\r\n\r\nRESULT: A mere TEN DAYS into the assignment (while my colleague and I were still receiving training) - I get a phone call from the Project Manager (again, from 2,000 miles away) - ending my services on the grounds that I wasn't \"getting it quick enough\". NO advanced warning, nor indication that anything was amiss in their minds. NOTHING. \r\n\r\n\"Not getting it\"? I'd done database analysis for Boeing 747 jet aircraft! This was a sick joke. Ingenix brings in a professional to do a professional's job - and then treats him with the disregard too often afforded an entry-level file clerk. I have been a project manager, so it is not with some level of expertise that I assert - this project manager was operating outside of her element.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Ingenix turns Unrealistic Expectations into an artform. They create a database disaster - then they expect a professional analyst to come in, learn three software programs and the complex tasks of the job - in 10 days - with training via telephone from 2,000 miles away. \r\n\r\nIf you are considering a career move, ask yourself this: \"How well would I fare at Ingenix, given the same paradigm?\".

Balance is essential. They wish for us to be innovative but often reject suggestions unless they come from a sort of \"inner circle\" of employees that is created in the office. The company itself promotes diversity of all sorts, but middle management is unacceptable of different personality types rather than finding value of extroverts and introverts alike.\r\nWork life balance is also very difficult. It's like a fight to get days off. It doesn't help that the turnover rate is so high in my location. We have only half the representatives from a year ago but are given even more work. With such a high turnover the company should consider exit interviews, but they do not. This is another example of them refusing to take responsibility of issue as they continue to make themselves ignorant of persisting problems.\r\nThe micromanaging is so overwhelming. It bogs down work time and damages morale. The micromanaging is so intense that middle management will even go as far as to time people in the restroom and sit them down to suggest to them to shave a minute off their time away from the desk. It is highly inappropriate.

She claimed after I started that she would be an advocate for me when in fact she was anything but.  I constantly had to go to her for work, and remind her of training requests I needed approval on.  Furthermore, she scheduled me for projects that she wasn't even sure of.  Feedback was mostly critical/negative rather than constructive and often merely based on hearsay and anecdotal which from a manager is taken as gospel.  While there are resources on HR Direct like LearnSource where you can chart your development, management is extremely critical of everything you do so unless they approve of you, you will not succeed in the department.  This can be challenging since managers often communicated poorly if at all to m.  For instance, roles and responsibilities of various staff members are not clear or updated anywhere for staff to see and managers did not communicate these expectations to me until it was too late.  Some managers have different expectations so that complicates matters further.  Without this communication and coaching from management I often felt sabotaged instead of empowered.  What I learned in time was that managers delegate most of the roles and responsibilities they are listed as responsible for on that document online downward and Leads do it as well often without telling their team.  Turnover is quite high and one director seemed proud of that as she boasted that many staff don\u2019t last six months while complaining how hard it is to fire people.  Managers excel at negative feedback and seemingly would rather get rid of staff than develop them or they lack the skills to develop them.  I had to constantly bring up examples of my contributions since managers will either minimize or ignore any and were all too ready to detail my weaknesses/faults which were not tied to any data/metrics and had little impact on the project.  Worse yet, managers are arrogant and overconfident in their leadership abilities and seem to be above reproach as they are consistently rewarded and praised by senior leadership.  Most of the department training is trivial and lacks practicality.  Since feedback is such a big part of the department and staff are so poor at giving it that should be a focus of training.  A big part of feedback is supporting it with documentation of examples rather than hearsay/subjective statements.  The feedback would be a lot more credible and constructive if it outlined strengths as well as weaknesses (balanced).  Concise, constructive, balanced and timely feedback was the exception rather than the rule as management lack the skills to consistently provide this.  Therefore, feedback was employed as a tool to knock an employee down by cherry picking those incidents that fit a narrative.  My manager revisited past performance reviews to solicit negative feedback on me despite it being my first project.  She even questioned the experience on my resume which was interesting since during my actual job interview she had no questions.  She then told me that she knew I requested more balanced feedback from her boss which made it more probable that retaliation was a motive.  She and the VP who was with her at the time should have given me kudos for bringing this to senior management\u2019s attention since unlike them my feedback was valid, constructive and factual.  I used to audit offices with similar cultures so I can identify the symptoms of such a toxic work environment.  During my time in the department my intent was to help them meet their objectives and identify and mitigate risks that could have a negative impact.  In my experience management posed the biggest such risk to the department\u2019s success as they only seemed to care about their own interests."}], [{"review_title": "Managerial Leadership program is a joke", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "21 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in West Valley City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Upper management and up is great.

You will immerse yourself in what we do and most importantly, you will assist our patients.  Which will take time from you being home. There are those that simply do their 9 to 5, but as for myself? I want to just keep going.  It can be stressful to some, who are not focused on the goal....The goal is to make out patients feel as if we are the answer to what issues they may have financially.  Educate our patients as they go through a stressful enough process regarding why they're there in the first place, on healthcare insurances and their respective coverage's. Everyone is different, and I strive to treat and assist each one according to their unique needs and questions. I sometimes don't know when to go home.  Well, they systems do require daily maintenance, and I am forced to log off and go home, so there is a time limit set. Even when I want to keep going.  If you're like me, already paid your dues in corporate america and want to help others, this company is for you. My wife understands my drive, so she is ok with it, but if you simply take the job for a paycheck, then this isnt for you. You MUST care about heaping others. If its all about you, and what you can get out of it, you will be found out, and thats where you will get stuck."}]]
