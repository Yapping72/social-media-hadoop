Therefore it's important to highlight the team I was working for \u2013 \u201cWorkforce Effectiveness- Industrial Engineering\u201d. \nThe team has been marketed as the name itself. However, in reality, under the current leadership, we cannot even achieve any level of effectiveness within ourselves, let alone help the customers. \nMost of the leaders are big talkers with almost no action. The leaders can manage to use their big words to create the illusion of success to fool outsiders. But behind closed doors, it\u2019s a totally different story. They are constantly looking for opportunities to drag the other team members down and are proud of themselves being able to point out the smallest grammar error in an email instead of collaborating effectively on things that are remotely close to industrial engineering. And they call it \u201ccareer development\u201d. \n\nThe leadership never owns up to mistakes and issues. They constantly throw their hardworking frontline engineers under the bus even in front of clients and blame them for whatever went wrong. There is no useful coaching, guidance or feedback from the leadership and the frontline engineers are doing the same no brain work day in and day out for the past 5 years since the team established. They established strict protocols even for how you should write your email and you are expected to be a robot to follow it from day 1. If you raise concerns, especially against the privileged few in the leadership team, you may get fired citing \"culture misfit\". \n\nIt\u2019s very frustrating that it is nearly impossible to get a direct and clear answer to any question you ask. The Director of the team constantly use the phrase \"blue collar mentality\" and \u201cthink big\u201d to avoid all sorts of questions, from how we should work with customers to what new skills the team should adopt. People in this team should not have their own thoughts but blindly follow what they are being told by their leads. \nIronically, when engineers do \u201cthink big\u201d and try to learn and integrate new technologies such as programming and machine learning to the projects, they get no motivation and directions from the leadership. The same vague answers come out again. Any time when engineers are talking technical topics, it becomes the time when the leaders actually stop talking.\nThere has been no clear vision for the team. In the past few years, the team has deteriorated into a service desk, miles apart from the dream of being an engineering team and making a difference. This has completely ruined the motivation for a lot of workers. As the result of that, people kept leaving the team in the past few years. \n\nI can safely say that the only substantial thing engineered by the team in the last one year is this review. The leadership promotes incompetent people who do excellent in the quantity of \u201cspeaking up\u201d while the ones who actually work and try are not rewarded with challenging work or better financial benefits. Besides, the team leader also think they are overpaying people when in average the team is at least 20k below the market price. With bad leadership, no motivation and no financial benefits, it\u2019s hard to see any future for this team."}, {"review_title": "Decent place to work, but the benefit options are bad.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Dec 2008", "job_title": "Project Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexibile work schedule and work at home opportunities.

Not terrible, not great, regardless of performance. See Cons for notes about raises.", "cons": "-Every aspect of the corporate infrastructure is abysmal. The laptops are slow, despite having decent specifications, and you will spend an ungodly amount of time fighting basic things like getting access to WiFi in conference rooms, getting necessary software licenses (e.g., Telerik, Resharper), addressing overly onerous web filters for even basic and necessary sites to do your job, etc. This aspect has hardly improved over the years and is a permanent feature of the organization.\r\n-As if that wasn't bad enough, the IT support is universally terrible and actively detrimental. On-site IT is lifted straight out of a Mike Judge comedy, while the help desk is akin to calling your ISP for help. Expect to be on hold a lot and be ready to lose days of productivity on minor issues.\r\n-The management isn\u2019t much better. You may speak to your direct boss on occasion, but critiques are not welcome and will be ignored. Management further up the food chain are nonexistent as they tend to hole themselves up in their offices. They often choose not to even show up to the office, and there\u2019s high attrition rate of middle management, with each new manager having a slightly new way of doing things.\r\n -So much of the technology stack is old and crusty. Despite the job descriptions they put out, you will not be working on anything remotely new (think Silverlight until 2020), and plans to leverage any new technologies are just that \u2014 plans \u2014 and they will never come to fruition.\r\n-Honestly, the codebase is among the worst I\u2019ve ever seen in any professional environment, and attempts to address the issue are either wholly ignored or given token lip service. Refactoring is a four letter word and the only architectural design pattern that is properly implemented is the Big Ball of Mud.\r\n-Incompetent offshore. Talented offshore resources certainly exist, but they do not work for this organization. The overhead in communication and coordination only makes things worse. However, because some executive higher up loves the budget savings on paper, offshore is effectively untouchable. To a fair degree, onshore is basically supporting offshore, and you will likely be asked to train them on the most basic of skills, even though they should already have had those skills or should be able to, at a minimum, learn a good bit of it on their own.\r\n-The development methodology is Agile in name only. Teams change every few months, with little consideration to whom works well with whom. The rate at which talent leaves only ensures team arrangements are fairly fluid. Assigning points to stories is moot, since timelines for features are decided and set in advance.\r\n-There may be one product divided across three or four geographically dispersed teams, or more. This is generally a byproduct of non-integrated acquisitions built up over time, and there is no attempt to actually integrate teams. This leads to needless complexity, which carries over into the codebase, where there is no shortage of duplicate models across teams, endless data ping-pong back and forth, etc. \r\n-Even worse, there\u2019s zero accountability on any level \u2014 it\u2019s borderline impossible to get fired, even for basic things like showing up to work.On those rare occasions where there is accountability, it\u2019s often aimed at the very people who speak up about issues that prevent them from making the organization and product better.\r\n-Remuneration/pay is decent, but pay raises are a joke. Even in good years and at the top end of the raise scale, you\u2019ll be lucky to get a raise that keeps pace with inflation. This basically means you\u2019re closer to a wage cut than an actual raise, and that\u2019s if you\u2019re good. And that's in the *good* years, when the money is rolling in (just not to you).\r\n-Really, really terrible benefits, especially the health and vision insurance.\r\n-If you like working in a stale cube farm where, at its most exciting, managers will conduct interviews on speaker phone next to you, you're in the right place."}], [{"review_title": "Busy Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Richardson, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits and the pay were decent.

High deductible (over $4,000) before *any* coverage kicks in. Co-pay? Nope, all office visits are 100% on you until you reach your deductible, then they cover a percentage. And for that you pay upwards of $300 a month to insure your family. Yes, you read that right - $300 a month for the right to pay the first $4K.

In my initial review, I praised the company for many things... some of those remain true.  The PTO package is still good, better than I would have expected... however, they've moved to a use it or lose it policy.  I've gotten married since, the health insurance is relatively expensive to cover my significant other and myself.  The HSA sucks, because you're basically handing a portion of every paycheck right back to Optum.  Clear conflict of interest there.  \r\n\r\nCST's new building is decent... Large, ample parking, top floor off Swedesford Road in Malvern.  Even less places to eat nearby than in Newtown Square.  That sucks.  I worked from home full-time, though, so that won't concern you if you're interested in a work-from-home position.  I do have to say that working from home full-time is amazing.  I only went into the office three times in 6 months prior to being promoted.\r\n\r\nThe pay levels are decent... $15.14 to start in CST as a case coordinator, you get approximately a $1.50 or so raise if you make Lead coordinator ($12 a day and you have to go into the office?  Barely covers gas.).  CST Supervisors make ~$45k.  You can make more as a coordinator with overtime.  Managers have a nice jump in pay levels, but I don't have specifics on that.  The night shift differential is +10%.  You have your choice of 1 hour or 30 minute breaks, but they push you heavily towards 30 minutes.", "cons": "You are a slave to the ever-rising production quotas.  If you don't hit the quota, you either get a small bonus or none at all.  Doesn't matter if the whole team is slow, you are expected to hit 26 a day in CST.  As a supervisor, your bonuses are based on the production of your employees and reviews by your manager.  Long story short, they're gonna suck if your employees don't carry their weight.  Repercussions for not hitting productivity include Corrective Action Plans, or CAP's as they are called, and if you get one, you get no bonus that quarter.  It's silly because it eliminates all incentive to work hard.  CAP's also apply to other things, it's the third level of disciplinary measures that EHR employs.  Verbal warning, written warning, then CAP, then termination.  I will say it is tough to get a CAP, although that depends on your supe/manager, really.\r\n\r\nWork environment is boring at home.  It's even worse in the office, which is sterile.  No office decorations allowed.  No private cubicles, you're always with others in \"squares\" of four.  Only managers get offices, many sit vacant.  Supervisors are also in cubicles.  Morale is very low.  Employee interaction is minimal as management doesn't like that.  I'm sure they'd chain you to your desk if it wasn't illegal.  Case Managers complain constantly via phone, they're impossible to satisfy.\r\n\r\nCommunication between teams is horrible, between shifts as well.  There are differing policies for days and nights, even though they share clients.  Shift times overlap creating a dead period at the end of the day shift and beginning of the evening shift.  The trainers are ineffective.  New hires are \"trained' and then have to be retrained on half the stuff they \"learned\" because they constantly do things wrong.  Quality greatly suffers because it is sacrificed to meet quotas.\r\n\r\nRumbles of unionization are there.  The grunts are dissatisfied and it is painfully obvious. Declining pay, rising expectations, and increased focus on and threats of discipline and layoffs from management destroy morale on a daily basis.  Some supervisors do their best to lift spirits, but to no avail.  I would not place any blame on the case coordinators for unionizing because they are treated like robots, not humans.\r\n\r\nFringe benefits, like tuition reimbursement, are difficult to get.  For example, if you want to be a nurse, they won't pay for it because they couldn't hire you after graduation, as they require clinical experience.  Pre-med?  Yeah right.  If you want to go into IT, it has to be a field they have a business need for.  At $5k a year, it isn't much of a benefit, but better than nothing.  They flat-out declined to cover any expenses related to a Human Resources degree.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned by others, bonuses are now tied to overall company growth performance.  So you pay for the failures of other departments in terms of customer retention and acquisition.  It doesn't matter how well you perform as an individual if the rest of the company doesn't do their job properly.\r\n\r\nConflicts of interest galore!  There are several instances where certain individuals are supervised by their family members, significant others, lifelong friends.  Cronyism is a serious issue not only within my former department, but within the company as a whole.\r\n\r\nHIPPA violations are a dime a dozen.  The only ones reported involve outgoing paperwork/emails/faxes.  Nothing internal is ever reported unless it's very serious.  General security measures are lax at best, internal controls are nonexistent.\r\n\r\nThe IT situation is better than it used to be, but still pretty poor.  The IT department is constantly overwhelmed.  Most tickets take hours or days to get an answer for unless it is related to productivity or core job functions.  Then it might only take an hour to be fixed.\r\n\r\nHoliday PTO is tightly controlled.  You have to request what days you want off 6-8 months in advance.  So if your family doesn't plan anything until October-November like mine, you're SOL.  You can only roll over 40 hours of PTO per year.  So if you aren't big on long vacations, you basically lose money in the form of PTO every year.  There is a huge rush to take remaining PTO in November/December, and availability is limited; people get screwed.\r\n\r\nYou also have to work every other weekend, and two holidays a year, out of Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years... that's right, Easter isn't a holiday!\r\n\r\nRaises are nonexistent unless you are promoted.  Promotions are rarely handled based on competence, they are usually based on who you know. Time after time, I've seen highly productive employees passed over for the \"cool\" kids in the office... Key words, \"in the office.\"  You will never get promoted if you work from home full-time unless you work nights.  \r\n\r\nNo overtime allowed without explicit permission.  There is more, too, but I only have 5000 characters."}, {"review_title": "Great company - great opportunity!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 Nov 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Bright, fast-paced co-workers!

Strategy of hiring of a leader is very tactical they hire a fool down the stack & below one an intelligent & below that a fool(stack continues till bottom). The first fool hired is supposed to be part of extended leadership who would just follow the boss order (thereby the leader[so called] secures his position no threat for his chair) &the fool can never dream of climbing up as he does not possess any skill to be there neither he can practise to be one. The intelligent down does all the junk work & gets frustrated when raises a concern he is commented on being senior but cannot delegate anything down as there is another fool who is hired by his manager (the first fool).  This is an excellent strategy which is being followed, not sure if the organization can build any culture like this (Trust me I can share names & functions for the whole organization)\r\n2. Pathetic management & leadership - probably guidelines wont allow me to post, can name individuals. [infact naming is not required when all are same]\r\n3. No culture of the organization, any leader (as described above) can make or break ur life. Offcourse u have the option to change the company, i will not comment anything on this.\r\n3. U think out of the box - u r criticized.

No HR system, u have partners :) who will only show their face during specific period. They dont know how to act on anything, again they r hired by leaders to follow. Poor guys probably their hands are also tied - what more disgusting this can be when an employee tries to reach with a concern & that is never looked. I have 30+ cases which i can report out in such a short stint.\r\n5. Compensation is good & will only increase when u r pet follower of ur boss\r\n6. There is a measurment criteria of the organization (will not name that) by default they are at some great % inspite of unhappy & unsatisfied employees [can comment only in IT not sure in ops]\r\n7.

Promises made to people are never fulfilled, tricks & tricks & tricks is the only mantra\r\n9.

They refer you to typed documents if you have questions. If you mess something up because of this there's he** to pay.\n\nLiterally impossible to get another position unless you know someone. There is no room for advancement-good work is rewarded with more work and requests that you work overtime. \n\nEveryone is a terrible person because they hate working their job so much. EVERYONE. When I worked in the office there was at least one panic attack a week from someone, and a lot of people are on leave for stress. \n\nMeetings. You're held to strict productivity schedules, yet, you're forced to sit in HOURS of weekly meetings that do absolutely nothing. They don't adjust productivity due to this. \n\nThe job itself is busy work and getting yelled at by management, customers, and providers. It's not a call center but you're expected to take calls that come in.\n\nFinally, they have installed tracking systems on computers that keep track of idle time, who you're talking to and how long, what websites you're going to, and click counts. Total invasion of privacy. So even if you are getting your workload done, if you're idle, you're in trouble. Better ask for extra work. Ps they didn't tell anyone when they did this.

This company is all about the bottom line, and the worker are secondary to stock prices.  This company is definitely run by republicans (tea party types), when I was there they sent out several emails trying to get employees to call their representative to stop the health care reform bill in Washington.  That shows you how little they care about people, and they are supposed to be a health care company?  United has most of their call center operations in San Antonio.  They are there because they can find desperate people who need work and are willing to be paid much less than their staff in other locations doing the same work.

Her personal problems and attitudes were a cancer on the team. 14) No travel budget 15) No work life balance...management made one employee work on her wedding day. Another employee, a programmer, wasn't allowed time off for over 2 years. 12 hour work days and management resents you if you take a day off or work from home. 16) Don't expect a bonus because your boss kept it for himself. 17) Non-stop IT crises that could have easily been prevented. 18) A culture that celebrates snatching victory from the jaws of defeat rather than a boring win. 19) If you don't work in Eden Prairie you don't have a chance of promotion due to lack of visibility. 20) Technical managers severely lacking in basic people management skills. 21) Lip service to their \"culture and values\"."}, {"review_title": "Field based worker", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Oct 2017", "job_title": "Field Based Staff in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay, good insurance, and good experience.", "cons": "Micro managed by manger.

It is a meat grinder.  If you like to work long hours with a workload built for at minimum 2-3 people with little recognition or relief then this is the place for you.  They preach work life balance and opportunity, however in the 4 years I worked there i saw very little balance.  In 4 years I received great reviews but received minimal raises (below standard of living raises) and no bonus payout.  The corporate culture is such that you are expected to tow the company line and never question anything.  So if you are a robot that can follow directions without questioning anything, you will do great and love it!  Advancement opportunities and development are nonexistent.  If your manager does not want to lose you or does not feel you are worthy of an advancement opportunity, it won't happen.  Even if you apply for the posting - your manager can make that not happen with one word to the hiring manager.  Development opportunities are limited due to budget constraints even though they make billions in profits each year.   Bottom line if you like hard work with a large workload, long days without pay or recognition opportunities, managers who are condescending and full of empty promises,  this is the place for you.  If you enjoy being a cog in the machine, where your input is not solicited or wanted, you should apply for a job here.  If you enjoy watching your hard work line the pockets of upper management and the executives and shareholders, you should hurry up and get your application in right away.\r\n\r\nClearly I am disgruntled.  I chose to quit after 4 years of trying to see the good - hoping and waiting for management to do what they say they do.  I was hoping it was a poor manager or leader or an atypical situation causing my experience to be this way.  But I finally got tired of the same old thing, day after day.  They hook people with false promises and then chew them up and spit them out when they no longer drink the kool aid and just move on to the next cog.  Like a virus.

A place where people get prompted because they are friends with that manager and do not care about your background.

That is UnitedHealth Group.\r\n\r\nForget about getting prompted or moving up unless you're best friends with someone. Anyone from United can tell you this. You could have the perfect resume for the open position but don't hold your breath, you won't get it unless you know someone. They rather hire someone from outside than promote from within. I've seen some amazing talent walk out the door. They didn't do anything to keep them.\r\n\r\nIT was a nightmare. Systems were so old and always crashing. Nothing was stable and the call volume in the call center was so high people had a minimum wait time of 30-40 minutes. The training they had for us was a white PowerPoint with hundreds of words on it. Some systems you had to login four times to get to where you're going. The equipment and software was low quality and about 10 years behind and your typically database administrators do not even know SQL. Acquiring so many companies during the year leads to bringing in their old equipment and systems. Instead of merging to a centralized system such as SAP (something similar), they just bring in their applications. The application database is over 3,000 applications. \r\n\r\nThe benefits were very low grade. For working at a health care group you would think the benefits would be a little better. Nope, not here. I had better benefits working retail in high school. \r\n\r\nIf you work in the call center, be prepared to not get time off work. You essentially have to call in because there is never availability because they are understaffed.

A Fortune 25 company that doesn't offer it's employees sick time. You have to take an \"occurrence\" which leads to write-ups and possible termination.

Never mind payday wasn't until that Friday...never mind the fact that she didn't notify in her joyful email any details on participation. No food.NO eat.

I, and nearly everyone else below the level of director, am paid *at most* two-thirds of what I'm worth, this according to every \"average salary\" website I queried.

I have seen many individuals who are responsible for literally *millions* of dollars of business for Connextions completely ignored in the \"morale boosting\" emails sent out by executives. I've never seen upper management so completely out-of-touch with the people who are responsible for their continued success. This is to say nothing of (absolutely non-existent) monetary recognition. Non-callcenter employees do not get pay-for-performance. You can code the solution to a huge problem, fix a million reports, solve a massive technical headache, work overnights/overtime on salary, close hundreds of helpdesk tickets... for nothing. No recognition, no raises, no bonuses... nothing. Not even the faintest whiff of a thank you from the higher-ups.\r\n\r\n     Please bear in mind that I *do not* work on the floor as a callcenter agent. They have it even worse: FTO, or forced time off, not announced until they've driven 30 minutes to work in some cases. Nearly impossible-to-obtain pay-for-performance. Inept management. Favoritism. If you *are* unlucky enough to end up a callcenter agent, come to work in a dress shirt and tie, be professional, nail your metrics/KPI and then enjoy your new position as coach/supervisor in a few months.

This is probably the only glimmer of hope I have to offer someone who's thinking of applying to Connextions.\r\n\r\n     The CEO of Connextions, Jack LeFort, is your typical detached executive. His belief is that unless you take on additional responsibility or \"bring something new to the table\" that you do not deserve a raise. Apparently the man has never heard of inflation or a cost-of-living increase. The sad thing is, I and many other people have taken on *huge* new responsibilities month after month, year after year, with no increase in compensation. I know of half a dozen people who've gotten promoted to a new position without an accompanying raise, even when its been promised to them. Also, even though Connextions now serves the top 7 largest insurance carriers in the country, the \"benefits\" are still a joke. $4,000 deductible on a plan with a $200/month premium? Really? How do you expect your workforce to be able to pay that on the pittance you send them home with? You should be absolutely ashamed of yourself, Jack. I certainly hope you don't consider yourself a Christian.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I and every co-worker I've spoken to (dozens, if not hundreds) feel the same.

This is by far one of the worst paying jobs I've ever had since I graduated high school and then college.  I delivered pizza back in high school and I believe this job is far worse than that.  I made more on tips sometimes than I received for my commissions.  They lure you in with a salary + commission and tell you that you should expect to make closer to the $25 per hour with your commission.  Not even close in fact it's probably closer to the $14 before tax including your commissions.  Connextions  is compensated somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 - $700 per sale that you make for the company and out of that you may at best make $7.00 which equates around 1-2%.\r\nBenefits - It makes me cringe even to refer to them as benefits because that means there is some sort bonus or additional perk to the job.  They have a very high deductible and a very high premium.  I would not be surprised if they made money back on that.  Most corporations pay around 2/3rd's of your total premium and I would be surprised if they paid a dime.  You'd think that a company that sells on behalf of some of the largest insurance companies in the world could have negotiated a decent policy on behalf of their employees.  It's horrible and it would probably make better sense to find your own policy outside of the company.\r\nWork environment - They have very nice offices and in fact tell you not to bring food or drink on the floor as you might make it messy(literally treating you like a kindergartner).  They do this because they want to present themselves as a first class organization which they are not.  You know the old saying don't judge a book by it's cover.  Everything is about the client at the detriment of you as one of their employees.  HR will lie to you and hold information back about your job security until you are far down the road and after you finally become a licensed agent.  They will then spring on you that this is a \"seasonal\" type of employment and after open enrollment is done they will begin cutting jobs.  They told me I was safe because I was working for a particular insurance company that typically keeps a lot of extras around...not the case.  They pretend to look at your request for shift and hours you can work but it will look nothing like you had requested to work.  If you have a break scheduled for a certain time and you don't take it exactly then because you might be on a call they will penalize your rating for not taking it exactly at the time your were scheduled which affects your bonus/commission and then tell you they can't do anything because they can't change the set up.  You literally get penalized even if you don't take the break...it makes no sense.  You might be better off hanging up on your sale to make sure you aren't penalized for taking your break at exactly the time the computer has set for you.  This was the most asinine thing I've ever heard of.  Thank God I found a job before I was told my ranking wasn't up to snuff...maybe I was trying to make a sale instead of taking my break when it was time.

I'M NOT A DAMN ROBOT! \r\n\r\nthey recently just released their compassion model which......is a JOKE. how do you expect health advisors to have compassion 24/7 when there really is no compassion shown to health advisors? \"thank you for calling mbr services, to whom do i have the pleasure of speaking with?\" is your opening and \"was there anything else that i could help you with? were you satisfied with your services you received today?\" is your closing. keep in mind , THATS MANDATORY and a QUALITY SCORE! So if you don't say your opening or closing your quality goes down. How do you measure compassion? HOW!? This is the most outrageous, ridiculous thing I have ever heard or been exposed to.  we are the frontline, yet we are treated like robots and numbers. where is the compassion UHC?! TERRIBLE TERRIBLE place to work for.

NOW. \r\nI lived everyday with excessive stress and anxiety when i worked here. That only peaked when there was mandatory overtime, which can last up to 6 months. basically what that means is that you will be rotting away at your cube talking to dissatisfied UHC members because nothing is streamlined in UHC! no communication between other departments (claims, notfications, etc) not to mention the notes left in auto doc or claims are impossible to read and understand unless you are the actual person who left the notes. \r\n the micromanagement, mandatory overtime, no real direction, just about everything about this job was terrible\r\n\r\n\r\nI felt like i gained my life back when i left.

The building is very new and always kept very clean.\r\n\r\nThey have a nice cafeteria with lots of healthy food (except for the hash browns, which made me sick).", "cons": "They are basically a very dishonest company.\r\n\r\nWhat they tell you:  If you don\u2019t have any experience or training in Medical Coding, that\u2019s okay, they\u2019ll take you wherever you are and give you the training that you need to succeed, and, if you don\u2019t understand something and make a mistake, they\u2019ll go over it with you again and tell you where you went wrong and help you get it right, unless you make the same mistake too many times.\r\n\r\nThe truth:  Training is extremely fast-paced, and if you don\u2019t have previous experience or training, you\u2019ll probably get lost very quickly.  They don\u2019t have time to go over anything a second time.  And any mistake will count against you.  The training is basically a review for people who already know all about medical coding and just need to know about how United Health Group\u2019s software system works a little bit differently from the software that other insurance companies use.\r\n\r\nWhat they tell you:  If you don\u2019t understand something, they want you to ask about it, because they want to make sure that everyone learns everything and no one is left behind.\r\n\r\nThe truth:  If you do ask any questions, the trainer may answer them, but she will keep a record of this and will complain to management about it, without ever saying anything to you about it.  And the manager will tell you that you\u2019re holding the whole class back and that a lot of your classmates are complaining to her about you (whether they are or not).  She\u2019ll make you feel so guilty about that that you\u2019ll almost feel as though you should quit, for the sake of the rest of the class.\r\n\r\nWhat they tell you:  The assessment test that they give is \"just an assessment to see where you're at.\"  If you don\u2019t pass it, don\u2019t worry, this just tells them where you are so they'll know what you already know and what you still need to be taught.  The trainer will also say that in the past, people were let go if they failed more than one assessment, but she thinks that that\u2019s a bit extreme and she will be more lenient and will give you more chances and go over things with you again if you get them wrong the first time.\r\n\r\nThe truth:  You WILL be let go if you fail more than one assessment.  And they won\u2019t go over the specific things that you did wrong.  If you ask to have someone tutor you outside of class time, they will tell you that they can\u2019t do that because they would have to pay you overtime and they can\u2019t afford to do that.  They may have someone go over something with you outside of class time, but you will have to give up your break or your lunch time to do that.\r\n\r\nIf you do have someone train you one-on-one during your break, you need to be very careful about the way you respond.  If you\u2019re excited about finally being able to understand something, you\u2019d better not let your excitement show, or the person training you (if it\u2019s the same one they had train me) will tell management that you became agitated, and you will receive a final warning for this.  And they will lie and say that you still didn\u2019t understand, even if you did understand.  Even if you send them an email thanking them and telling them that you finally understand the material, management will ignore this and will always believe them over you.  People, especially trainers, love to twist things that new employees say in order to make them look bad.  So you have to be very, very careful.\r\n\r\nIf you email your trainer with a question, so as to avoid interrupting class and allow her to answer your question at a time that\u2019s convenient for her, she will more than likely misunderstand your question and answer a different question that you didn\u2019t ask, while not answering your question.  If you try talking with her about this, she will tell management that she did answer your question, but you claimed that she didn\u2019t.  She will never, ever admit that she made any type of error, including misunderstanding your questions.  She\u2019ll always turn everything around on you.\r\n\r\nThe trainer will never let you know if she\u2019s unhappy with you, for any reason.  She\u2019ll always smile sweetly and be very jovial, even as she\u2019s secretly writing down every complaint that she has against you.  And she won\u2019t go to management right away with her complaints.  She will save up several complaints over time (most of them groundless or exaggerated), and will eventually go to management with all of those complaints at once, at a time when you least expect it.\r\n\r\nIf your training class is anything like mine was, your classmates may not be much better.  Some people, often those who seem the sweetest and most friendly, will often say very nasty things about someone who isn\u2019t in the room.  Then, when that person comes back, they will act like that person is their very best friend.  One must be extremely careful around people like that.  Of course, every company has at least one person like that, but United Health Group has much more than their share.  Backstabbing is a very deeply ingrained part of their company culture, and it\u2019s actually encouraged by upper management.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to my next point.  United Health Group claims to value relationships, but the way they manage people says otherwise.  They discourage any attempt to resolve conflicts or issues directly with the person you\u2019ve having the issue with by punishing the person who tries to talk things over directly with a coworker, or trainer.  Instead, they have people go to management, without ever saying anything to the person they have a problem with.  This creates constant fear and distrust of everyone, especially the trainer.  You just never know what someone might be saying to the manager behind your back.  The one who seems the most warm and friendly and says they\u2019ve got your back is probably the one holding the knife.  When the manager says that a lot of your coworkers are complaining to her about you (but won\u2019t say who), this makes for even more distrust.\r\n\r\nSome other problems:\r\n\r\nThe trainer has an annoying habit of constantly swirling her badge (which is attached to a clip with a string that automatically retracts) around and around her hand.  She does this even more quickly and vigorously while she\u2019s going over something especially complicated that requires you to focus all your attention on what she\u2019s saying.  It almost seems as though she\u2019s testing your ability to stay focused while doing her very best to distract you.  The other trainers/tutors do the same thing, also while they\u2019re explaining something especially complicated.\r\n\r\nThe trainer talks very quickly, in a very breezy, casual, almost ditzy-sounding tone, especially when she\u2019s explaining something especially complex.  This is a time when you need to be especially focused on what she\u2019s saying, but her tone says otherwise and makes this even more challenging.\r\n\r\nThe trainer will sometimes make fun of people who are unfamiliar with the software (such as the chat room or the company\u2019s internal website) in front of the whole class.  And she never apologizes, for anything.  It\u2019s almost like being back in grade school.\r\n\r\nDuring the last half hour, or 45 minutes, of class, the trainer will play Pictionary with the class using the computers.  Though I like Pictionary, I always silently lamented the fact that I still had unanswered questions and I wasn\u2019t allowed to use this time to get them answered.  Of course, I never expressed this because I knew that that would get me into trouble, but it always bothered me.\r\n\r\nThe IT department is very inconsistent when it comes to installing the software and features needed to complete the training and learn the job.  Some computers have some of the software but not other software, while other computers have the software that the other ones don\u2019t, but don\u2019t have the software that the other ones have.  There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to it.  I had to move around quite a bit, from one computer to another, in order to access the software that I needed to try to complete training.  They will tell you to contact the Help Desk (the IT department) and ask them to install the necessary software, but you have to be very careful about the way you word your request, or they will say that you haven\u2019t provided them with the \u201cbusiness justification\u201d that they need to know that it\u2019s absolutely necessary.  And sometimes it doesn\u2019t matter what you say.  They\u2019ll just keep on saying that you have to provide them with \u201cbusiness justification,\u201d no matter how clear you\u2019ve made it that it\u2019s necessary.  The only person they\u2019ll really listen to is the trainer.  They\u2019re experts at NOT doing their job.\r\n\r\nThe lack of common courtesy is appalling.  People will walk right into you (in the halls and in the cafeteria) if YOU don\u2019t get out of THEIR way.  They seem to do this more to new people than to those who have worked there longer.  It\u2019s as though they don\u2019t think that you have the same right to occupy space that they have if you\u2019re new.\r\n\r\nThe building is very difficult to find.  Yes, it is a nice new building, but the last time I checked, it wasn\u2019t on GPS or Google Maps yet, probably because it was so new.  It required a lot of wandering around and trial and error to find the place.\r\n\r\nIf you are let go, you aren\u2019t allowed to say goodbye to anyone or retrieve your personal belongings.  They will have one person watch you and make sure you don\u2019t move while someone else goes and gets your things for you.  They will then have you give them back the key that they gave you to the safe that holds your company laptop.  This is fair enough, however, when this happened to me, they kept insisting that they had given me more than one key (which they hadn\u2019t) and demanded that I show them all the keys that I had with me.  When I took all my keys out of my purse, they tried to get me to give them one of my own keys and demanded to know what all of my keys were for.  This was a violation of my personal boundaries, and an attempt to rob me.  I had to argue with them for a long time before they would finally accept that they had given me just one key.\r\n\r\nIf you want to work for a company that respects your personal boundaries, with a supervisor or trainer who has enough respect for you to be honest with you if there\u2019s a problem and will try to resolve it with you before going to upper management, please stay away from this company."}, {"review_title": "Not recommeded", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative Pharmacy Benefits Manager in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Gain great Knowledge about Pharmacy Benefit Management as you go along on the job.", "cons": "Limited time for Management Supervisor contact between their teams.

My disappointing odyssey began with a phone call telling me I was hired. I was given a time, date, and location for training. The trainer emphasized to not be late as the trainer would NOT tolerate tardiness. I was among the first few to arrive and did so about 20 minutes early. Keep in mind this was late October in a cold, driving rain on a windy day. Thankfully there was shelter over the sidewalk as one-by-one we arrived and huddled together. We were told the training classes were for 12 people maximum but around 40 or so people showed up. The appointed hour arrived and... no trainer. Two hours later someone let us in and no one knew why we were there. There were no trainers on site. They were called and finally arrived about 3 hours late. After mass confusion we were escorted to our training classes. Later that day I was told I was in the wrong building. So I gathered my things and went to my car. My trainer caught me at the last moment and told me that there had been a mistake and I WAS supposed to be in her class. Let me say a word or so about my trainer. She was amazing. The training curriculum was a joke but she did the best anyone could reasonably expect. Outdated training materials put together in Publisher comprised the majority of it and that was for those who could access it. Many of us couldn't for weeks. In fact, many of those in my class had no access to ANY of the tools until the 5th and 6th weeks! They were still held accountable for learning the information (which did I mention was hands-on for the most part?). Most fell hopelessly behind and had no idea what was going on. The trainer apologized often but unfortunately had to tow the company line and tell us to learn what we could. \r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks we had two training assistants join us to act as Subject Matter Experts (or SME's as they're called). I've worked with similar companies in the past and there is always someone you can go to for help. That is the function of the SME. They're there to help you when you hit the wall. That is if you're fortunate enough to carry a copy of the company's Rosetta Stone in your back pocket to make sure you ask for help the right way. I understand the company wanting us to learn to do things ourselves. But when you're new and have zero experience with the company or industry, some help is needed. After you get to the floor you'll have a regular SME and they act as if their job is to figure out a way to NOT answer your questions. It's like Jeopardy on steroids trying to squeeze information from them. And it's not entirely their fault. It's the way the company is structured and the policies they follow. It's as if the company literally handcuffs them so they can't help. And what are the SME's doing that they can't be bothered? They're managing the queues. Everywhere I've worked they have a dedicated team that performs this task but UHC places it upon the shoulder of those who are there to help processors and adjusters. So essentially, you're on your own. \r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be so bad if their SOP's (Standard Operating Procedures) weren't so maddening. They have this delusion that EVERY situation can be covered by an SOP. Reading through one of these has to be the most confusing mess ever devised by man. They're written like a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" book, where you are presented with \"If\" and \"Then\" statements. It sounds simple enough but assumes you know all the information within already. And when you think you do, they issue a 411 alert and change them. This happens almost daily, which means the steps you did yesterday is no longer correct. Rather than hire true technical writers or people with such a background, the company opts instead to promote those who have performed well on the floor into these roles. Needless to say this isn't the best way to maintain a catalog of company policy and procedure. Some people simply cannot write clearly or express the meaning of what it is they wish to describe. \r\n\r\nAnd what of the work itself? The systems are antiquated garbage. I hate to use such a strong word but there's no better way to say it. Multi-billion dollar corporations aren't meant to be ran primarily on Microsoft Office. Remember when I spoke about other companies having dedicated teams to manage their queues? They also have means to track your productivity. UHC, on the other hand, does not. You're expected to enter your work on a daily tracker done in Excel. And the claims system itself? A refugee from the late 90's that should have been retired sometime during the second Bush administration. The computer systems go down on a daily basis. To call them fickle is like saying of the Pope, \"He's a really decent guy\". It's such an understatement that it's mind-boggling. It's nothing to lose an hour each day or more to at least one of the systems being down. Sometimes it's global and other times it's just you but you can bet your productivity will suffer for at least one stretch of the day every single day. If not, you'd better buy a lottery ticket on that day. \r\n\r\nSo why should you care if their systems are down? Well if you telecommute and the systems are down for more than 4 hours during your shift, you have to make that time up! That's right! They can't maintain their lousy, antiquated systems but ultimately it rolls downhill. You can choose to have that time deducted from your paid time-off if you wish or else you make it up. I'm sorry but maintaining their systems is UHC's job. My guess is that it runs on antiquated servers but I have no proof of that. \r\n\r\nUHC claims accuracy is the most important thing when working a claim. This is a lie. They are far more concerned about speed and clearing out the queues. Just about every single adjuster or processor I know has to cheat to make their numbers. Some simply uphold every claim that comes across their screen. Some work off the clock to pad their numbers for the tracker and manipulate the numbers into it. There are many ways people make their numbers but most of them are not legitimate. Does anyone really believe you can open a claim, make sure all the information matches, assess the situation, make a determination, notate and/or adjust the claim,  possibly send a letter, and enter it into Excel within 2-3 minutes all day long? Some people are closing claims every 20-30 seconds. Management is keenly aware this is happening and they discourage it (wink wink nudge nudge). You're encouraged to keep going faster and faster. Want proof that speed trumps accuracy at UHC? The more claims you complete the less likely you are to have them reviewed! Once you reach a certain level they will pull only 4 claims per month to check your work. It should be the opposite if they're concerned with accuracy. If I see someone completing a claim every 20-30 seconds, I have to wonder if they're doing it correctly. I honestly feel sorry for our providers. The same claim can cross our desks 6-8 times before someone will take the time to do the right thing. Sadly, those people won't be around very long. Taking time to do it right is frowned upon. \r\n\r\nAnd what of management? Everywhere I've worked in the past there is a team manager available to help. Our team managers know nothing about our systems. Very few of them can even process or adjust a claim. They're great at sending out inspiring quotes but when it comes to knowledge of their subordinates' jobs they're ignorant. They are there to compile reports and play cheerleader. \r\n\r\nI'm most concerned with working off the clock. The Department of Labor needs to thoroughly investigate this company. Once when I received a new computer, I was told I needed to set it up on my own time. This wouldn't be a big deal maybe if it was a 10 minute job and done. But nothing is ever simple with UHC. Such an endeavor will no doubt take hours of being on the phone with the help desk for ... something. I don't work for free. At the end of the day everyone is given 5 minutes to input information into their trackers. If it takes longer than that, then you're doing it on your time. There are literally thousands of time violations each day. If they were forced to back up and pay everyone what is owed to them for those 5-10 minutes each day that aren't accounted for on the trackers, it would cost them millions. \r\n\r\nThe pay is middle of the road. It certainly isn't special nor is it commensurate with the work and aggravation. The benefits are horrible! The insurance is little more than a piece of paper. You will pay most everything out of pocket. \r\n\r\nI could go on and on but will stop here. My first day I called my spouse and said it was the largest Mickey Mouse operation I'd ever seen. I've been with the company nearly two years and haven't changed my mind yet. I stay because of the opportunity to telecommute. If they ever take that away or I can find a similar opportunity with a better company, I'm gone."}, {"review_title": "Its a call center so don't expect too much.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Nov 2016", "job_title": "Clinical Administrative Coordinator in Minnetonka, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay is okay, and you'll meet your monthly metrics/sales goals IF you work overtime.", "cons": "No growth at all.

Once the practice has signed, the consultant, who has been waiting in the wings, is then tapped to serve as the primary contact for the ACO practice with very limited knowledge of the negotiations or nuances of the contract that was negotiated without even a \"listen only\" presence. \nUHN or Network largely used RN's BSN, and MSN's (and paid them far more than attorneys)to negotiate contracts. This practice in my opinion was disorganized, unprofessional and disrespectful to the ACO's of which they were contracting. \n\nCompensation: Given the demographics (RN, BSN, MSN, 95% female workforce) the compensation for the rural location in which we worked was \"adequate\" considering the state of pay for nurses generally speaking.
