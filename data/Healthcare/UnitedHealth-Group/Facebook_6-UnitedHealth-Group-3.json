It ended up being a lose lose situation there. whenever i had questions i brought them to my supervisor and they would go unanswered for weeks at a time, if not a month or more, and if i had asked another supervisor i would get pulled aside and informed i am not able to ask other supervisors for assistance when i had already asked my direct supervisor. Or if you ask a question that consisted of a yes or no answer, management would give the vaguest answer possible leaving you more confused on what the answer would be then when you started."}, {"review_title": "Big company, if you can adapt, you will do alright.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 Jun 2011", "job_title": " in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Great PTO (no sick time, that means you can take more PTO for vacation.

The tuition reimbursement is generous and when I had an interview with a competitor, the benefits were verbatim the same. The people I know who came from other call centers, especially from collections, don't complain much about pay. 401(k) with some matching, 18 PTO days, all solid.\r\n\r\n* At least in the department I have spent most of my time in, the next few levels of supervisors have been strong. They do a lot of good and are, in my opinion, asked to do way too much. This may go off the cliff once you get above those few levels, but I was very lucky to be on a team where the 3-4 levels above me were filled with compassionate, professional, fun, and caring individuals. Likewise, most of the peers I work with are caring and dedicated to their work.\r\n\r\n* If you are a go-getter and strong at your job, there are definitely opportunities for advancement. In the two years I had been in my role, I would say a conservative estimate of 15 people in a department of 50-60 people were promoted to a variety of different positions. This isn't to say promotions are easy (see the cons) but this didn't represent a dead-end role to a lot of people. \r\n\r\n* They do care about training and professional development a lot. Depending on the role, there was 8-13 weeks of training to begin with, and then usually an hour of professional development weekly. Even if you end up disliking UHC, it's very easy to take what you learn there and move elsewhere with it. Many people do.\r\n\r\n* Work/Life balance after your shift is over is great. You're not taking work home with you, what happens at the office stays there. Mandatory OT in my department was very rare and limited. It isn't as true in other departments but the money is also really good for those overtime hours.", "cons": "* This is, at its core, a call center job. I felt like it was probably among the better call center jobs you could ever get (attainable metrics rooted in logic, largely pleasant customers, functional systems, etc.), but you are really subject to what any call center is subject to. That is more negative than positive. You will be sedentary for 8 hours per day and have limited personal time. They have a strict attendance policy and if you need to leave mid-day, there are ramifications for it. Your work can feel very unappreciated, and the errors you make will scream a lot louder than all the good you do.\r\n\r\n* I am very, very lucky to be single and childless. There is little understanding for those who have to take care of families, particularly in regards to the rather draconian attendance policy. Those who are in attendance trouble are nearly exclusively those who need to use days off to take care of sick children, and I've seen several exemplary peers leave because they needed a more flexible job. Likewise I mention a lot of promotions above, but I find most of those people to be childless. This is not discriminatory but rather a somber truth that the attendance policy does not work well for those with kids. \r\n\r\n* A lot of your fate is in your manager's hands. If you have a poor relationship with your direct supervisor, your career at UHC may be done before it starts. The stats are your baseline, but there will be a lot of people who make their stats. Those who get plum projects, promotions, and acclaim in the department are those who best work with their managers who will put their names out there. Usually, there's 2-4 people per \"team\" who get that kind of push, to the detriment of others. I was very lucky to have the skills to get in that position. Other very strong peers never get that shot. With the way feedback works, you often find out what you did wrong when it is too late to fix it for the opportunity you wanted.\r\n\r\n* Promotions. As I said above, there are opportunities. Just a few things to know up front. The general rule is that it is a year before you can \"post-out\" to other departments. That is true, but most people who get promoted don't see it until they're a couple years in. If you go in thinking that you'll put in your year with the headset and then find a higher up role...good luck. Additionally, competition is very strong and there is a lot of luck involved throughout the process. Your promotion may hinge on finding the role quick enough, getting the right interviewers, etc.\r\n\r\n* Feedback and Fixes are a long process and a problem. There is a once a year survey that doesn't seem to affect much change, feedback isn't well received and any process or protocol changes are laborious to get done. The second another department or a really high level manager needs to get involved, the hope of change dies out.\r\n\r\n* It can't be a UHC review without mentioning the health insurance. Yes, it's all high-deductible health plans. You can leverage those to your benefit, but the main perk of the plan is that it is very well subsidized. There is no higher premium/lower deductible option any more."}, {"review_title": "Run!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 May 2017", "job_title": "Benefits Specialist in San Antonio, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you get in early, you'll get an okay schedule \nGood teamwork and rewards given \nOkay facility \nPays the bills", "cons": "Micro managing \nWorst employee benefits ever \nTell you one thing but will mean another \nExpect an occurrence for everything \nCore value is compassion but upper management lacks this"}, {"review_title": "Recovery / Resolutions Analyst", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Plenty of work, overtime available, fairly flexible in scheduling, excellent benefits available, great facility, work from home opportunity, bonuses, holidays, lots of training, goals and milestones identified", "cons": "For a healthcare company the health benefits are not stellar, work is solitary though management tries to build a team atmosphere, sometimes overtime is mandatory, advancement is minimal, skills learned are not portable to jobs at other companies as all the software and systems are in-house"}, {"review_title": "RUN", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Feb 2019", "job_title": "Nurse Case Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High starting salary\r\nWork from home", "cons": "Isolating environment\r\nNo opportunity for advancement \r\nLittle/minuscule raises and bonus despite being \"high performer\"\r\nExpensive and poor health insurance (our members have better insurance).\r\nNo recognition for innovative ideas, just stolen by your peers or manager to make themselves look better than what they are.\r\nAll talk no action.

I believe that the greatest factor in your experience will be your manager. Some are terrific, and very supportive of your career (even if it means a loss to their own team). Some are, shall we say, not so great to work with.\r\n\r\nBut loyalty is rewarded, and you may find yourself following your manager as he or she takes on new responsibilities. If you're more focused on the success of the team than you are on making yourself look good, you'll likely be an outstanding employee and very happy with being there.\r\n\r\nThere are also a lot of truly brilliant people working for this company. As there are often projects that are broad in scope and not necessarily well-defined, there are many opportunities to shine, especially if you're willing to learn new skill sets.\r\n\r\nWork-life balance is encouraged; though again, your manager will be the one who most strongly influences your ability to be successful in this. In many positions, the company offers telecommuting options, which can be very positive as long as you have the personality for it (i.e., can work without supervision and won't be distracted by things at home). As the MN weather can be challenging in Winter, even the non-telecommuting jobs will generally allow employees to work from home when needed.\r\n\r\nThe paid time off policy is quite generous in comparison with other places where I have worked; depending on your position and length of time with the company, you can get up to 26 days off per year. This includes sick time; but as indicated above, if your job allows you to telecommute, sick time isn't nearly as much of an issue as it would be at most other companies.", "cons": "First: Salary. Have an interview with a manager? Does that manager discuss a salary with you? Do you agree on a reasonable amount? Well, guess what - it doesn't mean a thing. The HR department (known as \"Human Capital\") has a de facto stranglehold on the amount of your initial salary. Then, as you progress with the company, there are also rules limiting the amount of increases which you can receive at annual reviews (it's based on a percentage of salary). If you change from one position to another at the same grade level, the likelihood is that you will have no increase in pay, even if the new position has a much higher responsibility level. In other words, the people who make the final decision about your pay don't know you - they only know what's on paper. And neither you, nor your manager, nor their manager will ever be able to change anything about that. And it's a *great* shame, because I believe that the compensation overall is fair against the marketplace; but their complete inflexibility means that you will likely be dissatisfied with the experience no matter what you are paid.\r\n\r\nSecond: Insurance. I have *never* worked for a company with an insurance division (UHC) that offers such poor medical insurance choices to employees. As I speak to friends who work for other companies in the same geographic area, they are shocked to discover the terrible plan design of our health insurance. Not only that, but they only offer three plans; and all three plans are EXACTLY the same, with the exception of the deductible amount and the cost of insurance. I have the best plan available, and I have a $1700 annual deductible for in-network... and *everything* goes toward that deductible, including prescriptions. You can get an HSA, but make sure you have a boatload of cash if you need treatment early in the calendar year. Every year, UHG takes a survey of what is good and bad; and every year, employees complain about the insurance; and every year, corporate says that we should save the amount we aren't paying in insurance premiums so that we can pay our medical bills. They're missing the point; employees are looking for options. We're not idiots, we know that high insurance plans have lower premiums than traditional insurance. We just want to have at least SOME of the same choices that other employers offer.\r\n\r\nFor me, these two factors (which could be easily addressed) weigh so heavily against the positives that I do not recommend that people seek employment with the company. Why? Because these are over the direct control of the upper-upper management. All of your positive experiences will be at the local level; but where the corporation has the opportunity to prove itself as caring about its employees, it fails. That said, I work here, and I will continue to do so; but I do my very best to disregard our annual survey. Repeating the same requests over and over again with no results leads to nothing but frustration. If you're going to ask your employees what can be improved, you must maintain an open mind and allow for the possibilities that their concerns are valid. If not, don't bother sending out the surveys."}], [{"review_title": "5 year employee.

Absolutely designed by an idiot.  Too cumbersome and tedious to work with.  Everyone there hates, it causes 30 percent or more of the agent's frustration and aggravation.  The rest of the frustration is a poorly designed and overly redundant process.  You have to work feverishly to do 10,000 things for taking one order for prescription and to give the order status it's like playing hide n go seek for the final and correct status.  The poor customer has to stay on the phone for 30 - 60 min when there is a moderate problem to resolve.  One customer - a young person -said the Optumrx web site is a pain to just set up your username and password.  Every username he put in the system rejected it.  He got tired or trying.  This is over security - you can't even sign up.  They need to pay $16.00 per hour for the sheer aggravation of the job mechanics.  Customers call in upset and agents and pharmacist poorly notate the account - so it is a challenge to give a logical progression of what happened to the order.  You have to look high and low and around the block for answers and then if you can't find the info - they want you to read training modules and bulletins- all the while the customer is on the phone waiting for a status on their order.  If you still can't find it you can call someone to assist you.  It's like the agent have to ride a broken bike to do the job.  Ridiculous - but it's a job.  Even our trainer and trainer assistant said they were in part motivated to become trainers because they wanted to GET OFF THE  PHONES.  For a insurance company they need to invest money in not fixing the broken system but redesign it with professional and non experience testers to have a better system.
