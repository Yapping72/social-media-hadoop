Good people.\r\nNew department leadership that seem to have things moving in the right direction.\r\nPositive outlook on future opportunities and movement within Merck-Wilson.

You know what you will get for the most part.", "cons": "At this time, there is not a lot of opportunity for advancement within Merck-Wilson.  It's looking better but not there.  Often management will hire from outside when there are capable and qualified internal candidates.\r\n\r\nMedical benefits have taken a huge decline over the last 2 years.  The employee cost continues to rise as well as deductibles while the benefits and coverage are much less.\r\n\r\nPrescription drug coverage also have declined over the past several years.  Same as above.\r\n\r\nYear end raises are typically around 2% at best for employee that meet expectations.  Some will get up to 4.5% if they are top performers but that is a very few number of people.\r\n\r\nThe year end bonus is consistent as stated above, but even if you have a very good year the individual contributor effect on the bonus is small.  Meaning that you will receive the close to your median bonus no matter how you perform.  Unless you are a top performer.  That seems to make a substantial difference.  Note that top performers are very few.\r\n\r\nThe end of year review is on a bell curve.  Meaning that if there are 2 top performers in your level, then there have to be 2 bottom performers (even if the 2 put in the bottom did a good job).  This makes no sense to me and demoralizes the workforce to a point.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Merck wanted to be head and shoulders above the other companies in the area as far as pay and benefits.  Now they seem happy with status quo and have reduced benefits and target salaries to be in the 50th percentile.   \r\n\r\nThere is a tremendous workload for the number of employees in the Quality department.  It is often very difficult to get it all done in a day or work week.  This could be looked at as job security or not..  Note that this has gotten better over the last year.\r\n\r\nAddition to above note.  Note that many of the employees are salaried and work unpaid overtime to get the work complete.

Example, the performance evaluation program (determines next year's pay increases and bonuses) would be comparable to gladiators in a ring. Whoever is left standing is the victor.  Those who are perceived to have the most value are rewarded according to a differentiation scale which managers/directors have to battle it out in a differentiation meeting. Example 25% of employees will be received high rating, 50% receive average, and 25% receive low rating.  Employees could be rated in the lowest 5-10% performance category even though they met all their performance goals and objectives because there is a limited number of positions available to fit in the higher categories.  \r\n\r\nThe company conducts annual employee surveys where the employees give their opinion and feed back on management, their perception of the company, how they feel about their work environment etc.  The final overall company rating is linked to employee compensation.  Basically, if employees give a 75% rating then they get 75% of the target bonus. If the rating is 25%, then they get 25% of their target bonus. The better rating you give, the more of the target bonus is given. The worse the rating, the less the target bonus is given. \r\n\r\nUnprofessional behavior by some managers and directors such as belittling and yelling at their subordinates in front of other colleagues is looked over. This is largely due that there is no longer a visible HR presence. In past years, HR was a building away. Now, you have to call a toll free number to reach a benefit service center to discuss HR matters.  The other pathway is to express your concerns about your management thru 360 feedback on your management.  It does not appear to lead to resolution but only more resentment/passive aggressive retaliation when the manager or director reads the feedback."}, {"review_title": "Do whatever it takes - even if it means destroying people", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Scientist in Kenilworth, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent benefits, reputable company, good location", "cons": "Cutthroat culture, severe micromanagement, outdated IT infrastructure"}, {"review_title": "Executive Professional Representative", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "5 Mar 2018", "job_title": "Executive Professional Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Competitive pay and benefits.

So it was a great opportunity to learn about the pharmaceutical industry. They have the latest technology and information. I never appreciated how Merck was up to date with their technology and competitive with their way of working until I started at another company and we had to use forms to fill out EM. When i left Merck, I stayed in contact with a several people and I realized how small of an industry this is. I met some of the greatest people out there who I became great friends with and sometimes I wish there are more people like that every where else. I truly miss them now that I'm at a different job. Those people could never be replaced.\r\nMerck gives all the learning tools for you there, it's up to you to learn them or be like 80% of the people there and just go with the flow.

You have to have a very thick skin (or grow a very thick skin) to survive. Now you will meet your friends for life there, and you will meet some of the most horrible human being alive there. This is your typical corporate America, where they hire in numbers and layoffs in numbers. in recent years there have been many layoffs, and there are always high turn over rates. When I was there, my department could not keep people long enough. We were always training new people, ALWAYS. We were under staffed and there were plenty of over time. Now due to cut backs, my old co-workers tell me that they are still understaffed but over worked on their shift, overtime has been cut, and so has supervisors.\r\nIt was hard to move around to new jobs and opportunities. Some of the smartest people that I knew never got promoted or change roles because of job freezes and blocking movements. I hated every day that I was there during my last 2 years. I hated my department management because they hired pretty much baby-sitters who knew nothing about the process, my associate director got his job because he was buddies (boys club) with the other guys running the show in Rota, I hated the union group there because I was always peered pressure to never complain to HR about how other union employees with more seniority was treating me. One incident, a more senior employee said during shift change that I it does not matter if I'm pregnant, I am getting paid so I should be lifting heavy cans just like her. It's not her fault that I'm pregnant and that I shouldn't be treated with special treatment. I reported it to HR as a harassment. The next day, several union along with the shop Stewart told me to re-track my claim or else the next time i need the union to back me, I will be on my own.\r\nSince I was low seniority at one point, I was drafted to work double shift. there were many times when I raised the issue that I it's not safe to let me know at least a shift ahead of mine that I have to work a double. The resolution was to under staff the shift. My friend, after being drafted to work double shifts every day from 3 month (like 7 days a week for 12 weeks) was so tired, she fell asleep in the break room and got discipline for that. I couldn't stay one day because there was no one to take care of my kids at home. When I came in the next day I was disciplined for leaving. \r\nThere is a well define line about how the union and company people were treated. Company employees got support for health and medical life. Union employees were told to go home without pay or take a vacation day if they can't work.
