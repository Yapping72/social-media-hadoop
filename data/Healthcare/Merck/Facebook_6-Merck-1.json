Along with the lackluster financial results, the corporate culture has taken a beating.  Unfortunately, it's become a routine expectation for a wave of layoffs to occur every 18-24 months which impairs employee loyalty.  Consequently, I'd estimate at least 50% of employees are looking around for other opportunities.  I'd only consider working at Merck if you're absolutely passionate about a particular job opportunity here or just want \"Merck\" on your resume.

BTW, if you work in the research labs, at least in the scientific area, don't expect to get approval for an MBA of any sort.\r\n\r\nIn terms of non-tangible benefits, an openness to a flexible work schedule (arrival/departure times plus work-at-home) and having the possibility of a job-share (two people share one job and each work 3 days/week) separate Merck from other companies I have looked at.  A lot of the flexibility is left to the discretion of individual management, but generally you'll find people open to ideas of how you can balance your life.  You'll see \"work-life balance\" in various HR materials.  What this means is that you can overwork yourself on YOUR OWN schedule.  But hey, if it's going to happen, better it be on your schedule than on someone else's.\r\n\r\nOther benefits:\r\nThe scientists here tend to be smart, and some are super smart.  Most people I work with are above average, so it really makes the poor candidates stand out.  One often wishes that someone would do something about the poor candidates.\r\n\r\nMerck tends not to skimp on equipment, technology, and infrastructure.  IS does not lock our computers down (well, not much), so having a little freedom to customize and, yes, install a tiny app or two is one of those little things that really pleases me, at least.\r\n\r\nQuality (e.g. GMP Quality) is a really high priority.  Yes, there were some serious issues in the varicella manufacturing area a few months ago, but we in Research really hold ourselves to high standards.  It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been proud to be part of.\r\n\r\nGeorge Merck said \u201cMedicine is for the patients, not for the profits.\u201d  Despite all the bad press about how we ruthlessly killed people with Vioxx, only interested in profit, until we were forced to pull it from the market, :-)  I really believe that the majority of people in the company internalized George Merck\u2019s words.  I think we\u2019ve slipped a little from that, but the company is a lot more ethical than people would think.  We do a lot of charity work too, and unfortunately don\u2019t publicize it.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of charity, Merck provides a 100% match to one\u2019s contributions to health and human services charitable organizations, up to $30,000 (I think) per organization per year.  At West Point, there's a blood drive 5 times per year and they strive to collect 1000 pints (!!!) each drive.  That\u2019s a pretty tremendous goal if you know anything about blood drive productivity at corporate sites.  Merck also pays nearly $30,000/year for incentive give-aways (for example, a stainless steel thermos or a beach blanket) to help motivate donors.  That's a big commitment when there's rarely food at meetings due to cost-cutting measures.", "cons": "I have only worked in the scientific area of Merck Research Labs (MRL), so my experiences cannot necessarily be extrapolated to marketing, manufacturing, human health, etc.  Merck is recognized internally (though some will deny that) and externally as having a \u201cpigeon-hole\u201d mentality.  (Recruiters will tell you that right off the bat.)  This means several things.  Jobs are highly specialized; no one wears many hats so you don\u2019t get diversified experience.  One tends to get locked into a \u201ctrack\u201d, and hiring managers are unlikely to welcome someone who doesn\u2019t have direct experience.  You\u2019re not an engineer?  Then we can\u2019t use you in the fermentation or purification group, no matter how smart and accomplished and well-reputed a scientist you are.  No sales experience?  Forget moving into marketing.  \r\n\r\nDegree-consciousness is pervasive.  Non-PhDs are looked down upon in the scientific area.  No matter how experienced, how qualified, how much you\u2019ve proven yourself, you will not be given the same amount of responsibility as a PhD, even he or she is fresh from school.  The regulatory department used to hire only MDs, and only recently began hiring PhDs.  This is not the case at other companies where you\u2019ll even find Regulatory VPs without doctoral degrees.  At Merck it seems like you just can\u2019t prove yourself enough.  OTOH, you can earn yourself a PhD for free (if you do your research in 2 years, that is).  See benefits above.  \r\n\r\nYou hear so much about career development, but no one is willing to give anyone a chance to expand beyond their own narrow little scope.  There is often talk about intra-departmental rotations, and practically everyone has that on their Employee Development Plan (EDP), but you\u2019re lucky if there are four opportunities a year, at least in my department of 200+.  So much for the idea of cross-training.   And as for the EDP, a lot of managers just give it lip service.\r\n\r\nAs a result, you have people who are in the same job for 10, 15 years.   Entry level is Grade 9, they make it to a Grade 7 in ~5 years, and then just stay there for the rest of their careers because Grade 6 nearly always requires a PhD.  Especially now, when there has to be a \u201cbusiness need\u201d for a promotion from 7 to 6.  They\u2019ve taken away all hope of advancement for the underlings, people are totally apathetic, and leaving is their only option of bettering their careers.  And the message we\u2019ve gotten from senior management is, in essence, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t bother complaining, just leave.  Attrition isn\u2019t a bad thing; it means we\u2019ll need to fire fewer people in the end.\u201d\r\n\r\n(IAccording to a co-worker, the concept of career development IS different in the Global Human Health division, though.  There is support and emphasis on it, and people change jobs every ~2 years.  If you aren\u2019t looking for a new job after 2 years, they\u2019re wondering what\u2019s wrong with you.  Kudos to Global Human Health!)\r\n\r\nIn my department, apathy is pervasive in the world of the underlings.  There has been so much change that it all washes over everyone and people say, \u201cJust leave me along and let me do my job.\u201d  And the recent tag has been, \u201cIf I can figure out what it is after this last re-org.\u201d  Merck has a formal plan for employee recognition--awards of varying amounts, from $20 to thousands--but it\u2019s up to managers to implement the awards.  Some do it better than others, but a little recognition goes a long way, because there\u2019s not much else to boost lagging morale.\r\n\r\nThere has been a division of scientific leadership and management leadership.  This has lead to some weird reporting relationships that are driven by org charts.  It doesn\u2019t always make sense.  The idea is that scientists should focus on the science and managers should focus on the managing, or something like that.  This change did improve the managing, because some scientists were terrible at it (or just didn\u2019t really do it at all).  But there really should be some flexibility in the system so that you can do what makes SENSE and not be forced into an artificial situation.  On paper it flattens the management structure, but whether it does that in actuality and gives us \u201clean flexibility\u201d is another matter.  The most important thing is that the managers continue to get management training and proper feedback and do a good job of actually managing their people.

Not sure why senior management thinks that the solution to every problem is  to create a new system with a complex approval process. And this bureaucratic culture is not just related to regulatory compliance (where bureaucracy is a given) . In at least one case there is a business approval process you need to follow before you are allowed to move on and then follow the compliance approval process (which includes another business approval). The bureaucracy permeates every aspect of live at Merck. \r\n\r\nA very conservative company. The first , second, and third instincts are to do it the way we've always done it. I don't think Merck is a place to go if you want to trail blaze. In most aspects of science and technology, Merck is 5-10 years behind. For example we just figured out monoclonal antibodies a few years ago (while everyone else was adopting them in the 90's).\r\n\r\nVery silo-ed company. Different organizations are evaluated against very different criteria. Different departments all have their own agendas. It makes forming truly collaborative and cross functional teams difficult.\r\n\r\nWork-life balance is not always great. I listed this as a pro too as it very's by department. I've had 4 distinct rolls at the company.  2 were predominantly low stress with roughly 40hr work weeks. The other 2 were much worse. Under 50hrs was a good week, 60+ was frequent. Pressure from management can become intense, and when projects are managed badly the first thing to get sacrificed is always the private lives and well being of those at the bottom of the org structure. The sacrifice is not always rewarded either.  \r\n\r\nThere is a bit of perverse incentive in the way the company handles it's best employees. When you are identified as an ambitions and talented employee you are usually sent off to work on projects that have fallen behind - the idea being you can ride over the hill on a white horse and save the project. The problem is that those projects usually fall behind because they have bad management and bad cultures (i.e. not because of problems one person can step in fix no matter how talented they are), or just because they're \"behind\" goals that were never realistic in the first place. Being sent off to those projects is not exactly a reward worth working hard for.\r\n\r\nTop down decision making, thus decision makers are out of touch with the the actual consequences of their decision (a problem that I'm sure most large companies have) \r\n\r\nHealth benefits are a little below average"}, {"review_title": "Mismatch between public face and private culture", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 Sept 2008", "job_title": "Executive in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Broad-based pharmaceutical company with opportunities in multiple professional and geographic areas.
