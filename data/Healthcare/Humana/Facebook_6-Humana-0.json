I truly believe I was given a the warning because I tried to bring attention to the massive flaws in our work flow, in our department, and in the management here at Humana. I spent over a year away from my family while sending ignored messages to all levels of management. I believe I provided great ideas and insight on how to make the expedite process better for not only our members but for our employees. I provided pages and pages of examples of things said and done to me and others on my team with no response. I watched people leave while leadership used the excuse they couldn\u2019t handle expedite, when in reality these were amazing associates who just couldn\u2019t stand being treated poorly anymore. I personally recivef a final warning for saying \u201cBS\u201d (not the actual words, just those letters). I can assure you I have heard so much worse in our TEAM chat, by our leadership, and by the members who expect and deserve the best service they count on and pay for. Our team chat was so toxic it was deleted and taken from us so we could not communicate with each other or support one another. Members on our team as well as myself were continually punished for questioning the lack of leadership and direction and in the end it is costing you an employee who not only worked hard, stayed late, produced great work and actually CARED about the member. While working case work of others I have discovered there are so many employees that are poorly trained and whose cases are literally a train wreck. Records are not being requested appropriately, AOR\u2019s are being requested with no return phone number to call back to inform them what is missing or the steps that need to be taken to get their loved ones the help they so desperately need. Autofowards are at an all time high yet leadership has time to threaten and intimidate the very people who voice their opinions (like me) who are genuinely trying to make this a better working environment so that we can provide quality services to our members. I hope the leadership reviews the many emails I have sent pertaining to the toxic work environment and how poorly the employees in this department are treated, no one should be expect to work 10 hr days 6-7 days a week. The lack of accountability that is enforced is is puzzling to me, there seems to be no structure and leadership is nonexistent after 5:30. I truly believe you will continue to lose solid employees when you are asking people to \u201ccheck in\u201d on Saturdays when they are scheduled off.

Upper management can deny it all they want, but that's what it is. Every position on my side of the telephonic business is having their feet held to the fire to meet incredibly high member \"connects\" every day, week and month. Not only that, there are elements withing those calls that are being measured as well like talk time for the day and referrals to other departments. So, if my talk time is way up and my number of contacts is down, I may have spent too much time on the phone with the members. Or if I reached a high number of members and my talk time was low my quality may come into question and my calls may be scrutinized. So, saying this you are probably thinking that I am working in customer service and need to stop whining, right?? NO! I work with members regarding their health needs, encouraging health goals, answering questions and providing resources if needed. Yeah. The goal for my day would certainly be attainable IF every person I called answered the phone.  I have a coworker that made 45 calls to get only 11 successful connects for the day. They all have to be documented too btw. This doesn't include any anomalies in charts that need to be addressed and passed up the chain either. \nI can go on but I won't.

I don't feel micromanaged or pressured to take every single assignment. The salary is middle of the road good, and the benefits are excellent compared to most places I have worked. About half the staff were working from home before the pandemic, so very employee centered. Many of the employees have been working here for years (if not decades), so apparently Humana keeps doing something right to retain them.\n\nMedical is standard HDHP or Copay with a noticeably lower monthly cost than most places (its their own insurance of course). HSA is offered for the HDHP, but not much matching there compared to other companies (lower premiums probably make up the difference). Dental and Vision are pretty standard across the board. They have an excellent 401k match of 125% up to 6% of your annual salary contributions. I've never seen a company go over 100%. Although you have to stay 2 years to get their match vested in your Charles Schwab account.\n\nEach year you get a bonus up to a certain percentage of your salary based on company performance. You are told this max percentage when you are offered the position. First year you are prorated, but then you get the full amount after that. My first bonus was nearly the top amount, so Humana is not short changing you there. Time off is pretty standard with PTO time (sick and vacation combined). You earn almost a day per pay period, but no increase until year 9. Flexibility though is offered by most supervisors for appointments, so you don't get nickel and dimed for every doctor, dentist, or pickup the kid from school time off. Generous bereavement leave of 5 days off per event.", "cons": "There are not many, but a few nitpicks here and there. Salary increases are annual and determined based on work through December (although November this past year). Problem is that if you worked there less than 6 months during the evaluation period, then no annual increase for you. They used to give raises that following March, but now it is July. I was just short my first year of hitting 6 months (as of this past November cutoff) and so I really won't get one until technically 2 years after starting here.\n\nAnother issue I had was that their computer software is really locked down. Like software you have approved and installed on your computer will not take updates unless you get the admin password. This is fine for some products, but others have constant updates and are locked out from updating (and bug you constantly to update). You have to get IT to update the program for you if it is approved. And many times the software upgrade doesn't work (because it is locked down), so you then have to spend extra time get things fixed.\n\nThis year they have this \"Save a $1 Billion Dollars\" campaign company wide. Sounds scarier than it was at the time (as that seems like layoff speak). This is because they had less enrollments than expected. Not that they lost enrollments mind you. So, just remember that this is a FOR profit health insurance company."}], [{"review_title": "Solid Company with Dynamic Nature", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There is always something happening.

Instead, people are plugged into roles who obviously satisfied a technical or emotional need of upper management without regard for who best to lead staff in their needs of growth and development, i.e. a seemingly high IQ is chosen without a matching EQ.

Possible career growth (but barely), maybe the health benefits? Also, its work from home.", "cons": "Everything. First and foremost, I was an Inbound Contacts Representative 1 for Humana's HCPR Department for a year and 7 months. When I initially started out, I was told I'd see career growth amongst other amazing and inclusive things, which is why I accepted the job. This was always promised, but it was never given. It was a call center job, but I thought I\u2019d move up pretty quickly considering I have a college degree and good experience. I wanted a foot in the door. The year and 7 months I was there was the most miserable I've ever been at any job I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019ve worked retail for longer. The members will scream at you and curse you out, and your supervisor basically will tell you that you have to suck it up and take it. I was mentally, emotionally, and verbally abused every single day of my life. I left many shifts crying. Yeah, I could've quit earlier, but I had a job secured and that\u2019s what mattered most to me. I had coworkers who were also in the same position as I was, where they were miserable and had no type of life but needed a job and benefits. \nFor the department of HCPR, there is a peak period, which will be the worst period of your life. It runs from January to March, and you're not allowed to take days off (PTO) at this time, AND it is MANDATORY to work overtime every single week. I worked at least 10 hours a day, 5-6 days from January to March, and did not have a life outside of work. During peak (and even outside of peak months) calls will be back-to-back. You won't have a single break in between calls, and if a member is angry, you're 100% going to get screamed at by them. During peak, be sure not to make plans, don't make life events, don't get sick. You will have last minute mandatory overtime and be forced to work regardless of what\u2019s going on in your personal life. My team lead would \u201cjokingly\u201d tell my teammates, \u201cStop getting sick\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t approve of you getting sick\u201d. She wasn\u2019t joking. She was being very serious, but hiding it as if it were a joke, because she\u2019d genuinely get upset if people were sick. I had 2 emergency doctor's visits during peak, and I got occurrences for these emergencies. An occurrence is basically an absence, and if you have 3 or more it can result in termination. Now, please tell me why a healthcare company will not excuse you if you have emergency doctors\u2019 visits? They penalize you, even if you have a doctor's note. The doctor\u2019s note means nothing. You're basically treated like a slave. Once you accept that job offer, you are theirs and there isn't anything you can do unless you quit. Even outside of peak months, it is difficult to get a day off. If one person in the department is off on a day, then no one else can have off unless you beg your supervisor. \nAdditionally, you will be micromanaged. The micromanaging is real. Never have I ever been so closely watched at work. I was the best on my team (as told by my supervisor) but was still super micromanaged. If you come back from your lunch even 1 minute late, you get questioned and they will remove that time from your pay. You could be bleeding from your eyes and they will still tell you that you have to log into work. I've had teammates who have been sick/had emergencies and were forced to work. \nEmergencies happen, sicknesses happen. Life happens. It's unavoidable. The way employees get in trouble for these life emergencies/happenings is absolutely atrocious. No human should ever have to worry about getting in trouble from their job for having an emergency/life event of any kind. People have things to do after their time at work, and it's not like we can schedule emergencies. Humana, as a healthcare company who highly promotes \"well-being\" should have a better method to allowing their employees to go to the doctor or if an emergency occurs.
