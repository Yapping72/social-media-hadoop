When I got this client who had given up trying to appeal the denial, after several talks I convinced the client to go to another doctor appointment to be re-evaluated then try to appeal whole process and I would help on my end. Client did this, I tried coordinating on my end with appeals department and reaching out to the medical equipment company too. It took lots of time+coordination with multiple people. I definitely noticed that many times it was as if the \"right hand didnt know what left hand was doing\" so it was an overall frustrating time for me as the employee and surely for the clients when things did not go how they should. This is probably not the case for every department especially since not every client has this experience or needs this much help but when someone really needs the help it is sad to see that things do not go as it appears it should go.

It was cheaper to go on my husband's insurance.  There's no excuse for that...if you work at Humana, you should have a platinum insurance plan, not be treated like lesser citizens.  Also, the hiring process is deceitful.  They will tell you that you can advance in a year....but then at the end of that year, magically their will be a hiring freeze.  That freeze will last for a couple more years, too.  Meanwhile you will notice new hires arriving downstairs.  The only people lucky enough to slip through the \"hiring freeze\" are the ones who are in the cliques with upper management.  They play favorites, and don't promote based on job performance.

If you did go to high-school in Kentucky, take the job.\r\n\r\nIf you didn't, I suggest you keep reading.\r\n\r\nIt isn't to say that Humana isn't a nice place to be, it just means that you will have to be there a LONG time to effect any type of change or career progression. The data bares this out: despite having 15-20 Masters students coming in at one or two levels below Director, only one Infusion Associate has ever been promoted up to that level. The program has been running since 2004. \r\n\r\nThat wouldn't be all bad except for the fact that Humana has a performance incentive plan that make little sense and bears no resemblance to how such matters are handled at other large firms. (It is literally too complicated to explain here. Sufficient to say that a complete performance review cycle takes 18 months.) The result is an informal \"No-Raise\" policy for Infusion Associates. Don't worry though, you get a 4th week of paid-vacation after 7 years of service.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Humana has a history of brutal workforce reductions. I came in one morning to hear that they fired 20% of the marketing department. If you didn't baby-sit for your VP when you were in high-school, you have no political cover and Infusion Associates make easy targets. 10% of my Infusion class was fired within 5 months of starting.\r\n\r\nBut the introductory compensation is pretty great: on average $5K-$15K more than MBA would receive going into a health-care consulting role. The discussion will likely not start out that way as \"Humana doesn't negotiate offers\" but...well...if you believe that, you deserve $95K/year.\r\n\r\nAnd all that money comes with very little expected in return. The key insight is that Humana is not a Fortune 100 company; it's a small Kentucky health-plan that got extraordinarily lucky by stumbling onto a federal program early. As a result, they don't have a true need for young talent who are prepared to lead small initiatives because the place is still run like a rotary club; You're either an SVP or a project manager. \r\n\r\nBut at the end of the day, it's not very hard work. So you have plenty of opportunity to wander around and learn how a large health-insurance company works. You also get a nice title on your resume and a great salary off which you can benchmark future offers.  All this leaves you very well prepared to take a much higher paying job in a much more desirable city working with much more intelligent people after you've been in the job for a year and the pre-pay penalty associated with the signing bonus drops off.\r\n\r\nDon't worry, you won't be alone. \r\nApproximately 50% of my infusion class was gone within 13 months of starting at the company."}], [{"review_title": "They talk the talk but can't walk the walk.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Mar 2013", "job_title": "Company Contact Lead in Cincinnati, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I was able to help people with their insurance issues.

We have associates in certain areas who are on food stamps. Food stamps. How can this happen at a company with this much profit?\r\n\r\nHeavy politics get played. Humana's all about who you know and who knows you, rather than looking at employees for genuine skill, expertise and merit. Lots of cronyism and nepotism. Lots of at mid-levels who look good, sound good, and that's about it. All hat and no cowboy.\r\n\r\nThe company's very focused on developing \"top talent.\" That translates to about 1 percent of a workforce of over 50,000 employees. So if you're not at a director level or higher, or if you're not working very closely with someone who's in a powerful position, you're going nowhere fast. That can be very frustrating.\r\n\r\nWe're supposedly transitioning to an \"agile\" workplace model, but that doesn't seem to be happening for most folks. That's probably because too many managers are unsure on how to measure productivity by more than clicks on a computer and butts in a seat. Just because you can see the associate doesn't mean the associate's productive or able to make productive use of time with lots of office distractions. In addition, the low pay increases could easily be offset by allowing people the flexibilty of working from a coffee shop. It makes sense, but that idea seems pretty much dead in the water.\r\n\r\nYes, it's all about \"one dream, one team\"--until it comes to benefits and pay. Then that philosophy goes out the window. People are not stupid. They see the inconsistency. They just stay quiet because they don't want to lose their jobs.\r\n\r\nEngagement survey results are tracked down to the individual. They know who the most engaged associates are to the person. Nothing you put on that survey is anonymous. Humana, as I understand it, has an ownership stake in Kenexa. That explains so much. I will never answer another engagement survey, or if I do, I'll lie. I know how to manipulate results, too. \r\n\r\nHealth iInsurance for associates is sky high, and Humana's the insurer. You'd better stay healthy. If you have to use a high deductible plan, you'll be coming up with a huge out-of-pocket costs. When you have expenses that carry over from year to year, that gets expensive. Real quick.\r\n\r\nThey tell you in corporate communications that they want your ideas. Maybe. It all depends.

Fellow associates are often obnoxious due in part to being a byproduct of the toxic and stress inducing environment. Leadership with no knowledge of the supervised associates' work type is the norm.  The culture in the MSO department breeds distrust, the very person who smiles at you will be the one stabbing you in the back for a few APAT brownies. Speaking of APAT, you will never get a raise unless you are liked by someone in power, say your frontline leader.  The APAT is nothing more than a smokescreen used to justify who gets raises. It is a document with predetermined, vaguely defined \u201ccompetencies\u201d that are redefined each year to fit the associates who are favorites among leadership. This process is called \u201ccalibrations\u201d and it is a sickening display politics. You are judged by everything. The words you speak and write will be used against you. Do not make the mistake of thinking your words won\u2019t affect getting a raise, the sellout standing next to you is like a built in surveillance apparatus.\r\n\r\nHumana almost has a cult-like feel.

In my experience, you work much harder and there is much more of an expectation in an at home job such as this one, then in an office setting. There had been a significant growth in my department over the years but did not hired any additional staff to accommodate. They do monitor your productivity via DPA software, it shows any idle time and which activities you are spending your time. If you do your job, this is no big deal. But there is a slight micromanage. They really are proud of the Humana values and they do a decent job of reflecting most of them in my opinion. But there are some that I believe, and my team/department would agree, there is a disconnect on. An example- There is a 30 min wellness break each week that Humana promotes to its employees. However in the several years I was there- no one has been able to take advantage of it in my team/department. It had been \u201cin the works\u201d by immediate management for years. Large disconnect in upper management\u2019s understanding on what we do on the day to day. \u201cPioneering simplicity\u201d is supported and advocated by immediate supervisors but then gets combatted by upper management.  Which in my observations leads to some frequent frustrations with members and facilities. This is a very defeating feeing for my department/team to frequently be advocates for change, simplicity and best practices, only to be redirected by upper management who are not familiar with what you do on a day to day.

Planning ahead for vacations or out of town trips is a nightmare. They wont approve your time in advance. I've been told there is no way to send time sensitive requests higher up, no one to email. If you plan a vacation months ahead and notify them several months in advance they wont give you info until the first of the month you have your vacation, if not up to the week of. For a company with this many employees youd think there would be a policy in place to ensure that employees are rewarded for being diligent but that's not the case. Leadership acts as though there is an entity far beyond their reach that you should just hope and pray to that they approve your request so you dont get told the vacation is not approved and lose out on nonrefundable suites, airfair, tickets, etc. \r\n\r\nOther cons include their systems, it seems like there is a lot of unfinished ideas to improve call rep handle times and this has lead to different information being located in 8 systems and you're told constantly to stop using that, use this and then a week later stop that, do this.
