Salaries are competitive.  The company is large enough that you can find another position if you are unhappy with your leadership.", "cons": "The reason Humana has so many job openings is because they right-size every year between Sept. and Dec.  This avoids paying MIP bonuses and reduces the long term debt that needs to be reported to stockholders.  If you are not a director, but are over 40 and highly paid, it is likely to be you.  Several years ago, I helped coach an associate who was over 40 and was given a severance of 1 month salary and told they were doing a bad job.  With the letter was a printout of something called the \"Over 40 List\" that showed by role how many people who received such a \"package\"  were in different age groups.  Only one was under 40.  (This list is no longer in the packets.)  In the past, your management saw the paperwork about why you needed to be on medical leave or FMLA before it was sent to HR.  Poor health also makes you a target .  If you doubt this, look around at those who are right-sized and note how many are over 40 and how many more women are released than men - their health care costs are higher.  Humana used to let everyone go on Fridays and usually at the end of the month.  Having gotten smarter, now people are let go every day between Sept and Dec.  This makes it almost impossible to file a class action lawsuit since all must file within 180 days for age discrimination.\r\n\r\nAs other have stated, the health insurance is pitiful.  One year,  employee's renewals were changed to July so Humana could get feedback on he new benefit packages and software before delivering it to clients.  This also allowed Humana to charge higher rates to employees for 6 months.\r\n\r\nMuch of Humana's leadership is autocratic and extremely political.  Many of those receiving poor \"engagement scores\" were given an associate who's primary role is to keep associates happy and get those scores up.  Humana promotes many young talented people, but their salary increase for the promotion is minimal.  This creates a situation where many of their associates make considerably more money than the manager.  There is little management training before and after promotion and the lack of experience, arrogance and resentment makes associates over 40 a prime target when the just-in-time appraisals are done to target those who will be terminated.\r\n\r\nThe outsourcers who handle long and short term disability have one mission, get your disability disapproved or get you back to work as soon as possible.  They ignore your doctor's written statement that you are not ready to g back to work and harass those who are actually ill.\r\n\r\nHumana used to offer bonuses to managers but most of these have been eliminated.  Salary increases are also higher for directors and above.  This makes a huge variance between leadership and individual contributors or middle management."}, {"review_title": "Awesome company - cares about associates!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Mar 2013", "job_title": "Recruiter in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Really into Associate engagement, work life balance, wellness, etc.   Great company!", "cons": "Be prepared to speak \"business-ease\"  words like \"business acumen\" and \"collaboration\"  etc.    I am so ready for businesses to just speak normal!"}, {"review_title": "Glendale AZ is a disaster.

The health insurance offers next to no coverage unless you shell out several thousand dollars first. Premiums are way over inflated for the coverage you get. Any kind of customer service position will see virtually every member has better coverage than they do and may pay less for it.\r\n\r\nPolitics are horrible. If your supervisor does not like you, they will look for a reason to ride you out of there. I have seen this countless times with tenured employees.\r\n\r\nI was randomly pulled into a room with management and grilled regarding a personal matter that required time away from work. I was initially told the time away was fine, but then someone in upper management decided it was not. I was threatened over the course of two weeks regarding this while an inappropriate level of personal information was requested by management to \"investigate\" my issue. Ended up with a write up over something I was initially told was fine.\r\n\r\nYou'll routinely be asked to learn new skills, complete additional training, and have a heightened skillset once you're there for a while. The more I took on, the less flexibility I had. I could never adjust my schedule when the opportunity came up. PTO was now HARDER to use because only 1 person with my skillset could have the day off. It's a sucker's move to do more than the bare minimum job function. \r\n\r\nDon't ever get sick. I became very ill during my initial training period. My trainer contacted her manager and they agreed to let me leave early for the day. I did not request this. When I returned to work, I was told that because this was a day before a holiday that they would not be paying me for that time. I fought to no avail with the supervisor. When I told my trainer about this, luckily she was able to fight for me and I did get that time paid. Having to provide an EOB from my doctor was ridiculous. And, like I said, they sent me home -- and then tried to punish me for it!\r\n\r\nFamily member has a serious health condition. I applied for FMLA through their third party company Unum. After taking some time, I get a letter in the mail that they're revoking my leave because of a \"pattern\" of absences. They enclose paperwork to give to my doctor for my serious health condition....even though I'm obviously not the ill one. I have to fight (including a shouting match with an outsourced nightmare of a human being) because a specific date was not included for one phase of treatment and this treatment was weeks at a time. It was literally the equivalent of a t not being crossed, but they didn't hesitate to rake me over the coals for it.\r\n\r\nI'm not the only one that has had a problem with these vultures. A co-worker with a deteriorating heart condition was threatened over an absence where their supervisor had to call an ambulance. This co-worker also got FMLA time, but was routinely interrogated over absences as the condition got worse.\r\n\r\nAnother co-worker flat out gave up trying to get time approved for their child's condition. \r\n\r\nHR is a waste of time. I had the same supervisor for a year. When I was eligible to apply for other positions in different departments, I did not hesitate. Through the interview process, I found out my supervisor was speaking ill of me to one of the hiring managers that she was close friends with. After more than a year of being barked at and blatantly treated differently (as point out by several co-workers) I attempted to contact HR to report unprofessional treatment. \r\n\r\nThree days after filing my initial complaint, I received a call from a guy and he immediately dismissed me. He told me we had \"personality conflicts\" and they didn't get in the middle of those. I had several pages of notes and willing co-workers to speak on my behalf on the treatment I received compared to others. Didn't matter. They did offer to speak to my supervisor, but then point blank told me this would all but ruin any chance of me getting an offer in a different department. Retaliation, much?\r\n\r\nThreats. You're always doing something wrong. Dress code is always a big one. A co worker wore a themed shirt for breast cancer during our breast cancer awareness week. She was threatened with discipline because the shirt had a hood on it -- but was not a \"hoodie.\"\r\n\r\nManagement decided to resurface the parking lot. Employees were forced to park in the fields and gravel areas surrounding the building. We received a nasty email from the VP onsite telling us there is PLENTY of parking and anyone parking in a \"non paved\" area would be towed! Yes, they closed a large portion of the parking lot and then threatened to tow people that had no choice but to park in the mud."}], [{"review_title": "I love Humana!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Jul 2013", "job_title": "Analyst in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Humana is a wonderful employer.

Upper management continues to push productivity expectations to impossible heights. Leaders are completely out of touch with what most member-facing associates experience everyday, even though we voice our concerns - repeatedly. Management insists we must increase \"quantity\" while simultaneously improving \"quality\".\r\n\r\nManagement refuses to admit that higher productivity standards result in low-quality, corner-cutting interactions with members. It\u2019s all about your performance metrics - unfortunately the metrics are not built well enough to capture your work. Corporate arrogance reigns in thinking members benefit from being called multiple times a month (in my opinion the number of calls we make to members amounts to harassment).\r\n\r\nMiddle management is stuck drinking upper management\u2019s kool-aid and regurgitating it to member-facing associates. If you are an intelligent individual who speaks out when something is a-miss, you will never be hired or promoted to a manager position within the company. Independent thinkers need not apply. To become a manager you have to know the right people, and either keep your suggestions for company improvement to yourself or be completely ignorant to the corruption within.\r\n\r\nSince the acquisition by Aetna was announced (at 2am, on a holiday weekend, in an email to employees - this says it all!) things have gotten progressively more hostile. Nearly 40 employees in a specific position were informed in a company-wide email that if they did not have a master's degree, they would no longer be able to hold their current position. They've been told they can *try* to find a different position within the company (which pays significantly less) or accept severance. It's a crummy way to treat people, but this company does not see its associates as people, only money-making vessels.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this company preaches well-being is a joke. They stress their employees to the point of burnout, and then expect us to \"engage\" in the company. Guess what? We don't have time to engage because of the workload....and most of us aren't really buying that you give a hoot about our well-being. High deductible health plans, reducing 401k employer matching and other well-being rewards aren't sending that message.\r\n\r\nFrom reading other reviews, it seems like some departments of the company are better than others to work for. Humana At Home has not been a pleasant experience for me. I bought in to the company \"values\" and worked my butt off for the first year, wondering why most co-workers who had been there longer were so apathetic. Now I know.

They are completely out sourcing most jobs to India.  They tend to promote external people instead of promoting within.  They also demand insane overtime hours with very little time to leave your desk and are made to feel bad if you do.  I have seen first hand also very sexist promoting standards that are completely blatant.  Telling women with many years of experience that they are not qualified for the position but then promoting a man to the same position with less experience and the same degree.  The sales reps are expected to do nothing and demand internal people do all of their work for them and are allowed to treat internal workers with hostility.  Again, they pay workers terribly with very little if any raises.  They have terrible insurance which you have to constantly battle with to get anything covered.  We are talking for a family of 2 over $300 a month for $7000 MAX OUT OF POCKET. For someone who they pay $35,000 a year to.  It is a well known fact in the Green Bay community that Humana does not allow you to retire there.  They find ways to get rid of anyone over 50 after many years of service.  It is sick and their practices border on blatantly illegal.  they also fired a bunch of people for made up issues before outsourcing the jobs to India to avoid paying severance.

You rarely hear that you do a good job. The director is nice- but likes to nitpick on performance issues.Other regions and types of work for nurses are may be better- this was my experience. It was so bad there that one of the nurses went back to direct patient care- again fairly rare. Poor work-life balance. Forget about professional growth or opportunities to do something else- it's not here.

The 4 worst departments to work in, are production based, metric driven, and managed by a no fault occurrence system that several FLLs get yelled at for not following. In my experience, the worst depts are Item Entry, Data Entry, Pharmacy (both trad mail and specialty) and Customer Service (PCC and CSR). Humana is very large and corporate does not have a strong presence here. Most of the time the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing. \r\n\r\nIn the above listed departments they monitor every tiny thing you do. That means how often you use the restroom, how often you use the chat function to asks questions or collaborate with other depts to fix problems. They monitor the usual call stats, as well as call quality. The occurrence system is no fault, and I've seen people get multiple occurrences for deaths in the family, or even being so sick they feinted at work.\r\n\r\nOf course besides that, its the constantly unhappy customers. Humana has a way of  gutting their customers and they people they serve are very vocal about it. The company has a constant method of almost shameless brainwashing. They will encourage FLLs to put on food days, or ask people to join charity events, or show some extremely unknown award we received that no one knew existed and that no one cared about. They will have \"culture\" days. They will have \"theme\" days. You see, they use the same brainwashing that other successful office workplaces use to make you take a sense of undeserved pride in your job. All the while they sweat and stress you to the max. Offering zero work/life balance due to the nature of the occurrence system. The metrics are out dated and inaccurate. Call quality is extremely biased. Etc. Etc.\r\n\r\nThat aside, if you get blessed to KNOW THE RIGHT PEOPLE you can end up in a department on the lower level, where they are treated like human beings and can use the bathroom without supervision. They don't get micro-managed with horrendously soul killing metrics and they get to be the person Humana always said they could be. :D.\r\n\r\nSo you see? Te company as a whole has big problems, but you don't feel them when you are in the cushy departments that let you act like adults. Then, when you are in the departments I mentioned, and there are several other terrible ones trust me, some fall prey to the brainwashing, and ultimately sell their soul for that paycheck. Trust me ... unless u know ur a lucky person ... you do not want to work here."}, {"review_title": "Not what it's cracked up to be", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Specialist in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent pay but other than that I can't think of anything else positive to say right now.

It was as high as 20-23 hours a week on top of the regular 40 hour work week.They would \"ask\" for overtime even on very short notice and then ask you why you didn't sign up making you feel like it was mandatory when that isn't how they word it some of the time. For example they \"asked\" everyone towards the end of one week to come in for 4 hours or so on a sunday (which we do not normally work) I specifically asked in our meeting if this was a request or mandatory and was told it was highly suggested. I didn't take that as mandatory so I did not sign up since it is very difficult to find a sitter for my daughter since my husband works odd hours on the weekends and would be sleeping late.My manager was on vacation at the time so another boss basically grilled me as to why I wasn't signing up and if I could make up the hours the coming week.  I refused because they said it wasn't mandatory.  I did get into trouble because I didn't work the mandatory 10 hours of overtime that week either which I understand is punishable. Sometimes I just felt like I had to stand up for myself there because the management didn't have your back. They are financial compensated with bonuses for our good performance so of course you are only worth the quality/quantity of your work there. Anyone who tells you differently is naive and feeds into the wellbeing propaganda they spout to everyone so maybe they will overlook the pressure, stress, and constantly changing standards that you have to meet very quickly.Not to mention the AWEFUL health insurance that is more like a discount program. They were fine with the 30 rxs per hour I typed when I started but as it went higher and higher I kept struggling and that inital 30 went to 32, 34, 40 and I was still struggling to maintain 34 while keeping errors under control. I mentioned more than once that maybe I could move to a different department but it always fell on deaf ears.I was burnt out with the atmosphere (not the work) so it majorly affected my performance despite my best effots not to let it. It is difficult to get back on track when they make you watch other people that type twice as much as you and think it will do anything but make me feel inferior because I will never type that fast without making numerous errors. What is funny is I probably made more than the girl I had to watch type because they give raises sporadically and seemingly at random. They kept actng like quality over quantity was what matters most but as I mentioned before the expectation kept increasing.  I am not sure how they can say that our, my wellbeing, was important to them when we sat all day for as much as 14 plus hours a day during peak times. Yes the pto was nice but it was also for sick days which is understandable. They almost have to allot pto because the burnt out is so high there they try to offset it. But don't be fooled it isn't for our benefit, it is for the company's soley as they feel we will be more productive that way. I was unhappy there most of the time but felt stuck because of the money and since I do not have a degree yet. The communication between us and the management was not good. Different teams were told different things or nothing at all by email to recap meetings for people that weren't there. The new system they bought for us to use doesn't make sense in that it is not user friendly from a data entry perspective and whom ever decided to buy it has obviously never done our job.Anyway work for them at your own risk.

I suffered through that 3 weeks of training with promises that once we got on the floor, it would be better. It was anything but. It was a very strict, micromanaging call center, which I also wasn't made aware of when accepting the jobs. You literally would get in trouble for standing up, using the restroom, or even clocking in 1 minute early. This place was insane. The management for the most part, had absolutely no personality, they seemed very unwilling to help. They literally threw us to the wolves when they put us on the phones. Our training was very minimal and even after 7 weeks of employment, I was very unsure what I was doing 75% of the time. It was a very helpless feeling. As far as your schedule, they clearly play \"favorites\", I was stuck with the 9-6 schedule...Okay fine, I'll suck it up...but the thing is, you NEVER got off at 6:00pm, you could not leave that hell hole until every single call was answered. Do you have kids you have to pick up for prior engagements you committed to? TOO BAD! I honestly felt like I was in prison there. I had enough and quit. Now, here I am unemployed.
