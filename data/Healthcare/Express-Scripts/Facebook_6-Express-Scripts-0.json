I also personally had a bad manager, who kept pushing for technologies that I believed should have been a much lower priority for us to move forward with compared to the exponentially rising technical debt that we were accruing.

It's always the small things you get wrong. Even small things like forgetting ask for a insignificant detail you'll get fired if you do that 3 times. They required you do get your stats while get all necessary and redundant details but make sure you finish the call in 3 minutes. That's not possible you can't do both. They even went as far to have a new system added that tracks the tone of your voice how long it takes you to respond and so on. We aren't robots we're human beings. The box just kept getting smaller and smaller to the point you feel like mindless drone with the ridiculous rules they add. You're expected to log on early to start your shift but if you try and log off a minute of two sooner so you don't get stuck on a 20 minute call before your shift ends you get in trouble. Time off was impossible. You had to fight to the death there was never enough hours because of the high turn over rate. And holidays they claim you get them off but you have to work most of them because they don't have enough employees to cover themselves. Once the pandemic started we were sent to work home and I had no choice but to work at my apartment . I would get blamed if my power or internet would go out. Their server devices were garbage because they weren't big enough to handle people working at home and we got punished if those went down and wouldn't get paid/take PTO without permission to cover that. If you were sick you were made to feel guilty for taking time off and kept asking when you were going to comeback. If you needed to get up to go to the bathroom you would get in trouble for going over the 3 minutes allowed and were told to wait until lunch. I had a health problem where I needed to use the bathroom an even had a diagnosis and doctor's note but I was told they don't do medical accommodations. That is discrimination. Finally I quit. And 6 months later I'm doing great at my new job and they decide to rip me anew one one more times and say I owe over $400 for unused pto even though I was told that would be taken care of. you waited 6 months later to tell me. right before I'm about to buy a house and I get the letter The DAY before it's due.

Some are quick to make assumptions before they gather the evidence.  Working in a high call volume environment, you will quickly learn that there are peers that you prefer to speak with over others.

The majority of pharmacists act like speaking to a patient care advocate is beneath them. System issues can result in ruining the work experience. High call volumes can be stressful, especially when patient care advocates are asked to keep up with all of their emails as well as assist fellow peers who may seek assistance when they have an issue or do not understand a concept. Pay is relatively low when compared to competitors. Raise is more like a cost of living adjustment. No raise was given in 2021, just a meager bonus for $600. The other incentives that they provide are conditional and certain metrics have to be met. More money comes in the form of overtime, where they are quick to offer when it is available. Team leaders will drop what they are doing to ensure that overtime needs are met.

Depending on which department you work in, you may have remote access and the ability to work from home. I have made some wonderful friends in my time with ESI and I have a great team that I work with.", "cons": "ESI is a culture of passing the buck, going for the cheapest solution even if it isn't the right solution, expecting 110% devotion to your job above all else and allowing favoritism to determine your advancement. \r\n\r\nThere is no accountability unless you are low man on the totem pole, in which case everything is your fault and you are expected to fix everything even when you aren't provided the systems or permissions to do so. \r\n\r\nTeam members are constantly pitted against each other due to how reviews are done where someone has to be rated below threshold even when all team members have performed well.\r\n\r\nThe entire merger has been a disaster. Migrating clients to a system that isn't supported well and doesn't offer anywhere close to the flexibility of our old system has made for frustration and animosity between Legacy Medco employees and Legacy ESI employees. Customers are less than happy with all of it as well, but upper management continues to act like this merger has been perfect and anyone who says differently is labeled as not being a team player and has their lives made very difficult.\r\n\r\nEvery person I work with is expected to do what equates to at least 2 people's jobs (except the \"favorites\" who get away with doing next to nothing and spending large portions of their day BS-ing with management). Pay does not reflect the added responsibilities. Extended hours are just expected for salaried employees including weekends, holidays and even when they are technically on vacation or on PTO. For hourly employees, overtime is not allowed (in my area), yet all work is still expected to be done in the allotted 40 hours when realistically there is 50 or more hours of work per week assigned. Hourly employees are bullied about even minutes of OT. Stress levels are ridiculous and I personally know of 4 co-workers who have gone on either anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medications within the last year because of ESI.\r\n\r\nWhen you somehow manage to succeed and meet the ridiculous expectations, you are not rewarded or promoted...you are given more work and maybe an \"atta boy\" or \"atta girl\" if you are lucky. If you complain about any of the workload, you are none too subtly told that you are replaceable and that you should be grateful you even have a job. (references to the Legacy Medco employees who have been let go are not uncommon when complaints are voiced)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the constant threat of being \"laid off\" if you don't kill yourself to meet the unreasonable expectations has fostered a community that lives in fear of making a mistake or saying even the smallest of things that can be taken as not toeing the company line. Since nobody wants their name attached to even the smallest mistake, nobody is willing to take any responsibility for anything, make any decisions that may elicit change of any kind or speak up when they see something being done wrong. Finger pointing, passing the buck and throwing your co-workers under the bus has almost become company policy when something goes wrong.\r\n\r\nThe pathetic attempts by ESI to show they appreciate their employees are just that...pathetic. I don't want free cupcakes or donuts every other month during a 2 hour window where you have to go down to the lunchroom area and wait in line to get said cupcake. I don't want a $1 store keychain flashlight that stops working within days. I don't want another cheap backpack or coffee mug with ESI blazoned all over it. I don't care that you dedicate a day each month to wearing our favorite sports team's shirt. that doesn't tell me ESI appreciates me. It tells me that they have no clue about what it means to really appreciate their employees or show them even the slightest respect. It is borderline insulting as I feel it treats me like a small child who can be distracted away from all of the horrible mess that ESI has become by a sugary treat or cheap item thrown my way every now and again. \r\n\r\nSeeing the huge bonuses that George Paz has gotten the last few years as well as his overall compensation package makes me feel sick. During that same time period I have been told \"no bonuses this year because of the merger\", \"we can only offer up to a 3% raise because according to market research, we've been overpaying our employees and this should bring salaries back in line with the average\" and \"our budget can't support promoting anyone in the department\". Really? Because Mr.Paz and upper management don't seem to have trouble finding it in the budget to give themselves pay raises and bonuses every year. Why is it only us peons that have to give up compensation during a merger or budget crunch? Oh. that's right. It's because we don't matter to upper management. We are that gunk stuck to the bottom of their shoe that they can't be bothered to scrape off, but certainly don't acknowledge as anything worthwhile.\r\n\r\nAnd on the subject of Mr.Paz, I really do not care for the emails he sends out telling us how we should be voting on certain issues when they come up on the ballot or to call our Congressman or State Legislators and tell them to vote a certain way on issues. Just because that ballot item may be good for ESI, that doesn't mean that it is good for me and my family or reflect my own personal beliefs. Stop trying to push me to vote in a certain way! \r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as a work/life balance at ESI. If you attempt to maintain a life outside of your job, you are quickly relegated to the sidelines and you have no hope of ever advancing or being taken seriously."}, {"review_title": "Treat very capable employees with disrespect based on management goals to get ahead and receive big bonuses to cut staff", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "25 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Training Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent benefits.

For most of those years, things weren't bad (although there were certainly were frustrations).  However, the culture has become very, very sour after the Medco merger 2 years ago, and good people have been leaving in droves ever since.\r\n\r\nThe internal politics at the company have gotten so thick that it is nearly impossible to get anything done.  On one hand, you have the legacy ESI folks, many of whom have grown up with the company.  On the other hand, you have the legacy Medco folks who remain resentful that their company got bought, and who seem to have an unhealthy distrust for anything coming out of St. Louis.  The two companies continue to operate under the ESI umbrella, and they both have some representation in leadership.  The sad part is, that the two sides don't cooperate at all, and tend to sabotage each other at every opportunity.  Cooperation is rare, and senior leadership doesn't force either side to compromise or take direction.\r\n\r\nIf you come up with a better way of doing things at ESI, it will be fully your responsibility to convince *everyone* in the east and the west that the change needs to happen. Unfortunately, this is an impossible task due to the amount of red tape involved, and the ongoing divide between the legacy companies. From an IT perspective, this means that their technology stack is completely antiquated, and there is little hope of moving the company forward.  This also leads to a situation where nearly everyone believes that the company doesn't value them at all, and it has become incredibly difficult to do a good job and make things better, even if you want to. This unfortunately leads to a situation where very few people work hard at all, and almost nothing ever gets done.\r\n\r\nAll of this frustration has led to an environment where a sense of discontent permeates through the hallways. Behind closed doors, most employees have very little respect for the company or for senior leadership, and things seem to only be getting worse. When surrounded by such negativity day after day, it really starts to affect your mood and outlook, even when you aren't working. To make matters worse, many talented people have already left the company, and because of a sour reputation around town, replacing them with talented individuals has become nearly impossible.  \r\n\r\nFrom a culture perspective, there is virtually none at ESI.  Very few people get together outside of the office, and the only company get-togethers are formulaic employee-only lunches (one in the winter, one in the summer), where drinking is prohibited and families aren't invited. The St. Louis offices are in a terrible part of town, and most people look forward to leaving the area as quickly as possible after the work day."}, {"review_title": "Good benefits, good hours, cold management, horrible pay for exhausting work.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Nov 2013", "job_title": "Certified Pharmacy Technician in Whitestown, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The hours are fair, overtime is encouraged and the benefits are great.", "cons": "The pay is awful for pharmacy techs, considering the amount of work they are expected to perform.
