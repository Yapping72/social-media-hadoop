Biogen can't train their people appropriately so mediocre people engage in bad habits creating nothing but recurring problems. HR is only here to save them and given the mass exodus of HR folks, they already have. Applying to Biogen should only be an option for a very short term (6 months) before moving on to something else. This is not the place to grow your career. This is not the place to be if you are disabled, or a woman, or a member of the BIPOC community. The microaggressions and gaslighting are at an all time high and the new CEO is only fueling it by saying that he will not do layoffs but rely on natural attrition that occurs from the change in policy around hybrid work and the removal of employee benefits like Wellness week. The start of the new CEO has ushered in an about face era. Last year, the employee was essential to Biogen success. This year, Biogen needs to focus on creating value for the stakeholders.

As a Contract RA you don't speak with Biogen management directly, but rather to a proxy contract recruiting organization. They also pay you, so make sure to button up the details of your pay when you start, and if you believe you have something more to offer than you're worth, Biogen may be desperate enough to negotiate for that. The team you're on will truly treat you the same as a salaried hire which is respectful of them. At the same time, it is difficult because you may work just as hard as full-time employees but not be compensated as well. Also, your team may not be great so being treated the same is not necessarily good. The chances are high that your manager will be very cagey about if they can offer you a full-time position, so if you end up doing good work and are there for a while it will probably be frustrating. The other con is that because you are employed in this weird zone you'll feel \"siloed\" in your team, in a situation where no one outside your team wants to interact with you.

The annual review cycle is also quite brutal.

After a managment change it was apparent to me they had promoted a great individual contributor to a management role and it was not good for anybody.  To give a view on the insanity, my new boss flew from MA to our site to \"support\" us for the transition where we were required to show up the next day to work to get the critical news on the move forward.  The boss expected all of us to stay out until 6AM drinking.  This ended up being a vacation and drinkng visit, and not at all about the transition.  We never discussed the transition with our new boss.  Needless to say the majority of us couldn't make it to the most critical meeting of our working lives and frankly it was embarassing that our group didn't show up to get the information. This was not the only time that we were expected to drink until we passed out when she was in town.  I am not a square, but would have like to use our time with the boss for something other than huge drink-a-thons our touring her around the country for her vacation at least once in a while.  When I finally said I can stay out but need to get back by 1AM since I have a family and need to work the next mornings, I was immediately thrown out of the inner circle.  It was the same picture for the team in MA.  They were expected to go on vacations and drinking with the boss and if they ever said no, then they were also thrown outside the inner circle.  At the end the only people getting promotions were the single team members. Having said all that, I do not begrudge the single team members who recognized that this was the only way to get promoted and there are always bad managers but the experience at BIIB overall was good.  Now that I am not in the situation at BIIB it is clear to me that there were a lot of good people BIIB, along with some poor promoting practices that allowed peple that should never manage people to direct their careers.

When we launched a new drug, all of Cambridge went to Fenway Park to celebrate and cavort for hours, leaving work early and partying into the evening. In RTP, we celebrated in the Biogen courtyard from 12-2 and then wen't back to work. They were nice enough to provide us with a Fenway Park backdrop, in case we wanted to have a picture taken for the \"Outta The Park!\" theme.

Work life balance is nonexistent and there is constant pressure to work overtime hours simply because leadership sets unrealistic goals and expectations. There is no transparency and policies are very subjective to the deferment of employees. Employees are afraid to speak up, disagree with manage my without fear of backlash and blackballing. employees are treated like elementary school students meaning you have to code yourself to be able to use bathroom take breaks or eat lunch. You can be questioned for any bathroom use that is considers 'excessive'. Employees are penalized for taking time from work to care for themselves and their family. Wonder vacation benefits but senior leadership has right threshold of how many people can be off a day. Many have lost days of vacation time because of this. Builds wrong behaviors in people because of unrealistic attendance policy. No work from home opportunities unless it is to the advantage of the business. Culture is based on fear and entirely different than corporate and manufacturing departments. Other than great benefits no real incentive to work there. Growth in patient services is nonexistent as managers demand that employees use their vacation or work overtime for any development or job shadowing opportunities.  Senior managers is system that promotes bullying and intimidation.  Employees are held accountable to departmental goals and metrics that change throughout the year without communication.  Patient services seems to have lost its purpose and line of sight. It has gone from a company that truly cared about patients on Biogen therapies to that of hustling tactics to get patients to switch from other medication to Biogen therapies and pressuring them to stay on a bygone medication. It is ALL about the bottom line. Goal seems to be to get one person to work as 3 individuals. Did I mention NO WORK LIFE BALANCE!  Would rather employees to work 6days a week simply because management does not how to delegate. Promotions are not based on experience and skill set but rather who knows and if they like you. Very high school environment where popularity and who you know is the only way to move up the ladder. In conclusion, if you are looking for an employer who does not value your work, overlooks you from promotions, expects you to live at work, penalizes you for not coming to work when you or family member is sick, requires you to provide calculation of time used away for bathroom use and lunch use, does not allow you to use vacation hours, pushes for you to work on company holidays, operates on bully system and cowardly coaching, views being late to work 1min the same as 4hrs and gives out demerits for it, no work from home opportunists, no transparency, tyrannical rule, and a strong disconnect of what employees do then working at Patient Services with Biogen is just for you."}, {"review_title": "morale down due to restructurings and lack of transparency", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Feb 2017", "job_title": "Senior Manager in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "benefits\npay\nlocation\ninfrastructure office layout\ncleanliness of office ( except for the mice running around in building 1)\ncafeteria/ starbucks on site", "cons": "gossiping at your manager level\nfavoritism \nlack of respect \nlack of recognition\nlack of transparency \nunprofessional\nfailing trend on revenues at each earnings"}, {"review_title": "good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Jun 2010", "job_title": "Research Associate in Morrisville, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Like anywhere you had some people who were really good to work with, the pay was good and the management was really good about being fair and treated you like a person.", "cons": "The only con that I have is that at times my workload would take a good chunk of my personal time away.

Do not question decisions otherwise you will be branded a complainer who does not follow policies.\n\nJob responsibilities: The position used to be gratifying, you felt like you were really helping the patient. Sadly, this is no longer the case. You are expected to read from scripts and will be penalized for veering off the script.  The only priority you have is the one that is told to you, you are no longer required to use your brain or the skills that got you the job.\n\nTechnology: The \"technology\" we use is antiquated and fails often,  instead of continuing with the plan of upgrading all of our technology we continue to put bandaids on the current old system and expect coordinators to use many work arounds. You are still held accountable for the calls you didn't make/take even when the system fails.\n\nCommunication: Added responsibilities and changing priorities are communicated via many emails. Your inbox will be inundated with constant emails of what you are expected to do that day and the daily changing priorities.  It is difficult to keep up with all the emails. Meetings held are to provide us with additional responsibilities and again the ever changing priorities they want to make sure we saw in the email. \n\nGrowth: minimal. During the interview they will talk about the growth of the company and the chance to learn and succeed. Opportunities within the organization. This is not a lie but not quite true, if you are friends with someone in leadership or have been \"chosen\" (with or without merit) you will advance. Unfortunately, if you are not in the category mentioned you will stay where you are and continue to be micromanaged until you either become complacent or bored and tired of being treated like a child and leave.\n\nTraining: On your own and on your own time (if approved and your deemed worthy of training for advancement) not possible to be done as OT.  OT should be used to make/take calls only. \n\n(All of this is dependent on your supervisor/manager, if you are lucky enough to have a supportive person in your corner you will have a different experience)."}, {"review_title": "Terrible work/life balance", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Mar 2016", "job_title": " in Somerville, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours are a nice perk, although...

Biogen also speaks of \"Caring Deeply\", but that must only apply to the patients they want to start their therapy and not the employees.

There is no conversation, empathy, or sympathy allowed because it will lead to having to report adverse events. I can't even believe the amount of READING this position has to do. Nothing sounds natural. You can't even ask them how they are doing. If I were the patient calling in, I would hang up because the amount that has to be read is over and above what they want/need to hear & will not always answer the questions asked.
