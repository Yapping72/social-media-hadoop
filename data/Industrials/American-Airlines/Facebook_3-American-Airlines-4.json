We were also told that training would be 2.5 days so we all made arrangements based on that information. We did not receive final confirmation of training until Sunday afternoon letting us know that training would start the next day for a full week. I thought it might be a misunderstanding (based on the 2.5 days previously mentioned), and figured I would ask in person. \r\nFirst day of training, we find out it is actually 2 full weeks. The first week we were there anywhere from 2-4hrs a day, doing absolutely nothing while the \"trainers\" were in and out of the classroom. The O'hare \"trainers\" know absolutely nothing, not figuratively, they literally had no information about anything. Finally at the end of the week we start working on lessons online. At the end of week 1 we finally receive a bid sheet with numbered slots to fill out and they let us know shifts are all 5hrs a day, 5 days a week and granted based on seniority. Up to this point, none of us had any idea what the required hours or days were. This is when they explain that scheduling is not flexible at all, you are required to work whatever shift they award you. The CAR position is new to AA and therefore not fully staffed. This means, you will have to bid frequently (approx every 5 weeks) as they \"play around\" with the schedule to determine what works best for them. Every bid has had different start times, end times, lunch schedules and days off. It has been completely inconsistent.\r\n\r\nWeek 2, We have out of town trainers come in, they are awesome and share valuable information. Unfortunately, we only had them for a couple of days. Once they were gone, we were back at the mercy of the O'hare \"trainers\". \r\n\r\nThe lack of information does not stop there, once you are out on the floor you will find that nobody has an answer to any of your questions. It takes an act of God to receive your uniforms from the vendor. The vendor will blame AA and AA will blame the vendor. You will go back and forth until you give up all hope of having a uniform. Good luck getting an answer from the attendance department if you have an issue with the new system they just switched to. Also, once you work here, forget about making any plans or having a life because, even though you are part time (25hrs /week) you might not receive your bid until a few days before the new schedule starts.

Work From Home\n2. US Airways shines a nice limelight", "cons": "1. Low start pay compared to our piers at other Airlines. \n2. Lateral promotions assured, with an assurance of no pay increase for the added responsibility and work load. \n3. The biggest problem I disliked.  Is that they built tiers to divide the reservation dept into sectors.  Last time I checked BMAS was \"tier 2\" with additional pay. \n4. If you move to Aadvantage Reservations you'll automatically be  \"BMAS back up\"... and yes its exactly what it sounds . Get screamed at by disgruntled passangers with delayed bags and they will not pay you more cause your technically \"tier 1\" still. \n5. Home Based Position is not as flexible as when you start in domestic sales. After you move laterally to either Domestic Aadvantage or International Sales you will have less priority with shift bids. \n6. The company will not pay for the Internet required for the Home Based Position, however insists that everyone in your household remains off your entire Internet access during work hours. \n7. Flight benefits are useless after you are trained in Aadvantage plus the added \"BMAS back up\", because those departments are always busy.  In addition to the strict policy they have on attendance, the only people that travel are my guests with D3 passes. \n8. Got an emergency?  Or need a day off ? forget it, if you call in its an unexcused absence with an occurance, guaranteed discussion with a supervisor."}], [{"review_title": "It was bitter sweet.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "28 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Customer Service Supervisor in Fort Worth, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A top notch airline, flies all over the world, proud to be an employee of an industry leader.", "cons": "Lower and middle management could be petty and foolish.
