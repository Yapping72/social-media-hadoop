Management only seems to care about how their metrics are viewed by their superiors and will dump unsustainable amounts of work on their workers. Helpdesk offers support over phone and chat, you will be doing both SIMULTANEOUSLY. Handling chats and phone calls at the same time while management is dumping new responsibilities that we have no training on. Needless to say this was a NIGHTMARE work environment. We worked from home for about 18 months which everyone loved and made work more bearable. Once they were able to force people back in the office they did. Even overnight people who had to drive to an empty office where managers don't even show up and sit alone in an office for 8-10 hours, have no interaction with co-workers cause you are on the phone 24/7, then drive home. I had maybe 5 meetings over the course of those 3 years, there is no \"Collaboration\". I spoke with dozens of 25+ years employees who were checked out, just running down the clock waiting to retire. They couldn't believe what this company has turned into and told me to get out ASAP.\n\nI dodged COVID for 2 years nearly and got it twice within the first 3 months back in the office. Management would dump all the work on us resulting from poor management decisions and give us nothing in return. They say they care about their employees but won't even let us work at home which not only costs them nothing, it saves them money, and saves us money! Right before I left they announced they were giving raises out finally! After nearly 3 years of nothing (outside of a company-wide 3% raise) we were finally going to get what we deserve! The raises were 2%-5% based on performance. Don't worry though, once a year you will get dominos for employee appreciation day. \n\n\nP.S.\nAlso job opportunities outside of Dallas are scarce and people in those roles are lifers. \nFlight Benefits are great, but that's all you get.

We have yet to sit through the loads of virtual training we are due to begin in order to be allowed work with guests. Our first day, there was a town hall meeting and a very awkward drama played out between a manager and a few of the customer service agents. The environment was very negative and hostile and it felt like these toxic dramatics were the norm for the employees. \r\n\r\nApart from that weirdness, the so called \u201cpart time schedule\u201d is really a full time schedule in disguise. I have not had a conversation with a single manager or supervisor about my availability or preferred schedule. They don\u2019t give you much of a choice. The flight benefits seem pretty nonexistent for regular lower level employees starting out, as they discourage you from taking advantage of them until after 6 months. Pretty sickening considering the kind of hellish schedule they demand you work. They actively you discourage you from taking outside work which is virtually impossible for me because I have numerous other opportunities for earning money in another sector on a freelance basis. \r\n\r\nHonestly, after 3 days of \u201cwork\u201d here, I think that AA is run like cult.
