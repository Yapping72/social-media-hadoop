Because they do this, every gate is full of irate people so the agents are stressed and take it out on you. There is seldom comradery between employees. I get treated better as a non-rev on other airlines and try to avoid flying on AA- even if it means paying. Agents will throw you under the bus if there is a delay- they will blame you on the PA. \r\n\r\nPassengers had become increasingly more hostile since 2016- which correlates with the drastic, polarizing change of political landscape in this country. The same people now think that wearing a mask is against their \"constitutional rights\" and now have a violent mob mentality.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started, there were longer layovers and fewer flights per day. Then when the merge with US Airways happened, we started getting 3-4 flights per day with just enough time in the destination to eat, sleep, and do it all over again.\r\n\r\nSenior flight attendants are slow to adapt, grossly incompetent yet take all the good trips. If they'd interviewed between 2012-2022, a lot of these people would not make the cut. They were hired for their looks and the job market was less competitive. Newhires are more educated, level-headed and culturally sensitive. But have to deal with Seniors talking about how they \"paid their dues\" when they got to experience 20+ years of the job being enjoyable, easier and worth it.\r\n\r\nYou can't make plans- flexibility is difficult because you have no control. \r\n\r\nIt is a dead end job, unless you are willing to move to godforsaken Texas and deal with incompetent management.\r\n\r\nThe pay is HORRENDOUS. I was always broke. Like the military, they put you wherever they need you. But unlike the military if you live in expensive places like San Francisco, New York or Boston, there is no pay differential.

I feel welcomed here and there are a lot of Employee Business Resources Groups from all identities and they\u2019re pretty active. Our executive leadership are also active in some of the events the EBRGs organize which is refreshing and inspiring to see.\n\n- Leadership especially middle management is very diverse. It\u2019s one thing for companies (especially other airlines) that claim they\u2019re diverse but that number mostly comes from front lines employees. But to also see diversity in leadership is truly inspiring.\n\n- I truly feel like our executive leadership cares about each employee. \n\n- Our travel benefits are not seniority base unlike most other airlines, so it\u2019s beneficial for younger or more junior employees. My partner and I have been everywhere including international destinations and most times, business class. Domestic is definitely more tricky but you\u2019re still able to make it work.\n\n- The mentors I have met here and the people willing to connect with you over a 30 minute coffee chat have been amazing. They\u2019re so willing to help younger employees like myself. I\u2019ve seen some of my colleagues even network with VPs and I feel that\u2019s rare for such a large company. \n\n- Most people you meet traveling are wonderful, friendly and look out for you as a teammate. This is true for gate agents, flight attendants, etc.", "cons": "- Certain departments like mine are still pretty old school. It\u2019s not as diverse as the company as a whole. \n\n- Huge company so it\u2019s hard to make an impact in most of your projects \n\n- Our product, service standards and operations need a lot of improvement \n\n- Leadership needs to stop being so reactive and think of ways AA can lead the pack rather than waiting to see what other airlines are doing \n\n- Corporate Coms need to do a better job in communicating new product, services and enhancements. They need to highlight the stories that make American a wonderful company. I truly believe in the company and it just needs to be conveyed to the public."}, {"review_title": "It was good until it wasn\u2019t", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flight travel benefits for employees", "cons": "Oversold flights angry passengers stressful environment"}, {"review_title": "Amazing career for travel, flexibility, and benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "14 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Flight Attendant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Second highest paying airline for flight attendants\r\n- Unionized with a decent contract\r\n- Travel perks (on the job and during time off) all over the world\r\n- 401K and health benefits\r\n- Flexibility with schedule (able to drop, trade, pickup trips)", "cons": "- Reserve, although with a few years of seniority it improves dramatically\r\n- Commuting (if you commute out of base)\r\n- Being away from home during some holidays\r\n- Every so often dealing with upset/irate passengers"}, {"review_title": "review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flight benefits and flexible schedule", "cons": "work hours can fluctuate as early as 3am or working as late as 1am"}, {"review_title": "No growth - poor corporate culture", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flight Benefits, talented colleagues, work life balance", "cons": "Base salary is not very competitive.
