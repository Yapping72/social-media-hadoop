You are expected to be a mind reader and \"on-call\" at all times. They don't tell you during the interview that required OT involves weekends *and* holidays. In over 15 years in accounting and finance, this is the first organization that has required me to work on all major holidays. Work/life balance means we will allow you to recoup your time later, but family and friends are rarely able to wait for a week or two until you can recoup your time to take off and celebrate with them. Almost everyone in the Global Ops Center in downtown Cincinnati is new. This means that very few people really have a solid framework of information about the organization in order to make informed decisions or to inform others in their decisions. I quickly learned to not take other people at their word as most are quick to give the impression that their opinion is correct without considering that the siloed nature of information within this organization makes it nearly impossible for any one person to fundamentally know anything about which they speak if it isn't in reference to their microscopically specific responsibilities. The workspace is touted as a collaborative environment, and yet it does not lend itself well to collaboration among team members without finding a meeting space. Alternatively, there is not privacy or quiet space for thinking unless you grab a phone room. Perhaps workspaces within each group would allow for more active huddling. Functions within the same business are spread out over several different floors and spaces, where having everyone sit together in the same space would make more logical sense from a collaboration standpoint. Departments and functions feel very disjointed. \"Change is the only constant\" is a favorite phrase around the office, but the momentum of change that is occurring doesn't allow for people to adapt and become experts at anything before moving on to the next shiny system or tool meant to \"streamline\" processes...that no one has even had an opportunity to establish in the first place. \"Not your grandpa's GE\" is also another favorite phrase. While I admire progress and innovation, perhaps taking some notes from Grandpa's GE with regards to structure, guidelines and foundational organizational processes would have been beneficial instead of sending Grandpa to the nursing home and essentially writing him off. Bigger is not always better. They lure applicants in with attractive salaries only for them to find out that 60+ work weeks are the norm and the salary isn't that lucrative at all, once you do the math. Benefits are industry norm - nothing to write home about. Employees must pay for their own parking (GE discount)."}, {"review_title": "Terrific resume value --- great to start your career not for mid career switches unless you are senior enough !", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Jan 2009", "job_title": "CAS Associate in Stamford, CT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "GE's resume value is terrific.

For example, business reps and project managers would aggressively court customers (they are incentivized by bonuses), promising highly unrealistic delivery dates and prices, and once a deal is signed they would simply throw it over the fence for engineering to \"figure it out\". Many projects start in this way, far over budget and behind schedule from the start. It is almost as if projects are planned to fail from the start, but just by a little bit. In this manner, they are able to squeeze every ounce of energy and motivation from the teams, knowing that if the team fails to mitigate the problems sufficiently that they will be held accountable and fired. Along these lines, the customer is often delivered a 90% mature product, with known flaws, and then later pressured by the commercial reps and legal teams into signing maintenance contracts or additional services to fix these problems that are usually well known by GE\r\n\r\nRegarding management and executive leaders, there are some very strong people. However, because the culture is such that firing, lay-offs (where they immediately re-post the position), and disciplinary actions such as the so-called Performance Improvement Plan, are so common many managers are compelled to protect themselves rather than help their subordinates or others. Another issue is new managers being brought in to GE that are so out of touch with the organization, product line, and culture, but they must either blindly discipline or fire people, or risk suffering that fate themselves. I have seen a few very good long term employees (15+ years) get pushed out the door in this way. \r\n\r\nIn short, it is a very rough culture to be a part of.

If you are in a business that is doing well, you MIGHT be okay but even then there are too-frequent seismic shifts. Several times in my career I created amazing teams with clear purpose, uptake, and customer impact, but constant change always seemed to disrupt forward momentum short of the potential.  Of all the people I've worked with, I would say that ~80% were pushed out for one reason or another. Very few make it to natural retirement. GE still CAN be a good place to spend a few years, but is probably best viewed as a launch pad.

Basically each employee is required to do an internal resume of their qualifications, experience, accomplishments for the year, and your perceived strengths and weaknesses.  Then the EMS is reviewed by your manager and your manager's manager.  Your manager then does a counter-point to your listed accomplishments (or if you're well aware of your strengths and faults your manager will just agree with you), then you sit down privately with your manager to discuss views.  It really give the employee a chance to trumpet themselves to management, but it is really tough when you're fairly humble.\r\n\r\nRegular raises, about every 18 month for most employees, every 12 months for the \"Top Talent\" in the company.\r\n\r\nGreat Benefits, the usual health, dental, vision, 401k, and vacation, plus discount programs for company products (what does GE not make, honestly) and partners.\r\n\r\nVast internal job opportunities, with so many divisions and locations in GE, there is a lot of potential places to go within the company.\r\n\r\nAmbitious growth of the company, that so far has been sustained for a few years now.  Sustained double-digit revenue growth year over year is phenomenal for any company.\r\n\r\nRecent addition of CTO position over Engineering.  Having an Engineer administrating the technical aspects of the company is the right thing to do.  Having an advocate for the technical people in the company is a great thing.

I'm not sure what the problem is with having lots of small facilities, but management hates it like the plague, so they keep cutting facilities.  They seem to either consider people to be disposable, or somehow expect their whole workforce to be so loyal that they'll move anywhere from 50 to 2000 miles to keep their jobs.  Or they instead will just remove the facility entirely and move it to where labor is cheap, not seeming to care how long it will take to recoup the investment to move the manufacturing, nor the loss of good-will and respect with their customers and employees.\r\n\r\nLean workforce and getting leaner.  Every time I think we're a skeleton crew, they find more flesh to remove.  Whether through attrition or layoffs, each time people go, they're not replaced, but somehow we're supposed to get just as much done.\r\n\r\nFar more outside managers hired than people promoted within.  This is actually double-edged, because sometimes outside people are needed to break the status quo, but we need to be weeding out the incompetence, not bringing in fresh supplies of it.\r\n\r\nWe at least get regular raises, which is better than some companies, but with the 18 month frequency for most employees, the raises don't keep up with inflation.  The only way to get a real pay raise is to change jobs.\r\n\r\nMinimal upward mobility.

Salary increases are not significant (1-3% every 18mths) unless you change jobs and negotiate your pay in a stellar way.  \r\n\r\nGE summarizes the qualities of a great leader into what they call the \u201c4 Es\u201d.  Energy, Energize, Execution and Edge.  In theory they look great but in practice they are a disaster.  Most of the managers think that practicing Energy/Energize is intimidating the teams to do what needs to get done.  When it comes to having \u201cedge\u201d its very well known that it translates to \u201cbeing an ass\u201d.  Don\u2019t take me wrong, I have seen people practice all of them flawlessly and be excellent leaders\u2026 but it\u2019s by no means the norm around here."}, {"review_title": "GE - Is A good place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Feb 2009", "job_title": "Mechanical Engineer in Albany, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "GE is a learning environment.

They are certainly not a resource.\r\n\r\n-The head of HR for a large US Corp (relative of mine) once told me that GE (and most big companies) HR's two main goals:  1) Reduce cost.    2) Push the envelop (salary, tough metrics, etc.) with employees just enough without getting sued.\r\n\r\n-Nepotism runs rampant ...people are in positions they don't belong in.     It's like a cancer that is spreading.\r\n\r\n-No use of 360 review system...it exists but not used.\r\n  \r\n-Way too much turnover of positions...people move up before they are ready or laterally into a position they shouldn't be in because they never performed it themselves.\r\n  \r\n-Most managers have never held the same role as their direct reports....how can you lead people if you have not done the job yourself?     GE hires many veterans.    In the military, a leader must know how to do the job above them and below them.   Not at GE.     I've seen many ex miltary leave GE, frustrated, after a short while because the style and structure of management is so upside down. \r\n\r\n-Internal evaluation system is abused by HR.    Some have described as fuzzy.     I would equate it with quicksand.    No matter what you do positive only negativity prevails....and it's used as leverage against your salary action or rating (rack and stack).    HR requires managers to post two things you must improve upon every year..   Anything can be written by a manager and once it's in the system it is there for perpetuity even if comments are completely wrong and you post a rebuttal with your side of the story.   Only the \"negative\" comments carry on into view of future hiring managers....the rebuttal comments by the employee do not.     An employee's only recourse is to never acknowledge (checking a box) that you held a discussion with your manager.  Checking that box says you agree with whatever they wrote in their assessment.     Well, there is the option of hiring outside legal counsel to correct this but that is HIGHLY discouraged...in fact there is an agreement you acknowledge (a check box on a website basically) that says you cannot hire legal counsel for employment disputes...you have to use one of HR's Ombudsmen (an HR manager from some other dept)....they'll basically rule for HR and not for you just about 100% of the time.\r\nAs for the fuzzy metrics.....that is a game played by HR and they are masters of bait and switch and slight of hand.       \r\n\r\n-There is no clear structure in the leadership chain....too many \"dotted\" line managers.\r\n\r\n-Tons of backstabbing."}, {"review_title": "Leadership needs to focus on more than just the bottom line.

Those who try to work 40 hours a week are typically out of the company in less than 2 years.\r\nIn addition to the lack of training and work-life balance, employees of GE are typically paid less than their counterparts at major competitors.  Because GE has such a strong reputation world-wide, GE Human Resources managers know they can offer less to employees, expect more out of them, and people will still come and work for GE, at least in the short-term.\r\nBecause of the lack of training, work-life balance, and adequate pay, the turnover I've seen at GE has been very high.  I have seen 2 managers and 3 sales engineers leave in the last 3 years.

You will probably be stuck with the boring work nobody else has the time to do.  If you are interested in a direct hire position in this economic situation, forget it.  There is no incentive to improve the intern program because most of the interns will not be hired for full-time positions.  \r\n\r\nManagement that is several pay bands above you calls the shots.  For the technical engineer, there is little room for creativity.  It is hard to quantify job performance in technical engineering roles as compared with manufacturing roles.  GE is resistant to change as seen in some analysis tools used that are decades old.  Many engineers are unhappy with their assignments and are overworked.  They stick around because they are married and GE provides a stable job.  You are expected to work more than 40 hours a week with no overtime pay so that deadlines are met.

There is a lack of long term vision of where want products to go, what customers want to serve, and how to get there.  Long term projects struggle for years with little leadership engagement, and then leaders become surprised when crunch time comes and deadlines are missed.  There is a lack of communication between leaders of different organizations, locations, etc.  Professional confrontation that is sometimes required to resolve an issue is always pushed down to the engineer level for resolution, leaders are terrified to (professionally) confront another leader for fear of bad labels... in other words, there is a big incentive to keep things swept under the carpet.\r\n\r\nIncredible amount of bureaucracy.  Simple tasks that used to take an educated decision by a few smart engineers with some involvement of some more senior engineers now require multiple levels of managers, consulting engineers, chief engineers, technical leaders, etc.  Chief engineers have a very confrontational tone as well as have difficultly in accepting new ideas but at the same relentlessly push their new ideas even though not completely thought through.\r\n\r\nPowerPoint culture.  Inordinate amount of time spent in PowerPoint.  In theory the idea is that the PowerPoint slides summarize your work in order to communicate progress, risks, etc.  Instead, all of the good engineering work that was done has to be force fit into a presentation tool so that the disengaged leadership chain and levels of bureaucracy can try to understand the basic concepts of what is going on.  If you are good at PowerPoint you can go far in GE, but if you want to continue to sharpen your engineering skills you will otherwise find that they will become rusty mostly due to this.\r\n\r\nDifficult to get through to real customers.  If you had previous industry experience, will likely be more comfortable in ability to make decisions, understand what is going on, and push for what you think is right for customers.  Otherwise, customer's needs are filtered and passed down through multiple layers, ultimately leading to lowered customer expectations.  Additionally, a culture has developed amongst those with less direct industry and customer experience, where they have become leaders that are setting direction for product offerings, design decisions, etc but clearly are missing the mark.  This in turn also leads to the previous comment of rusty engineering skills, where the rank-and-file become out of touch with industry standards, customer expectations, etc.  Additionally, things such as attending a conference or sitting on an industry standards board are reserved for a select few.\r\n\r\nLack of team mentality.  This is something simply have to accept in a 'meritocracy' such as GE.  You are constantly conscious of your yearly EMS (yearly personnel review process), where more or less have to create a resume of accomplishments every year.  On the surface it makes sense to put down your accomplishments to refresh the minds of those who determine pay raises, but it is clear that once it goes up one or two layers in the chain of command that any great individual or team efforts become less significant in lieu of name recognition.\r\n\r\nHopefully didn't come across as too negative.  In general probably on par with other large corporations.  However, currently falling behind our competition, leadership is currently on a down-slide, but as in everything in GE this can go in cycles and has the ability to improve if becomes a recognized problem."}, {"review_title": "Great experience offering poor pay, grinding work hours and little advancement opportunities.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Jul 2011", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "GE is a highly respected company that looks great on the resume\r\nExposure to many different  processes and technologies\r\nLot's to do, never get bored, since your doing the job of at least three people\r\nOK benefits except for medical. 401K match and GE is one of the few companies with pensions, but recent hires only get crummy cash value benefit.\r\nTraining opportunities are generally good\r\nEveryone works hard, most people are helpful, slackers are a rare exception\r\nDirect managers are supportive and helpful", "cons": "Pay is not just poor and not even close to industry averages, it's down right insulting given the level of skill and how much work is required.\r\nForget about bonuses or even a little over time pay for a 60 hour week and whole weekends given to the company \r\nPay increases don't even keep up with inflation\r\nMedical benefits with huge deductibles\r\nEverything possible is outsourced to the lowest bidder.

This causes a lack of space for the design employees, so often times six people are squeezed into a four cube area. \r\nAttrition seems to be getting worse and the quality of new employees is not as good as in the past.  I believe lack of talent is driven by a desire to rapidly grow so a strategy of quantity over quality was employed.
