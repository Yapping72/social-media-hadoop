Whether something has been done properly or not does not matter to them. Whether their employees are happy or not does not matter to them.  They take credit off of your every accomplishment as if they have anything to do with it, but when something goes wrong, they will burn you at the stake. They just want to get promoted and have big fat raises to their salaries.  \r\n\r\n3- When upper management make mistakes, workers, and engineers pay the price! As an engineer, my job is to build the engine as good as I can. As a manager your job is to find a customer for this engine.  IF as a manager you can not find a customer, THEN it is your fault. Please resign your position to someone more competent.  But nooooo ... those who are at the bottom of the packing order pay the price of the poor management. \r\n\r\n4-It is a good company if you want to get a job straight out of college with bachelors degree. If you have a masters or phd, DO NOT even bother, your education or experience will not be valued at all ... you will take orders from someone who does not even know the science behind how things work inside the engine just because that person has been in the company more than you do. \r\n\r\n5- There is too much bureaucracy!  in order to get one simple task done, you have to fight with numerous people.  \r\n\r\n6- If you are planning to come here to work, you'd better be good at kissing a lot of a$$, agreeing with everything that your seniors tell you, or you will not get any raise/promotion any time soon.\r\n\r\n7- The company is located in a VERY conservative area, and most of the employees are also very conservative and biased towards those come to the company outside the south (especially north east or the west). \r\n\r\n8 - Check the stock values, since 2008 stock values of GE's competitors went back to their original value. Yet, GE is still half price.  Obviously something is not going right.  Instead of replacing those who put the company at it's current position, they are laying people off ... sure!!! lay people off ... then waste money and hire clueless new graduates ... train them ... waste money ... then lay them off to cover your mistakes ...  :)  \r\n\r\n9- benefits?  what is that mean?  you will get the cheapest health insurance out there ... you will have to work on national holidays ... you will get the worst retirement benefits too ... GE cuts from its employees, so it can offer a sweet retirement to upper management ... i.e. check John Krenicki's retirement deal ... what did he do to deserve such a sweet deal?  Did he invent the gas turbine? \r\n\r\n10- The corporation made $14 billion dollar profit last year, but did not pay taxes ... what is the deal? why? I pay my taxes ... \r\n\r\n11-I finally had enough and applied for positions in GE's competitors. Currently I work for a competitor in Jupiter Florida, and get paid $15K more  :)  I have better health and retirement benefits.  I am not sure how many employees have to leave GE for upper management to realize that they have to treat their employees with a little more respect. \r\n\r\nIn the end we work for you! you do not own us!"}, {"review_title": "Lean & Loaded", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Oct 2012", "job_title": "Supply Chain in Peterborough, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "GE has some of the most tallented and knowledgable individuals I've ever had the experience to work with.

These changes are always announced with happy talk and pitched as improvements, in the form of easy to read elevator speeches that seem obviously written by a PR company.\r\n\r\nRather than call it what it is - when something is taken from you, it is a reduction in services, quality, benefits, and value.  So why can't they just stop sugar coating everything and acting like we are stupid.  \r\n\r\nIn the past week, GE and Electrolux jointly announced that GE was in talks with Electrolux to purchase our beloved appliance division, lock stock and barrel with Appliance Park Kentucky.   Even that announcement was written to dance around the truth, the announcement claimed that nothing was certain and the two companies were only involved in casual discussions, when the opposite is true.  \r\n\r\nSo now all the cost cutting and happy talk of the past few years makes sense:  we've been running on bubble gum and rubber bands to lower expenses so GE Appliances would be worth more.  With that spin removed, any fifth grader can see the truth of this situation:  what will happens next is that our loyal workers, most with more than a decade of service, will get flushed into an uncertain and dismal future just so that stockholders, who own stock in GE but not in the GE Appliance division, can make a few bucks while all this is going down and GE is continuing to apply \"MADE IN AMERICA\"  logos to all the appliances rolling out of Appliance Park, Kentucky.  \r\n\r\nThis division of  GE is the company that Thomas Edison formed in 1890, and Jeff Immelt is selling it to a company from Sweden that makes low quality appliances with bad service records.  They want to buy GE Appliances to fix their own problems.  But it never works like that, ask yourself where Maytag is after it was purchased by Whirlpool.  They still make a few Maytag appliances, but it is a shadow of what it used to be.  \r\n\r\nMy advice to job seekers:  Unless you are coming for a few months for an internship, I think you'd be crazy to come here now.

Everyone knows that GE was developed by inventor Thomas Edison, and was the first organization to manufacture the light bulb, and so on blah, blah, blah. However, what a prospective employee will want to know is the inside view of GE, i.e., what it is like to work in the organisation. As a current employee of GE, I hope to provide you with this insight. In the first paragraph, I will describe the outside view of GE, for those of you few people who are hearing about GE for the first time, so that you can get a general picture of the organization you are looking at. Then in subsequent paragraphs, I will give you the insider's view of GE, based on my own experiences, experiences of friends and colleagues, and the corporate grapevine.   \r\nThe General Electric Company, or GE, is an American multinational conglomerate corporation incorporated in the State of New York. In 2010, Forbes magazine had ranked GE as the world's second largest company, based on some kind of  formula that compared the total sales, profits, assets, and market value of several multinational companies. GE has 304,000 employees around the world and is definitely is one of the most giant companies in the world and a force to be reckoned with.\r\nOkay, now here is the viewpoint from the employee's point of view. The good things are the  flexible work timings, weekends off, subsidized food, free evening snacks, 20 days available leave (including sick leave), and availability of some good technical talent.\r\nSince everybody who has purchased a light bulb has heard about GE, it is also something which will be noticed on your resume. Also it follows six sigma quality standards and so you will be exposed to the most stringent quality practices. Reasonable good training is offered (of course your manager has to be proactive about recommending you for it) on both technical and quality issues. Good exposure to practices in a giant engineering company.\r\nOkay, though I am running out of time, I know that prospective employees will also want to know what are the cons, so I will give a brief description of that as well in the next section.", "cons": "Well, I am really running out of time, but I will definitely not abandon the reader and will touch upon the main important points which a prospective employee will have to keep in mind and be alert about.\r\nI have observed a poor quality of the HR and the middle level managers as compared to the presence of some good technical talent, as a consequence there is not much respect for  the technical talent, which has resulted in the technical talent being treated more as labour, rather than as talent. If you are a technical talent, you will have to conciliate with some of the arrogant and negligent behavior of HR and middle level managers, the only other alternative being to leave the organization. I have observed over the past year a very sizable attrition of the best technical 'icons' in the organization.\r\nThough the reasons why people leave the organization is never publicized and not known except to a few close friends, there is also a very good indication of some hire and fire practices being in place, it is quite well known from the grapevine that a sizable percentage of people leave the organization on performance grounds, apart from these, people can also be asked to leave based on suspicion of their commitment to the company(i.e., suspicion that they are looking for other jobs), people can also be asked to leave if it is believed that they are too well qualified and hence difficult to retain, hence not likely to become a long term asset. As a result of these factors, I would say that overall the job security is not very secure in this organization, especially when you compare it  with other Indian organizations. Well, these are the things you have to look out for, if you are trying to decide on joining or are considering joining the organization.\r\nWell,  I hope that I have been of help in this article, and I do hope that you are able to weigh the pros and cons and make a good decision.

Also give them an option to rate ALL of them as EQUALLY IMPORTANT.\r\n\r\nNow lets make a charitable David vs Goliath bet.  Me v.s. Glassdoor.  $5000 donated to the charity of choice. I will wager that over 94% will select the option that All of them are equally important.  It does not matter how many employees actually rate them. My wager? Less than 6% will reply back that the values listed are important but are NOT the GE CORE Values that are critical to the growth and success of General Electric\r\n\r\nThe real GE Values which truly ARE critical when INDIVIDUAL Goals and Objectives are identified in a one one one meeting with a manger. They are the following:\r\nExternal focus\r\nShow imagination and courage\r\nDrive inclusiveness, \r\nHave expertise \r\nClear thinkers\r\n\r\nMost teams are virtual, in silos, have no idea what related teams are doing. The teams that were outsourced work in sweat shop environments. They are treated as lepers, beaten with a stick, not embraced as teammates. In my last months at GE, after engaging HR and the Ombudsperson because my boss was a bully, a former Army vet who treated employees as if they were in the Army at boot camp, not part of a team. Sticking up for the team who STRONGLY advised me NOT to go to HR as it is the kiss of death and told me flat out they would plead the fifth if approached. They all advised me to shut up, collect the paycheck, pay the bills, and be grateful I have a job.  I couldn't do that. I dreaded going to work each day. I was depressed..desperately searched for another job at GE and FOUND a perfect fit.\r\nBut it was AFTER I went to HR. I was not allowed to move. I was put on a performance plan.\r\nWhen I was informed by my boss that I was being put on a performance plan (even though I achieved ALL my Goals and Objectives along with additional stretch goals) I explained that I needed a change after working for 4 years on a team that was constantly in flux, no stability, four managers in four years...my manager informed me that I COULD interview for the position, saw no reason why I couldn't move but he wanted to discuss it with HR first. End result, I was NOT allowed to interview..was put on a plan. \r\n\r\nThe rest is history. I could literally write a book about Corporate IT. It would be incredibly entertaining. Solidly backup my claims with data. The scandal stories alone would make it a best seller.  I decided not too because I am grateful for the fantastic managers I had in my early years. Grateful for the wide skill set I developed in those early years. And my last 4 or 5 years? I was schooled with 500+ examples of how NOT to lead, manage projects, treat people."}], [{"review_title": "Big Business", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Apr 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This company is well respected, with a wonderful history.

This in itself isn't a con - businesses have cycles, industry waxes and wanes, and along the way there will be hirings and firings, business class and coach, fat raises and thin. We all understand this, and I don't begrudge the company letting people go of people to make ends meet. We all make cutbacks in our lives when times are hard, the government should do it, and corporations -have- to do it.  I don't even begrudge the board the executive bonus increases and decreases that are tied to the 2017 and 2018 1B savings targets -- targets that big have to be driven from the top down, hard decisions need to be made, and if the right decisions are made intelligently, they've earned their bonuses.  In fact, were I in Jeff Immelt's shoes with an activist investor breathing down my neck demanding my job, I'd make many of the same moves he's making. So why the 1 star review, when I love the company, understand the cuts, and agree that we need to get back to positive cashflow?\r\n\r\nThe cut the already miserly 'above and beyond' bonus program. While this in itself isn't a big deal, it signals to me that the management layers have given up on morale, engagement, and everything that goes with it. The bang-for-buck of employee activities like affinity groups (which have also had their funding cut), holiday parties, and 'thank-you' bonus programs is unmatched, and to see these things go means that not only have they made cuts with heavy hearts, they've moved to a point where they just don't care about morale among the rank-and-file anymore. For this reason, I can only recommend that you stay away until better times return."}, {"review_title": "Best and worst of times", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "29 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Senior Project Manager in Charlottesville, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Diverse experiences ranging from accounting to operations and sales.
