I resigned due to personal reasons to do what was best for my family. During my interview for UR I was hired as a Tech 2 due to my experience and impressive resume background. The entire probation period I was set up to only service and repair tech 1 level equipment. I was also not put on the list to attend any of the equipment course classes that went on during my employment there. 3days before my probation ended I was terminated from UR because I did not agree to be demoted to a entry level technician. Now that I think about it I truly believe I was set up for failure from the day I was started with the company. Yet I still believe that UR is a great company to work for , but the leadership in the K25 branch needs to start leading by example DK. Don't treat veterans different due to their service connected injuries. What's right is right and what's wrong is wrong.
