They generally came from the ground up, and understood what it took to run a branch, while also working with people through any difficulties or changes.

Keep in mind, this micro-management was NOT coming branch level managers, but from upper management aka district level management. It took every bit of fun out of the job.\r\n\r\nPay is also a huge issue. The raises are miniscule, are definitely not consistent with inflation, and they will flatly hire someone on with less skill than you and pay them 2.50 more. I know this, because it happened to me. It's a part of what led me to my new job.\r\n\r\nThat leads into the long days. I know for some M-F, 7-5 is not bad, but it's not for me.

You are receiving incoming calls all day from customers that are either personal renters or companies, and they could be anywhere in the US or Canada. The training given does not prepare you for the calls you will get. Also, there is no consistent coaching and training to improve throughout your time there. They wait until you are doing poorly and then want to help. All branches have full autonomy whereas we have strict guidelines and processes that we have to follow. Also, the center has to work all major holidays but you are given more time that you can use to take off, but than that counts against you because if you don\u2019t reach your sales goals it\u2019s all on you.

Workloads for employees were triple what they should be, often times doing the work of two or more departments.  \r\n\r\nUpper management politics and poor HR staff only make matters worse. Stress is not properly managed. Employees quit or have a meltdown with no management or HR assistance . I watched the most excellent and talented co-workers, managers and outside sales staff leave the company due to stress or politics.  I myself requested a work from home option due to a new disability.  Not 'doable' even though by law you are allowed reasonable accommodation.  After 13 years of working my rear end off 55 hours a week they could not accommodate me for a few months.  My position would not have caused undue hardship working from home completing data entry one day per week.  I was told to take FMLA one day per week.  As usual, office politics made that situation go away.  I too, a hard working and loyal employee felt I had no choice but to leave. \r\n\r\nManagement styles are very inconsistent.  Growth opportunities are for outside sales and upper management with degrees and clout only. Branch level jobs are dead ends. Empty promises. \r\n\r\nMy advice? Don't ever get very sick or too stressed.

My district manager at the time of my employment with United Rentals was a very callous bully.  Though I interacted with him very little, relatively speaking, his influence was pervasive and created an incredibly disspiriting atmosphere, not just within my location, but also within the region.  Before one interprets this as a single person issue, the head of marketing for the company displayed much of the same behavioral overtones.  For example, more than once they came to my location and demanded off-the-cuff responses from our manager and sales staff in meetings with the entire branch in attendance (welder, yard men, mechanic, counter staff) to questions of internal financial roll up figures and competitors' daily inventory status that would require, at minimum, research and/or referencing reports.  Mine was one of the better producing locations within the region and yet was still, in effect, gripped by fear.  Additionally, the same could be said for all but one of the other district managers -- though much of my evidence for this is hearsay.  I cannot simply write this off to United Rentals being a good ol' boys club, though there are a lot of those traits.  I simply think that some companies are poorly run while others are well run.  And, heck, maybe I just had a bad experience?!  The biggest and best insight, in retrospect, that I received prior to accepting the offer from United Rentals is that one's success and quality of life with the company is largely dependent upon one's direct manager.  Unfortunately, the managers across the board appear to be negatively motivated and they do not appear to be selected based upon their virtuosity by any means.  While I am thankful for the opportunity that I was given to work for United Rentals, I am also very glad I moved on.  I have never worked for a company that I ended up feeling so empty about in the final analysis in terms of the climate, direction, purpose, etc."}, {"review_title": "If you want a challenging career while working with a high powered management team, come to UR.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "20 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Corporate Director in Stamford, CT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You can make an impact.
