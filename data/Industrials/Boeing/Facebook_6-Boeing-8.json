My girlfriend told me not to do this especially when I told her that they were 85 people short, her exact words were: there must be a reason for such a high turn over. So I leave from final Assembly and go right over there to mid-body.

They started confronting me with total nonsense blaming nicked wires on me, I one manager falsify my performance review who I did not even work for. I went to HR and reported it and it took them 8 months to fix ix and the next day I was terminated. The thing about it is that you would ask yourself what kind of company lets a manager falsify a performance review on an employee and nothing is done to that manager. This management system is do-do~! Simply because in this digital age something like that stays with you forever and for them to allow this to happen is crazy, and you go to HR and nothing is done at all. I have studied all kinds of corporate structure from the traditional pyramids to the team concept and I have over 20 years in the military and have been to all types of leadership schools. Boeing is putting these managers in these positions not because they are qualified but only because they can be controlled because they already know that they were put their as a favor. Now as an Advanced Network guy you kinda of know why they had problems with me even though I volunteered to help them. I was over qualified when I accepted the $16.34 as a direct hire and when I volunteered to help them those bums knew that I was way more qualified than then even though I had no previous experience. so they attacked me by falsifying my performance review.

Management does not appear to communicate.\r\n- The culture is one of defeatism, inaction, politicism, and avoidance of work. A huge company may move slower than a smaller one, but can still move a lot faster if employees are brought on board and engaged with the change. The \"ship\" will turn a lot faster if all hands are working to move it together.\r\n- Internal communication at Boeing is horrendous. Expect correspondence with management to be ignored and forgotten for weeks or even months. Boeing lacks all sense of urgency.\r\n- Management tends to cycle through roles they don't understand for \"development\" purposes, ruining any gains that might be gained by having managers experienced in the tasks they manage.\r\n- Excessive focus on management to metrics rather than doing what is best for the company. Management will refuse to do work needing to be done simply because doing it will harm their bonus.\r\n- The company is operating in the past and has failed to invest in a modern capital infrastructure. There is no ERP system, and Boeing is the only defense firm out of the top 25 which doesn't have one yet. Management of the company is done by spreadsheet and PowerPoint.\r\n- If you don't engage in politics and are not a woman, advancing to management is unlikely.\r\n- Human Resources policies are backwards and outdated. Time in position is heavily focused on for promotions. High performance is not compensated. Conformity to HR policy results in the poorest performers becoming managers, and the highest performers leaving the company for better prospects.\r\n- Supplier Management, particularly the management of Supplier Management, is known to be extremely poor across the entire company.

Boeing has been know for its pension and generous benefits.\r\nAlthough these benefits have vanished for new comers, those who have a pension and 2 or more decades at Boeing have a lot to lose especially when the cost cutting trend is now in full swing. Hanging on until eligibility is rather a complex game; trickier at the top than at the bottom. Employee surveys for instance\r\ncan really affect a manager's retirement. Employee surveys measure engagement. Gallup studies have shown a strong correlation between Engagement an future earnings. A low employee engagement, meaning a low participation in the employee survey affect stock option and stock related bonuses: the type of bonus once get at the director and executive levels. Affect their bonuses and it trickles down to the managers. So what should Managers who have a pension to lose do? Be the advocate of their subordinates and risk losing their pension? That would go against human nature. Cowering is the logical answer as Chairman Jim McNerney pointed out right after an earning call with investors. The time could not have been more appropriate. The more benefits waiting their maturity date the more cowering. A negative feedback loop reinforced from the Chairman down to the hourly employee. Looking at demographics, the average age at Boeing is right around 46. Although a significant percentage of Boeing employees are now eligible to retire (first wave of baby boomers), most are not there yet, but close. During a cost cutting trend, one can only imagine how excruciating the wait might be for those directors and managers. cowering is a predictable consequence. cowering and fearing nurture discontent. fuel the fire with unions, and incidentally fuel the employee survey. Although the survey might show a high percentage of discontentment, the mere participation in an employee survey helps raise the engagement percentage up which in turns helps directors and executives stock option and retirement bonuses--cowering feeds the top layers. Based on baby boomer pension benefits and  retirement waves still to come, the cowering at Boeing is bound to last another decade at least.

They have persevered through tremendously difficult working conditions.", "cons": "The company is filled with fine, hardworking people being strangled by the incompetence and greed of those at the top. The priority is to cut costs and you will be working to eliminate other people's jobs until your turn comes, too.\r\n   If you have a PhD, you can watch your career slowly erode the longer you stay here. This company does not value research done in-house. Instead, they believe all useful research comes from universities, which they fund, or small companies, which they buy and engulf.\r\n   Your creative ideas will languish if they do not fit into the current corporate vertical silos. There is constant shuffling above you, which is inevitable as there are so many layers. The managers you know are all good people and very personable. The ones you only see on webcasts are the ones eliminating jobs even when the company is raking in record profits. They say they are doing it for the good of the company. Sorry, if you are not on board.\r\n   Young people are encouraged to join to use the ping pong tables. Higher-paid personnel are encouraged to leave by periodically shuffling jobs and reducing funding.\r\n   Before you find the exit door, either walking out or being pushed from behind, you can slowly strangle in a maze of red tape. You will spend somewhere between 20 and 40% of your time looking for funds and complying with an ever increasing mountain of rules. You cannot charge the time to overhead as you can only charge about 1 hour per week to that. Nor to a project. In short, there are a plethora of unfunded mandates you must comply with.\r\n   Some examples may help. Do you want to buy a book or some utility software for a project? No problem. Just fill out a form for the book, make sure the library does not have it, get someone else to sign, then wait a few weeks. For the software, fill out a NSJ (non-standard software justification) and wait several weeks for Purchasing to buy it for you. What, you need it now? Well, you can always buy it yourself, as many employees do. Oh, you charged it to your travel card, instead of finding someone with a P-card (purchase card)? No problem, just fill out this LOD (letter of deviation, you deviant), and get signatures of your manager, their manager, and their manager's manager. You'll soon learn all the key acronyms and PROs (procedures). Sorry, little time for technical work. I told you that's what universities and small companies are for. Your job is to take their work and apply it when you have time and funding. \r\n   The place is a maddening mixture of insanity that would make Franz Kafka, Joseph Heller, and George Orwell proud. 'Repositioning' and 'geographic diversity' really mean laying off higher paid (older) workers and expecting employees to reapply for their same jobs with less money in less desirable locations such as Alabama. Welcome to the land of Dilbert.\r\n   You will constantly be experiencing friction in getting your work done by interference from upper management. If you want to write a paper or give a presentation outside the company, you need to submit your paper 6 weeks in advance. Then another 6 weeks to make the changes for camera ready copy, which must normally be returned within 2 or 3 weeks if your paper is to be published.\r\n   Upper management is amazingly busy. Busy reorganizing the company, deciding where to place you, inventing new names for new sub-organizations, cost-cutting, embracing the latest management fads, absorbing small companies, devising new metrics to 'flow down' to 'scorecards' on which your 'PE' (performance evaluation) will ultimately depend. The cost-cutting involves such matters as eliminating unused phone lines, replacing employee functions with new websites (each so badly designed that you need a 'ten-minute trainer' when you just want to get something done and don't have time for the nonsense). And always, always, adding new rules and regulations rather than eliminating red tape or upper management interference.\r\n   Another metaphor may help. Your relationship with upper management takes on characteristics of an abusive relationship. They tell you what to do. They do not listen to you, while pretending they do. They will try to convince you that everything is going well, they are interested in research, they value technical staff, and that we all share in the profits of the company. But, the truth is that things are going well for them; things get worse every year for the technical staff; upper management only wants applications of outsiders' research; and upper management can have raises of 15% or so, while yours will be below the cost of living even if you are rated 'effective.' A stacked ranking system is used, so most employees fall in the middle of the bell curve, and receive ratings of 'effective.' Upper management will gaslight you, saying their actions (e.g., 'repositioning' and 'geographic diversity') encourage diversity, while their intentions are just the opposite (bust unions and save money by getting rid of more expensive, older workers). In the beginning, you will hope your perceptions are wrong, and they will encourage you in that belief. Over time your self-confidence and self-perception will erode as management will deprive you of the resources you need to maintain your career (e.g., conference attendance, which is considered a 'perk' by upper management.) If you spend too much money on a project, you will be questioned. If you spend too little on a project, you will be questioned.\r\n   So how can you do long-term research? Well, the idea appears to be that you win CRAD contracts and the government pays for your research. Unfortunately, government agencies, oddly enough, seem to want to fund organizations with new exciting ideas and existing software already developed to at least a proof of concept stage. Most of the current ATFs (associate technical fellows) were around in the pre-merger days, when lower level managers had funds and the funds were easily available to investigate new ideas.\r\n   There is so much more that I only have time to touch on: ethics classes; the voice mail hell of TotalAccess; that management is secretly instructed not to tell you key info; upper management's financial micromanagement; the bean counters and MBAs in Chicago that will run your life, but you will never see. I could go on, but I think you get the idea.\r\n   In short, why would you want to come here? There used to be advantages to working for a large company: primarily job security, pension, and good benefits for which you were willing to put with a lot of bureaucracy. None of those reasons apply any more. So why would you want to work here if you could work for a small company?

Employees annual performance goals are more often than not extremely vague (purely qualitative instead of qualitative or tied to metrics) and therefore unattainable, which leaves your annual salary review mostly up to your manager's discretion. The culture lacks meritocracy. The workforce is (in general) miserable due to the perception of being overworked and underpaid. Complaining is rampant everywhere you go. Accountability is preached by executives, but not practiced in everyday running of business at the low levels of the company. In my experience many colleagues and coworkers fall behind on their tasks, play around on the internet, or in some cases don't do their job and it never seemed to be addressed by managers. Boeing denies many of its future business leaders opportunities for training and development. The company offers courses and certificate programs in Project Management, Six Sigma, and other Lean manufacturing concepts; but non-union management cites budgetary/time constraints, or non-applicability to job function if you step up and try to go after those certificates.

Boeing corporate and after that IAMW 751 union reps.  The Boeing corporate portion paints a rosey picture of how great the Boeing culture is and you get a warm fuzzy all over.  Then the union comes in and pretty much deflates everything and paints a very dark picture of Boeing.  That is after you are forced into a Union.  Yes folks, being part of a union is MANDATORY.  They are quick about taking your money as well.  \n\nNext, off to training.  Not job specific.  It's three days of learning how to set up an email account, choose benefits, go over Boeing / I AM joint programs, Web based training on safety, ethics compliance and such.  \n\nOn to my assigned work location.  I reported to be assigned plant and met my manager and safety focal.  A tour of the facilities was next.  Lots and lots of old, and I mean OLD milling machines.  As old as the people that work there that are retiring in masses.  \n\nMy first real day followed and I started to see what Boeing is.  The last union contract negotiated had a lot of take aways, the biggest one being the replacement of the famed Boeing pension witha 401k.  This has the majority of the people there very mad and bitter.  You can cut the negativity in the air with a knife which makes new comers like me uncomfortable to say the least.  \n\nThen there is an acceptance issue.  These guys have been there so long that there is a hierarchy, a pecking order, if you will, where new comers are made to feel left out and unwelcome.  This falls in hand with the next con.  \n\nOJT.  If you are an outsider with no experience with milling machines or CNC (computer numerical control) systems....God help you.  I've tried to be in on the trouble calls, troubleshooting and just trying to learn the basics of this new job.  I was left with having to look over people's shoulders trying to get a feel for what is happening and try to ask questions only to get bumped out of the way and grunted at when trying to ask questions.  After a few weeks of this type of behavior and just observing, one of the senior guys had the audacity to tell me I needed to get into the habit of asking questions.  My reply was \"My only question is, what is going on?  It's hard to ask questions after getting snubbed so many times by so many people, including you!\"  He got mad and walked away.  Strike 1 for me for wanting to learn.\n\nLater on, I overheard several conversations of how the best revenge against Boeing and the Union for the contract take aways was to not train the new hires and retire before the pension goes away.  \n\nTry showing some initiative?  Well, the first time I did that on a trouble call, I got a talking to by a senior tech about my place in the shop. I was made to feel like I was stepping on his toes when I was feeling desperate to make a contribution to something...anything.  So much for trying.  No recourse because in a union, seniority rules the roost and I'm at the bottom of the chip pile.  Strike 2 for me for wanting to contribute.  \n\nSafety is a running joke here.  The machines are so old and in dire need of safety retrofits but the cost would be too great.  Need to secure power to a motor?  Pull the 408 VAC fuses with the power still on.  \nThere is lock out, tag, try out training that is mandatory for technicians and mechanics but it is very generic.  If you don't know how to work on a tool safely due to lack of training and are thrown at something because you are a warm body, the training is pointless.  \n\nI'm already looking for a new job.  The negativity is suffocating to the point where I wake up every day dry heaving and fretting about going to work.   There will be no strike 3 for me.  \n\nMaybe it's a union thing.

Some locations/shops may not be as bad but where I was at (Everett, Wa), it was horrible. \r\n\r\nJust a few things employees face; \r\n\r\nYou can't stop to tie a shoe without being harassed on why you aren't working. I witnessed them following people around and harassing them almost non stop even while people worked. \r\n\r\nThey move people to new planes and new areas without allowing them time to learn the job and regardless of how many people may have an issue with a particular job it's always the employees fault, never the company or how the job was created, the anomoly of the structure itself, etc.  \r\n\r\nThey won't help you to succeed because really if they don't like you, if you haven't kissed the right butt, if you haven't worked yourself to death, they're wanting you to fail.  Even if you do think, \"well, I'm a hardworker, I can do it!\" just know when you get hurt (and you will get hurt working like that there or develop health issues) there is NO LOYALTY once you are broken, they'll be gunning to get rid of you. \r\n\r\nThey clump people with disabilities together and ship them outside (on projects that don't even seem like a plane truly for sale, shutter to think the hours wasted therel!) and harass them until they quit or get fired. Anyone using FMLA is treated as though they are lazy or abusing the federal law and while some may do that, not all do.  Some just want to get their health together and get back to work.\r\n\r\nManagement and team leaders even promote the overall toxic atmosphere by openly speaking badly about employees and eachother so there's no real going to work, doing your job and going home. Day shift is worse for it as far as I can tell. \r\n\r\nIt's challenging to get into other positions there because it's a long process before you can even apply. It use to be that you could just put in a request but now they've instituted a litany of requirements before you even qualify to put in a move request so most people get stuck and when you're new to a shop, you can't move for a year anyway.  \r\n\r\nWith forced overtime there is no work/life balance. Depending on where you end up, that's a real possibility. You work to live, you dont live to work. \r\n\r\nThey have no values anymore. They go on and on about ethics  while they take entire groups of people with varying levels of disabilities or health issues and send them outside to an area even more unsafe than where they were coming from! \r\n\r\nThe company is merely an empty shell of what it once was and if they continue on this course, the pay just won't be worth the excessive health issues one is likely to develop while there, the stress it adds to your personal life..I would rather be paid less and treated with dignity.  \r\n\r\nYour life is a precious one.

I went to HR and reported it and it took them 8 months to fix ix and the next day I was terminated.

I was over qualified when I accepted the $16.34 as a direct hire and when I volunteered to help them those bums knew that I was way more qualified than then even though I had no previous experience. so they attacked me by falsifying my performance review.

I had 4 managers during my time at Boeing, and none were able to translate business objectives into measurable, obtainable goals for employees. This leads to chaos and confusion. This is made worse by the fact Boeing is so large, nobody knows what is going on elsewhere in the company. Entire functions and departments are replicated leading to massive amounts of waste. Management does not appear to communicate.\r\n- The culture is one of defeatism, inaction, politicism, and avoidance of work. A huge company may move slower than a smaller one, but can still move a lot faster if employees are brought on board and engaged with the change. The \"ship\" will turn a lot faster if all hands are working to move it together.\r\n- Internal communication at Boeing is horrendous. Expect correspondence with management to be ignored and forgotten for weeks or even months. Boeing lacks all sense of urgency.\r\n- Management tends to cycle through roles they don't understand for \"development\" purposes, ruining any gains that might be gained by having managers experienced in the tasks they manage.\r\n- Excessive focus on management to metrics rather than doing what is best for the company. Management will refuse to do work needing to be done simply because doing it will harm their bonus.\r\n- The company is operating in the past and has failed to invest in a modern capital infrastructure. There is no ERP system, and Boeing is the only defense firm out of the top 25 which doesn't have one yet. Management of the company is done by spreadsheet and PowerPoint.\r\n- If you don't engage in politics and are not a woman, advancing to management is unlikely.\r\n- Human Resources policies are backwards and outdated. Time in position is heavily focused on for promotions. High performance is not compensated. Conformity to HR policy results in the poorest performers becoming managers, and the highest performers leaving the company for better prospects.\r\n- Supplier Management, particularly the management of Supplier Management, is known to be extremely poor across the entire company.

Boeing has been know for its pension and generous benefits.\r\nAlthough these benefits have vanished for new comers, those who have a pension and 2 or more decades at Boeing have a lot to lose especially when the cost cutting trend is now in full swing. Hanging on until eligibility is rather a complex game; trickier at the top than at the bottom. Employee surveys for instance\r\ncan really affect a manager's retirement. Employee surveys measure engagement. Gallup studies have shown a strong correlation between Engagement an future earnings. A low employee engagement, meaning a low participation in the employee survey affect stock option and stock related bonuses: the type of bonus once get at the director and executive levels. Affect their bonuses and it trickles down to the managers. So what should Managers who have a pension to lose do? Be the advocate of their subordinates and risk losing their pension? That would go against human nature. Cowering is the logical answer as Chairman Jim McNerney pointed out right after an earning call with investors. The time could not have been more appropriate. The more benefits waiting their maturity date the more cowering. A negative feedback loop reinforced from the Chairman down to the hourly employee. Looking at demographics, the average age at Boeing is right around 46. Although a significant percentage of Boeing employees are now eligible to retire (first wave of baby boomers), most are not there yet, but close. During a cost cutting trend, one can only imagine how excruciating the wait might be for those directors and managers. cowering is a predictable consequence. cowering and fearing nurture discontent. fuel the fire with unions, and incidentally fuel the employee survey. Although the survey might show a high percentage of discontentment, the mere participation in an employee survey helps raise the engagement percentage up which in turns helps directors and executives stock option and retirement bonuses--cowering feeds the top layers. Based on baby boomer pension benefits and  retirement waves still to come, the cowering at Boeing is bound to last another decade at least.

They have persevered through tremendously difficult working conditions.", "cons": "The company is filled with fine, hardworking people being strangled by the incompetence and greed of those at the top. The priority is to cut costs and you will be working to eliminate other people's jobs until your turn comes, too.\r\n   If you have a PhD, you can watch your career slowly erode the longer you stay here. This company does not value research done in-house. Instead, they believe all useful research comes from universities, which they fund, or small companies, which they buy and engulf.\r\n   Your creative ideas will languish if they do not fit into the current corporate vertical silos. There is constant shuffling above you, which is inevitable as there are so many layers. The managers you know are all good people and very personable. The ones you only see on webcasts are the ones eliminating jobs even when the company is raking in record profits. They say they are doing it for the good of the company. Sorry, if you are not on board.\r\n   Young people are encouraged to join to use the ping pong tables. Higher-paid personnel are encouraged to leave by periodically shuffling jobs and reducing funding.\r\n   Before you find the exit door, either walking out or being pushed from behind, you can slowly strangle in a maze of red tape. You will spend somewhere between 20 and 40% of your time looking for funds and complying with an ever increasing mountain of rules. You cannot charge the time to overhead as you can only charge about 1 hour per week to that. Nor to a project. In short, there are a plethora of unfunded mandates you must comply with.\r\n   Some examples may help. Do you want to buy a book or some utility software for a project? No problem. Just fill out a form for the book, make sure the library does not have it, get someone else to sign, then wait a few weeks. For the software, fill out a NSJ (non-standard software justification) and wait several weeks for Purchasing to buy it for you. What, you need it now? Well, you can always buy it yourself, as many employees do. Oh, you charged it to your travel card, instead of finding someone with a P-card (purchase card)? No problem, just fill out this LOD (letter of deviation, you deviant), and get signatures of your manager, their manager, and their manager's manager. You'll soon learn all the key acronyms and PROs (procedures). Sorry, little time for technical work. I told you that's what universities and small companies are for. Your job is to take their work and apply it when you have time and funding. \r\n   The place is a maddening mixture of insanity that would make Franz Kafka, Joseph Heller, and George Orwell proud. 'Repositioning' and 'geographic diversity' really mean laying off higher paid (older) workers and expecting employees to reapply for their same jobs with less money in less desirable locations such as Alabama. Welcome to the land of Dilbert.\r\n   You will constantly be experiencing friction in getting your work done by interference from upper management. If you want to write a paper or give a presentation outside the company, you need to submit your paper 6 weeks in advance. Then another 6 weeks to make the changes for camera ready copy, which must normally be returned within 2 or 3 weeks if your paper is to be published.\r\n   Upper management is amazingly busy. Busy reorganizing the company, deciding where to place you, inventing new names for new sub-organizations, cost-cutting, embracing the latest management fads, absorbing small companies, devising new metrics to 'flow down' to 'scorecards' on which your 'PE' (performance evaluation) will ultimately depend. The cost-cutting involves such matters as eliminating unused phone lines, replacing employee functions with new websites (each so badly designed that you need a 'ten-minute trainer' when you just want to get something done and don't have time for the nonsense). And always, always, adding new rules and regulations rather than eliminating red tape or upper management interference.\r\n   Another metaphor may help. Your relationship with upper management takes on characteristics of an abusive relationship. They tell you what to do. They do not listen to you, while pretending they do. They will try to convince you that everything is going well, they are interested in research, they value technical staff, and that we all share in the profits of the company. But, the truth is that things are going well for them; things get worse every year for the technical staff; upper management only wants applications of outsiders' research; and upper management can have raises of 15% or so, while yours will be below the cost of living even if you are rated 'effective.' A stacked ranking system is used, so most employees fall in the middle of the bell curve, and receive ratings of 'effective.' Upper management will gaslight you, saying their actions (e.g., 'repositioning' and 'geographic diversity') encourage diversity, while their intentions are just the opposite (bust unions and save money by getting rid of more expensive, older workers). In the beginning, you will hope your perceptions are wrong, and they will encourage you in that belief. Over time your self-confidence and self-perception will erode as management will deprive you of the resources you need to maintain your career (e.g., conference attendance, which is considered a 'perk' by upper management.) If you spend too much money on a project, you will be questioned. If you spend too little on a project, you will be questioned.\r\n   So how can you do long-term research? Well, the idea appears to be that you win CRAD contracts and the government pays for your research. Unfortunately, government agencies, oddly enough, seem to want to fund organizations with new exciting ideas and existing software already developed to at least a proof of concept stage. Most of the current ATFs (associate technical fellows) were around in the pre-merger days, when lower level managers had funds and the funds were easily available to investigate new ideas.\r\n   There is so much more that I only have time to touch on: ethics classes; the voice mail hell of TotalAccess; that management is secretly instructed not to tell you key info; upper management's financial micromanagement; the bean counters and MBAs in Chicago that will run your life, but you will never see. I could go on, but I think you get the idea.\r\n   In short, why would you want to come here? There used to be advantages to working for a large company: primarily job security, pension, and good benefits for which you were willing to put with a lot of bureaucracy. None of those reasons apply any more. So why would you want to work here if you could work for a small company? You are just as likely to be laid off, you won't get a pension, and you won't be allowed to stay current with your skills.\r\n  It is a shame that a company that makes so many interesting products and has so much potential for interesting research has instead severely crippled its research capabilities, scientists, and engineers due to terribly misguided management."}, {"review_title": "I celebrated the day I left the IETM program", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Tech Writer in Fort Walton Beach, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent pay for the area, good benefits if you get hired on from being a contractor.

Non-Union employees have very little say in their salary negotiations. Employees annual performance goals are more often than not extremely vague (purely qualitative instead of qualitative or tied to metrics) and therefore unattainable, which leaves your annual salary review mostly up to your manager's discretion. The culture lacks meritocracy. The workforce is (in general) miserable due to the perception of being overworked and underpaid. Complaining is rampant everywhere you go. Accountability is preached by executives, but not practiced in everyday running of business at the low levels of the company. In my experience many colleagues and coworkers fall behind on their tasks, play around on the internet, or in some cases don't do their job and it never seemed to be addressed by managers. Boeing denies many of its future business leaders opportunities for training and development. The company offers courses and certificate programs in Project Management, Six Sigma, and other Lean manufacturing concepts; but non-union management cites budgetary/time constraints, or non-applicability to job function if you step up and try to go after those certificates. The policies and procedures on the defense side of Boeing are in constant flux; so it can be challenging to adhere to your internal controls. Lack of attention to detail was a huge contributor to waste. Rework generated by bad information, or inaccurate requirements was a huge part of my job.

Boeing corporate and after that IAMW 751 union reps.  The Boeing corporate portion paints a rosey picture of how great the Boeing culture is and you get a warm fuzzy all over.  Then the union comes in and pretty much deflates everything and paints a very dark picture of Boeing.  That is after you are forced into a Union.  Yes folks, being part of a union is MANDATORY.  They are quick about taking your money as well.  \n\nNext, off to training.  Not job specific.  It's three days of learning how to set up an email account, choose benefits, go over Boeing / I AM joint programs, Web based training on safety, ethics compliance and such.  \n\nOn to my assigned work location.  I reported to be assigned plant and met my manager and safety focal.  A tour of the facilities was next.  Lots and lots of old, and I mean OLD milling machines.  As old as the people that work there that are retiring in masses.  \n\nMy first real day followed and I started to see what Boeing is.  The last union contract negotiated had a lot of take aways, the biggest one being the replacement of the famed Boeing pension witha 401k.  This has the majority of the people there very mad and bitter.  You can cut the negativity in the air with a knife which makes new comers like me uncomfortable to say the least.  \n\nThen there is an acceptance issue.  These guys have been there so long that there is a hierarchy, a pecking order, if you will, where new comers are made to feel left out and unwelcome.  This falls in hand with the next con.  \n\nOJT.  If you are an outsider with no experience with milling machines or CNC (computer numerical control) systems....God help you.  I've tried to be in on the trouble calls, troubleshooting and just trying to learn the basics of this new job.  I was left with having to look over people's shoulders trying to get a feel for what is happening and try to ask questions only to get bumped out of the way and grunted at when trying to ask questions.  After a few weeks of this type of behavior and just observing, one of the senior guys had the audacity to tell me I needed to get into the habit of asking questions.  My reply was \"My only question is, what is going on?  It's hard to ask questions after getting snubbed so many times by so many people, including you!\"  He got mad and walked away.  Strike 1 for me for wanting to learn.\n\nLater on, I overheard several conversations of how the best revenge against Boeing and the Union for the contract take aways was to not train the new hires and retire before the pension goes away.  \n\nTry showing some initiative?  Well, the first time I did that on a trouble call, I got a talking to by a senior tech about my place in the shop. I was made to feel like I was stepping on his toes when I was feeling desperate to make a contribution to something...anything.  So much for trying.  No recourse because in a union, seniority rules the roost and I'm at the bottom of the chip pile.  Strike 2 for me for wanting to contribute.  \n\nSafety is a running joke here.  The machines are so old and in dire need of safety retrofits but the cost would be too great.  Need to secure power to a motor?  Pull the 408 VAC fuses with the power still on.  \nThere is lock out, tag, try out training that is mandatory for technicians and mechanics but it is very generic.  If you don't know how to work on a tool safely due to lack of training and are thrown at something because you are a warm body, the training is pointless.  \n\nI'm already looking for a new job.  The negativity is suffocating to the point where I wake up every day dry heaving and fretting about going to work.   There will be no strike 3 for me.  \n\nMaybe it's a union thing.  I just dont know.

Day shift is worse for it as far as I can tell. \r\n\r\nIt's challenging to get into other positions there because it's a long process before you can even apply. It use to be that you could just put in a request but now they've instituted a litany of requirements before you even qualify to put in a move request so most people get stuck and when you're new to a shop, you can't move for a year anyway.  \r\n\r\nWith forced overtime there is no work/life balance. Depending on where you end up, that's a real possibility. You work to live, you dont live to work. \r\n\r\nThey have no values anymore. They go on and on about ethics  while they take entire groups of people with varying levels of disabilities or health issues and send them outside to an area even more unsafe than where they were coming from! \r\n\r\nThe company is merely an empty shell of what it once was and if they continue on this course, the pay just won't be worth the excessive health issues one is likely to develop while there, the stress it adds to your personal life..I would rather be paid less and treated with dignity.  \r\n\r\nYour life is a precious one.
