If you are technical, then you will always be at risk of layoff. \r\n\r\nIT management is as clueless as it gets. Many of them have no IT backgrounds and can\u2019t seem to tell their behinds from their elbows. It\u2019s funny too how during layoff cycles none of the IT management was ever affected. \r\n\r\nThere is no room for new creative ideas which is very frustrating.

If you are technical, then you will always be at risk of layoff. \r\n\r\nIT management is as clueless as it gets. Many of them have no IT backgrounds and can\u2019t seem to tell their behinds from their elbows.
