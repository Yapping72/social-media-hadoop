It's as if the company is betting their entire future on what these new employees may be able to provide vs. what the current employees do provide. If you're in your 40's, or above, your future is pretty much set in stone. Reaching a technical level 4 is probably it. Level 5's and above, as well as older level 4's, are always at risk of being tossed out due to the salary they're being paid. The company is trying to migrate to an average technical level somewhere between 3 and 4. Once you move from reviews that 'exceed expectations' to ones that simply say 'met expectations', you know your time is limited.\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to move into management your future is wide open. Staying in a technical track will never keep pace w/ the management track when it comes to salary and bonuses. Bonuses on the management side are nearly double that of the technical side. Side note, if you are female and/or a member of some sort of defined minority class then more possibilities exist now and into the future. Problem the company has now IMO is people who probably shouldn't even work there are taking the management track and it's starting to show in the decisions being made. Managers are rarely if ever put on the street for poor decisions, but, simply moved to other areas 'more fitting'. \r\n\r\nRecent contract wins for military items have increased the number of technical opportunities present, but, you will work long hours with little to no overtime pay under a schedule that is not achievable. Your bonus will not make up for these long hours. Accolades will go to the management and exec levels at the expense of the technical levels. You will have to dial back your expectations of reality as well. Think you can get a project done in a year? No, better plan on three. And, it will be way over budget. All of these things will be out of your control. \r\n\r\nFor the most part your work will be judged on how well it looks in PowerPoint opposed to what actual contribution it has to the performance of the product or the bottom line. I've seen a number of technically bad ideas actually make it into a product. Some of the most basic of engineering concepts are lost on a number of both new, and, seasoned employees. Questioning these ideas will only bring shame upon yourself unless you're willing to really stand up to them and call them out for the junk science they are. Most are not willing to do this and simply keep quiet, or, leave the company. \r\n\r\nWork output expectations from new hires is typically low. In fact most expectations are low when it comes to new hires. Show up when you want, leave when you want, Don't want to work on something? That's OK, here's something more interesting. I'll have the seasoned engineers do your real work for you. \r\n\r\nAn 80% solution to a problem is OK because the company will just propose to fix the other 20% in the next contract proposal. Then do only 80% of that requirement. On and on and on....Now you know why a hammer costs the government a million dollars. Why fix a problem when there is more money to be made in prolonging the problem.\r\n\r\n2019 will be the first year where the company has a tiered plan when it comes to medical cost deductions. The less pay you make, the less you pay in medical premiums. Some will pay nothing this year. They say the executive level will pay the most but I seriously doubt that as there are typically employment contracts which dictate nearly all exec perks. For a number of years we had a no-cost HSA but the deductibles kept creeping up. This year we still have the high deductibles, but, there are monthly deductions now.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have children, 2019 and beyond is the year to do so. Three months of paid time off along w/ 12 weeks of FMLA as well as short and long term disability pay if you want to go that route. I would expect you could have a child, take 3 months off, work on making another and then in 9 months, take off again. Some people could do this a number of times and do little actual work all while getting full pay and bonuses. If you're spouse works there then these benefits apply to them as well. \r\n\r\nIf you make it 10 years at Boeing you will find it very difficult to move away from the company and expect to make something close to what you were making. They have really skewed the salaries in the area. The pay is above average for the area, especially considering the tasks that some do for the pay they make.

The performance management process at Boeing is broken, which is great for an average engineer, but terrible for the high performers.

Boeing is also going through cost reduction exercises with intentional reduction of advancements above grade 3.\r\n\r\nIn-line advancement beyond grade 3 is difficult and beyond grade 4 doesn't happen. For experienced staff, Boeing requires applying for a new position and these positions are often open to external candidates, so they are competitive.

It is no different to applying to another position at any other company, so there is little incentive to remain at Boeing if you find a better offer elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTools and methods in some disciplines, like structural analysis, lag behind those used in other industries.

Average raises are in the 3-4% range with \"good\" years in the 5-6% range. Save the company a billion dollars? Here's a 5% raise! After a while, you realize that the extra 1-2% isn't worth the hassle of working so hard....\r\n\r\nThe company demographics are horrible. There is almost nobody there aged 35-55 with 15-25 years experience. It's those with less than 10 years and those with over 25 years and that's it. As a new hire or mid-level engineer, you're basically waiting for a bunch of old, fat white guys with 30+ years in to retire or die before you can truly move up the ranks. Half of them hate working there and wax nostalgic about the good ol' days from 20+ years ago. \r\n\r\nThe negativity in the workforce ingrained over the last decade has become a cancer that has infiltrated the entire company. In their defense, much of this attitude has been a direct result of an adversarial and irrational relationship between top management and the engineers - care of the now (thankfully) former CEO. Maybe in another decade you might actually find people that enjoy working at this company again, but for now, morale is very low and people are frustrated with a company that is only a shell of what it used to be. Many of the older workers are on cruise-control, just waiting out the next 3-5 years before they can retire.\r\n\r\nWith the loss of pensions, the trend of job-hopping rather than staying at one company, and big software firms nearby paying big bucks, I can't imagine most new hires will last the 15-20 years necessary to become replacements for the experts that will soon be retiring. The company reminds me much of IBM circa 1995...\r\n\r\nBean counters run the company. Prepare to spend 1/3 of your time giving status, planning, and tracking once you hit mid-level. Despite all of that planning and tracking, things are still late and over budget. \"But *this* time we'll fix it all!\" This has driven the very same bean counters to demand more and more work be outsourced to outside companies. I have seen many unique, highly technical design jobs shipped out and never to return again. These are projects that get done once every decade or so. Sending it out even once means that the next time you want to do it internally, you'll be forced to re-invent the wheel since nobody will be around that remembers how to do it. I've even had the pleasure of major work being outsourced only to have that very same outsourcing company contact us directly and ask if we knew of another company that could do the work since they didn't actually know how but accepted the work anyway. This is the insanity that has become decision making at The Boeing Company.\r\n\r\nThe company is over-reliant on processes. Ordering a box of screws from an outside vendor takes four separate people to process and approve the order and another half dozen to receive and deliver it 2-3 weeks later - if it doesn't get lost somewhere inside the company beforehand. This is something that I could order myself with a credit card in 10 minutes and have at my door in a few days. They took away purchase cards from engineers many years ago because they thought they were too wasteful.  Starting to see the pattern yet?\r\n\r\nA laughably weak engineers union: Paid overtime (time plus $6.50, don't ask why) is great when you see folks in software working 60-70+ hours a week and getting paid for 40. However, the same union has made it difficult for management to fire the truly incompetent and/or lazy. Compound that over 40+ years and you end up with some truly stupid people being paid large sums of money to do nothing of actual value. The worst part is, many of these people don't even realize how truly screwed they would be if they had to find a job anywhere else. For instance: I have worked with \"engineers\" with over 20 years \"experience\" that could barely manage to produce work I would expect an intern to do and ask technical questions so basic that I wonder if they have serious memory problems.

It is awesome to be able to work in a place that has such a tangible effect on the world.  Boeing has a very generous tuition assistance program, I received my Masters degree for almost free from this program.  Compensation and benefits are good in my opinion.  Healthcare & 401k are great.  Pay scales are good for some jobs, annual raises are usually 2-3%, higher if in SPEEA.  The company is also doing a lot to get serious about competitors such as Airbus, start to focus on competition and efficiency.

Where engineering is not actual making decisions, senior leadership has a background in engineering.  This inst all bad, but it leads to an unbalanced culture.  Boeing is very much stuck in a seniority system.  Most personnel decision making (pay, assignments, promotions, etc.) is dominated by years of service requirements.  This creates a company where people either learn to \"do their time\" and lose their passion or they leave the company.  Many talented young people are coming to the company, getting frustrated with this culture and leaving.  Facilities/offices are generally pretty crappy and drab, and parking is a nightmare at the major sites.  There seems to be an expectation in the Puget Sound that regardless of where you live you will eventually have to commute to a different site, regardless of how much this may impact your life or family.  Despite this, senior management seems to be completely uninterested in investing in any kindof inter-site transportation, or even building enough parking spots for employees to reasonably get to work.  I have honestly spent over an hour, multiple times trying to find a place to park when coming to Renton site or Everett site mid-day for a meeting.

Boeing provides a pretty liberal vacation/sick policy compared to a lot of companies I've heard about. The retirement benefits are pretty decent despite the recent changes, however for new employees there is no longer a pension plan available which makes working here less worth it in my opinion. The same goes for the education programs. They used to be top-notch, but because of the recent changes they are as decent as many other companies within my field now.\r\n\r\nThey also changed their health care plans recently under the guise of \"even before the recession, we had a top-notch plan compared to our competitors\". Probably the biggest benefit of working here is that it's pretty stable. Even if a program gets slashed, they will find a new place for you. The St. Louis facility is mostly military projects, so it's all funded by government contracts.", "cons": "Boeing has all of the typical big company pitfalls, such as lack of communication across departments (especially across different sites within the country), lots and lots of red tape and bureaucracy, too many middle management positions that need to be slashed but never will, so much overhead that you find yourself spending at least a good hour or two a day dealing with overhead BS at your job (whether it's useless training courses, etc.). This place is very baby-boomer heavy as other posters have mentioned. They are a few years away from retirement.\r\n\r\nBoeing is very good at making up its own terms and its own initiatives and never following industry trends for software engineering for example. Lots of processes need serious revamping. This company has an extremely change-resistant culture. People are very used to doing things the same way they did 20+ years ago and would rather never change it despite today's rapidly dynamic economy. Over the years, I have seen many people attempt to introduce recent industry trends into the particular group. It's all started but then dies out after a few months. Depending on where you work in the St. Louis facility, many of the facilities are just awful. You don't even have your own cube unless you're a manager. The area Boeing is at in St. Louis is just slummy and depressing. There are a ton of people in this place that shouldn't have a job here. As said before, too many middle management positions and there also tons of people who spend the majority of  their time on the Internet during work here."}, {"review_title": "Good place to start a career", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Oct 2011", "job_title": "Systems Engineer in El Segundo, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Long history of a company, solid engineering processes", "cons": "Limited job growth potential.

You can rely on working the minimum 40 hours a week.  If you go over, you can flex it, and no one will think any less of you - unless there's an impacting customer issue, of course.  For younger hires, going to school while working at Boeing is pretty easy if you don't have a family.  Boeing has a decent education reimbursement program to facilitate this.  \r\n+ Good Total Compensation:  Many people complain that they aren't compensated well at Boeing.  It's true they do not pay top salary for most job positions, however, they make it up in a comprehensive benefits package as well as a lot of off-time in the form of holiday, sick leave, AND vacation time.  Salaried even gets over time.  Also, union positions are in no position to complain about their salary.  \r\n+ A Position for Everyone:  Boeing hires everything from aerospace engineers and accountants to firefighters and weathermen.  If you want to do a career change, you don't have to leave the company to do it.\r\n+ Job Security:  You have to actively try to get fired.  It's really obscene.  I never saw someone get fired for poor job performance.  You can only get fired if you do something really blatant like steal from the company, start a fight, bring a gun, intimidate someone - basically anything that can cause legal trouble for Boeing if they don't fire you.  Boeing makes a lot of headlines when they do layoffs, but quite frankly, I didn't know anyone who got laid off who didn't see it coming.  Boeing keeps programs going well after the point that they should have been killed off.", "cons": "+ Slow Pace:  Boeing, along with the rest of the airline industry, is obsessed with safety.  As a result, the pace of innovation is very slow.  Few people in the company get to really push boundaries and make a dent in the universe.  Those that do have to stay with the company for years - it takes a long time to make/change an aircraft design.  \r\n+ Lazy Culture:  Because of the obscenely high amount of job security, good compensation, and slow pace, the large portion of the population is complacent.  Those who want to change the world and make a difference leave, leaving a bunch of B level performers.  New \"As\" either turn back around and leave, or they themselves become complacent, having no reason to try hard.  Even the best aerospace engineers typically leave and come back as a consultant, getting paid even more than what Boeing already offers the engineering union.  \r\n+ Ageism:  There's a huge age gap in the company in all areas.  This often manifests itself in impatient \"kids\" wanting to do something new, but are actively discouraged or ignored by the \"old timers\" who think they know the right way to do everything.  Promotions are only partially merit based, and much of it requires a certain number of years at a certain level as per the \"process\".  There are many 1st level managers who go their position solely because they've been at the company for decades with no excuse to let them go.  \r\n\r\nOverall, I recommend Boeing for those who prioritize a stable job and good work life balance over anything else - it's a good family job.  Also, engineers (those that can get a SPEEA union job) should go into Boeing.  No brainer.  The compensation and job security are stupidly high for SPEEA.  \r\n\r\nFor those ambitious with their career, look elsewhere, because Boeing will make you dumb and lazy if you're not careful."}, {"review_title": "Relaxed work environment, but no job security.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "24 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Renton, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not as high pressured as some other companies.

Because Boeing does so many different things (aircraft production, advanced avionics, large scale system integration, advanced weapon systems, satellites, UAVs, etc.) it's easy to get a broad range of experience just by moving around the company. Boeing is also very good about work life balance. In most instances, the 40 hour week is the norm and OT is on a voluntary basis. Also, at Boeing, you get paid for every hour you work. Even though exempt employees are on salery, all overtime is paid at your normal rate +$6.50/hour.

This is typical at big companies, but it is systemic at Boeing, infecting every level. There is little chance of Boeing ever changing as they have started \"training\" every manager at what they call \"The Leadership Center\" but the managers call it \"The Plush Prison\". It was described to me by a manager as a very slick version of a communist reeducation camp. From sunup to sundown for a week managers are subjected to intense \"training\".

Senior Management tend to reward like thinking and overlook those who question the status quo....even when those questions are professional, appropriate, and highly thoughtful.  \r\n\r\nThe Boeing legacy is rich in developmental history, technology, and foresight, however, the current environment does not even recognize the value of contributions from acquired organizations (e.g. Hughes, North American, Rocketdyne, etc.).  In truth, there is still exists quite a bit of the Boeing vs. Mac Dac/Hughes/etc. mentality.  Additionally, the management emphasis is on cultural diversity, but it is defined in gender and ethnic terms and not by experience or professional background.  There are other aerospace organizations that place a higher value on diversity of experience than Boeing.  And that will ultimately be Boeing's downfall.  \r\n\r\nFew if the senior managers ever get out and spend any time with the employees.  They tend to be isolated and removed from day-to-day issues, pressures, problems and opportunities.

There's a lot of interesting projects to work on, and some really cool technology to work with.  One nice thing about Boeing is the ability to cross over into different careers and get exposure to the rest of the company.  You can also work in many different cities which is a nice flexibility.  The work history behind most long time Boeing employees is very impressive and interesting due the large amount of technical diversity in the company.  \r\n\r\nMost engineers at Boeing can basically work how the want and dress any way they want.

However, if you bust your butt and work really hard, you'll manage to get a 4.5% raise.  I swear I've seen many people sleeping at their desk at work.\r\n\r\n4)  The most irritating thing about Boeing Management is how they are decades behind current industry standards and modern concepts.  It's definitely an old-man's company.  Most of the engineers you see are gray, balding, and pushing retirement.  There's not enough young blood to come in and take over the domain knowledge of the business.  As such, there's a complete lack of respect and disregard for the younger talent.  Young people coming out of college and grad school with fresh ideas and concepts are basically treated like idiots.  Because of this, there's an enormous amount of young employee turnover, because there's better companies out there with a fresher and more vibrant corporate culture.

Unfortunately this produces a number of tenured long time employees that no longer have motivation, lack engagement, and skew the compensation profiles which ultimately leads to a culture that cannot compete with modern companies.

Inordinate policies around supplier manager, finance, and most everything else create an enormous support organization that costs the company and sucks the life out of everyday work for those that are actually contributing to creating airplanes.\r\n\r\nI also think Boeing struggles with coordination among it many different business units and organizations. One arm seemingly does not know what the other is doing, as though he company is too big for it's own good. Contributing to this are the number of outdated critical business tools and seemingly refusal to modernize.\r\n\r\nHaving been an engineer and now an engineering manager, I can say Boeing has problems with how it values it's first level managers. The position has financial disincentive (up to 5% more pay at the expense of loss of overtime and loss of Union incentives) while being a considerably more stressful, difficult, and unrecognized position with a worsening work/life balance. Boeing's engineering managers are considerably underpaid compared to market rate relative to Boeing's engineers, as demonstrated by the fact that Boeing recognizes a level 4 engineer equivalent to an engineering  manager.

If you are not born in the US, or are not Caucasian, you will not be entitled to a professional opinion and a comparable work statement to your white peers - period.

You will consistently receive lower raises than your peers despite the same performance scores, your promotion is the lowest priority compared to your peers, and you will pad the bottom of the retention pool (you will be top priority target for a layoff, unlike your white peers - there are always other minorities they could hire to check the box). \r\n- Employees who are not born in the US or are non-Caucasian are not welcome (or even treated as equals to their white peers). Among many other examples, I witnessed a highly acclaimed senior structural designer (with 25+ years of experience in the industry including well known drone projects), holder of a PhD and an MBA from the most reputable technical college in the world  be given menial work unrelated to his discipline for years (the said engineer was Korean). Basically, if you are not born in the US, don't start your career at Boeing with any hopes of a merit-based advancement, or even being treated as an equal with professional decency: most people who run the place don't consider you entitled to that and you are expected to just be happy you have a job there. They probably wouldn't hire you if they had other ways of showing that they are indeed an EOE. \r\n- Internal interview processes are often manipulated by managers who would tell their preferred candidates what questions would be asked and specifically what answers the interview panel wants to hear for every interview question. Then, the same managers will sit on the interview panel to influence the panelist in their candidate's favor.

Please manage your expectations and don't start your Boeing career under the assumption that Boeing is a fair and merit-driven place to work in if you are not white. \r\n- There is so little ethical oversight, that there are bible studies during work hours led by senior managers and technical fellows. If you are lucky enough to be invited, it is most likely a sign that your career is about to advance.  Otherwise, you are simply not given the opportunities, which are instead given to the bible study regulars. Early in my career, I was told by a senior manager that \"so long as you deny our savior [I am not religious at all], you won't go anywhere\". If you ever find yourself in a situation like that and you are not Christian, or simply are not religious in any way, don't take a stand. Just forget about it, you won't go anywhere.

Supposedly there are efforts to change this and start to unite them more \u2013 I am skeptical because I feel like there are many \u201cinitiatives/goals\u201d that higher-level leadership says/thinks about, but the individual contributors never see the fruits of that labor unless it\u2019s by accident/for some other reason.\r\n\r\nDESIGN \u2013 Expectations vs. Realities of Most Engineers & Tech Designers\r\nBoeing does NOT innovate on a widespread level; by that I mean, there is innovation, but only on a few (FEW) select teams. The rest of the teams are mostly reviewing specifications and preparing and reviewing drawings in a database so that the designs can be implemented on the planes. This is a routine task, not really an engineering/technical task; it\u2019s generally repetitive. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s simple, but it\u2019s more a tedious task than a mentally stimulating task. If you are looking for a job where you drive design changes from scratch, you will not have that experience here at all. That is OK for many people, but PLEASE BE AWARE of this. Most of the \u201chard engineering\u201d is done by suppliers and/or outsourced labor in other Boeing locations. Many engineering roles turn out to be about coordination of groups rather than doing the actual analyses/calculations and/or designing from scratch.\r\n\r\nREWARD/SENSE OF VALUE\r\nThis is subjective, but this is lacking. I see many people who just show up for a paycheck. That is sad because this is a company that can pick whomever it wants (in any graduating class of engineers\u2026no one, unless they are lying, would be upset to get an offer from Boeing). Coming out of college or out of smaller companies might give people the impression that they will be more engaged in the design/production of the airplane at Boeing. However, it is very easy to be totally removed from the final product. Yes, we all have our roles to contribute to a huge end goal, but this is draining, especially on teams that do not support production directly. Many people are put on these \u201cless essential\u201d teams, but they would be more objectively useful on the teams that support production. That being said, the inessential teams (as well as, unfortunately, the more objectively important teams) get almost no support on a regular basis...on top of already being treated as low-priority yet being expected to deliver constantly. This MATTERS because it is easy to become detached from your work when you do not support product and when you get reminders daily that your work is less important. If you are on a design team, expect to have deadlines, too, and lots of pressure because you are often the most important contact for almost everyone. Any team as an engineer/tech designer involves being overloaded with work without management support to alleviate or mitigate that workload in a sustained way.\r\n\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN\r\nNothing could prepare an engineer/tech designer for the influence of Supply Chain. Boeing feels more like a business that has engineers rather than an engineering company that does business. Just like between engineering design teams, there are misaligned priorities between Supply Chain and Engineering organizations. This causes so many problems. Supply Chain is too large an organization and has its hands in everything. This is problematic because engineering groups are limited in their ability to effect change in the company. Business (Supply Chain) determines the \"changes\" in the company.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION\r\nThis is an issue \u2013 this is not a negligible problem. I wish it were treated with a seriousness relative to its impact on everyday life. This affects every single aspect of your day and ability to get your job done. Because managers do not have hard conversations with problematic employees, many employees continue to treat others like trash within their team and outside of their team. Then other teams get ignored by each other regularly because EVERYTHING is a priority, and management doesn\u2019t try to rectify this by being clear about what is important and cutting off the things that are unimportant. Supposedly, some will say, \u201cthat\u2019s the only way things will get done [if everything is a priority].\u201d I don\u2019t know\u2026since it seems like when everything is a priority, a lot never gets done yet the expectation that everything is completed still exists. And all it does is fester hatred and a dead-eyed approach to work.\r\n\r\nThe way people speak to others here is atrocious. Having worked in other jobs, no one would get away with the brattiness and condescension I\u2019ve witnessed here. People whining to other employees about being asked to do their job/tasks that only they are authorized to do. People telling others that they have screwed up an entire project when they\u2019re doing their best in a difficult situation - it is OK not be be happy with people, but turning it into a \"blame game\" is wrong. People cursing at others. People screaming at others for not understanding. God forbid someone decides that maybe treating other people better and with understanding \u2013 and doing their actual job description without whining (if there is a complaint, go to your manager \u2013 don\u2019t sass at the person who is asking you\u2026because you would not be approached if you were not assumed to be the contact).\r\n\r\nI am disgusted by the blind eye that all levels of management give to bad behavior. Soft skills make a company culture. There is no value placed on that here. And there isn\u2019t even a lot of design work here. It\u2019s repetitive and slow. It\u2019s focused on shareholder values. It\u2019s focused on money. It\u2019s being reminded that you are a body.\r\n\r\nThe toxic work culture is the worst part of Boeing. Higher management does not know/acknowledge how its indecisiveness wreaks havoc on the lower management and individual team members...and then wonders why things don't get done quickly or at all."}, {"review_title": "Surprise, it's a big company.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Jun 2008", "job_title": " Financial Analyst  in Huntington Beach, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best would have to be the benefits that are included in the compensation package.  100% company funded health insurance, very generous 401k matching contributions, a pension, great educational funding, and 3 weeks of paid vacation that really works out to be 4 or 5 weeks because of the ability to flexibly schedule your 40 hrs of work.", "cons": "Suffers from the same bureaucracy that is probably common in almost any Fortune 500 sized company."}], [{"review_title": "Good engineering experience in aerospace.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Industry leader in aerospace and manufacturing.

It's as if the company is betting their entire future on what these new employees may be able to provide vs. what the current employees do provide. If you're in your 40's, or above, your future is pretty much set in stone. Reaching a technical level 4 is probably it. Level 5's and above, as well as older level 4's, are always at risk of being tossed out due to the salary they're being paid. The company is trying to migrate to an average technical level somewhere between 3 and 4. Once you move from reviews that 'exceed expectations' to ones that simply say 'met expectations', you know your time is limited.\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to move into management your future is wide open. Staying in a technical track will never keep pace w/ the management track when it comes to salary and bonuses. Bonuses on the management side are nearly double that of the technical side. Side note, if you are female and/or a member of some sort of defined minority class then more possibilities exist now and into the future. Problem the company has now IMO is people who probably shouldn't even work there are taking the management track and it's starting to show in the decisions being made. Managers are rarely if ever put on the street for poor decisions, but, simply moved to other areas 'more fitting'. \r\n\r\nRecent contract wins for military items have increased the number of technical opportunities present, but, you will work long hours with little to no overtime pay under a schedule that is not achievable. Your bonus will not make up for these long hours. Accolades will go to the management and exec levels at the expense of the technical levels. You will have to dial back your expectations of reality as well. Think you can get a project done in a year? No, better plan on three. And, it will be way over budget. All of these things will be out of your control. \r\n\r\nFor the most part your work will be judged on how well it looks in PowerPoint opposed to what actual contribution it has to the performance of the product or the bottom line. I've seen a number of technically bad ideas actually make it into a product. Some of the most basic of engineering concepts are lost on a number of both new, and, seasoned employees. Questioning these ideas will only bring shame upon yourself unless you're willing to really stand up to them and call them out for the junk science they are. Most are not willing to do this and simply keep quiet, or, leave the company. \r\n\r\nWork output expectations from new hires is typically low. In fact most expectations are low when it comes to new hires. Show up when you want, leave when you want, Don't want to work on something? That's OK, here's something more interesting. I'll have the seasoned engineers do your real work for you. \r\n\r\nAn 80% solution to a problem is OK because the company will just propose to fix the other 20% in the next contract proposal. Then do only 80% of that requirement. On and on and on....Now you know why a hammer costs the government a million dollars. Why fix a problem when there is more money to be made in prolonging the problem.\r\n\r\n2019 will be the first year where the company has a tiered plan when it comes to medical cost deductions. The less pay you make, the less you pay in medical premiums. Some will pay nothing this year. They say the executive level will pay the most but I seriously doubt that as there are typically employment contracts which dictate nearly all exec perks. For a number of years we had a no-cost HSA but the deductibles kept creeping up. This year we still have the high deductibles, but, there are monthly deductions now.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have children, 2019 and beyond is the year to do so. Three months of paid time off along w/ 12 weeks of FMLA as well as short and long term disability pay if you want to go that route. I would expect you could have a child, take 3 months off, work on making another and then in 9 months, take off again. Some people could do this a number of times and do little actual work all while getting full pay and bonuses. If you're spouse works there then these benefits apply to them as well. \r\n\r\nIf you make it 10 years at Boeing you will find it very difficult to move away from the company and expect to make something close to what you were making.

The performance management process at Boeing is broken, which is great for an average engineer, but terrible for the high performers.

Boeing is also going through cost reduction exercises with intentional reduction of advancements above grade 3.\r\n\r\nIn-line advancement beyond grade 3 is difficult and beyond grade 4 doesn't happen. For experienced staff, Boeing requires applying for a new position and these positions are often open to external candidates, so they are competitive. It is unclear if Boeing gives internal candidates any preference in the hiring process. It is no different to applying to another position at any other company, so there is little incentive to remain at Boeing if you find a better offer elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTools and methods in some disciplines, like structural analysis, lag behind those used in other industries. Boeing doesn't pay for training beyond grade 2, it is on your own time.

You wont get good raises but you wont get fired either. Perhaps that should have been a con....", "cons": "The difference in annual raises for someone that worked their butt off and someone that is average is roughly 1-2%. Average raises are in the 3-4% range with \"good\" years in the 5-6% range. Save the company a billion dollars? Here's a 5% raise! After a while, you realize that the extra 1-2% isn't worth the hassle of working so hard....\r\n\r\nThe company demographics are horrible. There is almost nobody there aged 35-55 with 15-25 years experience. It's those with less than 10 years and those with over 25 years and that's it. As a new hire or mid-level engineer, you're basically waiting for a bunch of old, fat white guys with 30+ years in to retire or die before you can truly move up the ranks. Half of them hate working there and wax nostalgic about the good ol' days from 20+ years ago. \r\n\r\nThe negativity in the workforce ingrained over the last decade has become a cancer that has infiltrated the entire company. In their defense, much of this attitude has been a direct result of an adversarial and irrational relationship between top management and the engineers - care of the now (thankfully) former CEO. Maybe in another decade you might actually find people that enjoy working at this company again, but for now, morale is very low and people are frustrated with a company that is only a shell of what it used to be. Many of the older workers are on cruise-control, just waiting out the next 3-5 years before they can retire.\r\n\r\nWith the loss of pensions, the trend of job-hopping rather than staying at one company, and big software firms nearby paying big bucks, I can't imagine most new hires will last the 15-20 years necessary to become replacements for the experts that will soon be retiring. The company reminds me much of IBM circa 1995...\r\n\r\nBean counters run the company. Prepare to spend 1/3 of your time giving status, planning, and tracking once you hit mid-level. Despite all of that planning and tracking, things are still late and over budget. \"But *this* time we'll fix it all!\" This has driven the very same bean counters to demand more and more work be outsourced to outside companies. I have seen many unique, highly technical design jobs shipped out and never to return again. These are projects that get done once every decade or so. Sending it out even once means that the next time you want to do it internally, you'll be forced to re-invent the wheel since nobody will be around that remembers how to do it. I've even had the pleasure of major work being outsourced only to have that very same outsourcing company contact us directly and ask if we knew of another company that could do the work since they didn't actually know how but accepted the work anyway. This is the insanity that has become decision making at The Boeing Company.\r\n\r\nThe company is over-reliant on processes. Ordering a box of screws from an outside vendor takes four separate people to process and approve the order and another half dozen to receive and deliver it 2-3 weeks later - if it doesn't get lost somewhere inside the company beforehand. This is something that I could order myself with a credit card in 10 minutes and have at my door in a few days. They took away purchase cards from engineers many years ago because they thought they were too wasteful.  Starting to see the pattern yet?\r\n\r\nA laughably weak engineers union: Paid overtime (time plus $6.50, don't ask why) is great when you see folks in software working 60-70+ hours a week and getting paid for 40. However, the same union has made it difficult for management to fire the truly incompetent and/or lazy. Compound that over 40+ years and you end up with some truly stupid people being paid large sums of money to do nothing of actual value. The worst part is, many of these people don't even realize how truly screwed they would be if they had to find a job anywhere else. For instance: I have worked with \"engineers\" with over 20 years \"experience\" that could barely manage to produce work I would expect an intern to do and ask technical questions so basic that I wonder if they have serious memory problems. Layoffs are also done roughly based on seniority - which is exactly how they ended up with the horrible demographics they currently have in the first place. New hires notice that they get the axe while some seriously stupid people get to stay and guess what?

This creates a company where people either learn to \"do their time\" and lose their passion or they leave the company.  Many talented young people are coming to the company, getting frustrated with this culture and leaving.  Facilities/offices are generally pretty crappy and drab, and parking is a nightmare at the major sites.  There seems to be an expectation in the Puget Sound that regardless of where you live you will eventually have to commute to a different site, regardless of how much this may impact your life or family.  Despite this, senior management seems to be completely uninterested in investing in any kindof inter-site transportation, or even building enough parking spots for employees to reasonably get to work.  I have honestly spent over an hour, multiple times trying to find a place to park when coming to Renton site or Everett site mid-day for a meeting.

Boeing provides a pretty liberal vacation/sick policy compared to a lot of companies I've heard about. The retirement benefits are pretty decent despite the recent changes, however for new employees there is no longer a pension plan available which makes working here less worth it in my opinion. The same goes for the education programs. They used to be top-notch, but because of the recent changes they are as decent as many other companies within my field now.\r\n\r\nThey also changed their health care plans recently under the guise of \"even before the recession, we had a top-notch plan compared to our competitors\". Probably the biggest benefit of working here is that it's pretty stable. Even if a program gets slashed, they will find a new place for you. The St. Louis facility is mostly military projects, so it's all funded by government contracts.", "cons": "Boeing has all of the typical big company pitfalls, such as lack of communication across departments (especially across different sites within the country), lots and lots of red tape and bureaucracy, too many middle management positions that need to be slashed but never will, so much overhead that you find yourself spending at least a good hour or two a day dealing with overhead BS at your job (whether it's useless training courses, etc.). This place is very baby-boomer heavy as other posters have mentioned. They are a few years away from retirement.\r\n\r\nBoeing is very good at making up its own terms and its own initiatives and never following industry trends for software engineering for example. Lots of processes need serious revamping. This company has an extremely change-resistant culture. People are very used to doing things the same way they did 20+ years ago and would rather never change it despite today's rapidly dynamic economy. Over the years, I have seen many people attempt to introduce recent industry trends into the particular group. It's all started but then dies out after a few months. Depending on where you work in the St. Louis facility, many of the facilities are just awful. You don't even have your own cube unless you're a manager. The area Boeing is at in St. Louis is just slummy and depressing. There are a ton of people in this place that shouldn't have a job here.

You can rely on working the minimum 40 hours a week.  If you go over, you can flex it, and no one will think any less of you - unless there's an impacting customer issue, of course.  For younger hires, going to school while working at Boeing is pretty easy if you don't have a family.  Boeing has a decent education reimbursement program to facilitate this.  \r\n+ Good Total Compensation:  Many people complain that they aren't compensated well at Boeing.  It's true they do not pay top salary for most job positions, however, they make it up in a comprehensive benefits package as well as a lot of off-time in the form of holiday, sick leave, AND vacation time.  Salaried even gets over time.  Also, union positions are in no position to complain about their salary.  \r\n+ A Position for Everyone:  Boeing hires everything from aerospace engineers and accountants to firefighters and weathermen.  If you want to do a career change, you don't have to leave the company to do it.\r\n+ Job Security:  You have to actively try to get fired.  It's really obscene.  I never saw someone get fired for poor job performance.  You can only get fired if you do something really blatant like steal from the company, start a fight, bring a gun, intimidate someone - basically anything that can cause legal trouble for Boeing if they don't fire you.  Boeing makes a lot of headlines when they do layoffs, but quite frankly, I didn't know anyone who got laid off who didn't see it coming.  Boeing keeps programs going well after the point that they should have been killed off.", "cons": "+ Slow Pace:  Boeing, along with the rest of the airline industry, is obsessed with safety.  As a result, the pace of innovation is very slow.  Few people in the company get to really push boundaries and make a dent in the universe.  Those that do have to stay with the company for years - it takes a long time to make/change an aircraft design.  \r\n+ Lazy Culture:  Because of the obscenely high amount of job security, good compensation, and slow pace, the large portion of the population is complacent.  Those who want to change the world and make a difference leave, leaving a bunch of B level performers.  New \"As\" either turn back around and leave, or they themselves become complacent, having no reason to try hard.  Even the best aerospace engineers typically leave and come back as a consultant, getting paid even more than what Boeing already offers the engineering union.  \r\n+ Ageism:  There's a huge age gap in the company in all areas.  This often manifests itself in impatient \"kids\" wanting to do something new, but are actively discouraged or ignored by the \"old timers\" who think they know the right way to do everything.  Promotions are only partially merit based, and much of it requires a certain number of years at a certain level as per the \"process\".  There are many 1st level managers who go their position solely because they've been at the company for decades with no excuse to let them go.  \r\n\r\nOverall, I recommend Boeing for those who prioritize a stable job and good work life balance over anything else - it's a good family job.  Also, engineers (those that can get a SPEEA union job) should go into Boeing.  No brainer.  The compensation and job security are stupidly high for SPEEA.  \r\n\r\nFor those ambitious with their career, look elsewhere, because Boeing will make you dumb and lazy if you're not careful."}, {"review_title": "Relaxed work environment, but no job security.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "24 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Renton, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not as high pressured as some other companies.

(How do sites within the same company \"bid\" for engineering work?)  Furthermore, their biggest new site, Charleston, has extraordinarily incompetent engineers (but they're cheaper, so why not) that are being propped up by bright contract engineers while upper management attempts to lure more permanent and competent engineers there to train them. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the company managers routinely lie to the engineers about work and future prospects to cut costs.

Senior Management tend to reward like thinking and overlook those who question the status quo....even when those questions are professional, appropriate, and highly thoughtful.  \r\n\r\nThe Boeing legacy is rich in developmental history, technology, and foresight, however, the current environment does not even recognize the value of contributions from acquired organizations (e.g. Hughes, North American, Rocketdyne, etc.).  In truth, there is still exists quite a bit of the Boeing vs. Mac Dac/Hughes/etc. mentality.  Additionally, the management emphasis is on cultural diversity, but it is defined in gender and ethnic terms and not by experience or professional background.  There are other aerospace organizations that place a higher value on diversity of experience than Boeing.  And that will ultimately be Boeing's downfall.  \r\n\r\nFew if the senior managers ever get out and spend any time with the employees.  They tend to be isolated and removed from day-to-day issues, pressures, problems and opportunities.  For example, the head of the technology division did not speak to his 25,000 employees until he had been in the job for 18 months.  And then the communication was via a one way web-cast.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, employees are rarely listened to.  The words and music are good, but they are not backed up by actions.  There is extensive talk about knowledge management, information access and sharing, and shared values/culture.  In practice however, there is little sharing and a lot of information hording.  One has to know to who to talk to in order to get information."}], [{"review_title": "Hopefully this will help others...", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "14 Jul 2018", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Germantown, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1) Great health benefits.

Better than inflation, but not by all that much. Promotion raises are bad as well and even after you've moved up a level, they don't increase your raises by all that much.\r\n3) We are required to take a lot of useless training every year. It's perhaps useful the first year you take it, but not after that.\r\n4) The career ladder grinds to a halt once you hit senior engineering level (level 4 and above, highest non-executive level is 6). Climbing the ladder while remaining technical is extremely hard to do, and requires a lot of ambition and a little bit of luck. Becoming a manager may be a bit easier, but by doing so you sacrifice your ability to do technical work.

One nice thing about Boeing is the ability to cross over into different careers and get exposure to the rest of the company.  You can also work in many different cities which is a nice flexibility.

This is an old style, industrial/military-orientated company.  Your upward progression in this company will be at a snail pace, unless you're absolutely brilliant and solve world hunger.  \r\n\r\n3)  Promotions and raises are flawed.  Because of the Unions at Boeing, you're too protected and normalized with the rest of your peers.  For example, there's people who cool their heels on their desk and are absolutely not productive at all and they get a 4% raise.  However, if you bust your butt and work really hard, you'll manage to get a 4.5% raise.  I swear I've seen many people sleeping at their desk at work.\r\n\r\n4)  The most irritating thing about Boeing Management is how they are decades behind current industry standards and modern concepts.  It's definitely an old-man's company.  Most of the engineers you see are gray, balding, and pushing retirement.  There's not enough young blood to come in and take over the domain knowledge of the business.  As such, there's a complete lack of respect and disregard for the younger talent.  Young people coming out of college and grad school with fresh ideas and concepts are basically treated like idiots.  Because of this, there's an enormous amount of young employee turnover, because there's better companies out there with a fresher and more vibrant corporate culture.

Unfortunately this produces a number of tenured long time employees that no longer have motivation, lack engagement, and skew the compensation profiles which ultimately leads to a culture that cannot compete with modern companies. There may well be many opportunities for younger employees in the next decade but Boeing has to figure out how to keep them around in a competitive employment market while also navigating through ongoing cost initiatives (layoffs, reduction in raises/benefits, ...) that disproportionately affect the younger population.\r\n\r\nThe company is too bureaucratic which directly affects the long term ability to compete. Inordinate policies around supplier manager, finance, and most everything else create an enormous support organization that costs the company and sucks the life out of everyday work for those that are actually contributing to creating airplanes.\r\n\r\nI also think Boeing struggles with coordination among it many different business units and organizations. One arm seemingly does not know what the other is doing, as though he company is too big for it's own good. Contributing to this are the number of outdated critical business tools and seemingly refusal to modernize.\r\n\r\nHaving been an engineer and now an engineering manager, I can say Boeing has problems with how it values it's first level managers. The position has financial disincentive (up to 5% more pay at the expense of loss of overtime and loss of Union incentives) while being a considerably more stressful, difficult, and unrecognized position with a worsening work/life balance. Boeing's engineering managers are considerably underpaid compared to market rate relative to Boeing's engineers, as demonstrated by the fact that Boeing recognizes a level 4 engineer equivalent to an engineering  manager.

You will consistently receive lower raises than your peers despite the same performance scores, your promotion is the lowest priority compared to your peers, and you will pad the bottom of the retention pool (you will be top priority target for a layoff, unlike your white peers - there are always other minorities they could hire to check the box). \r\n- Employees who are not born in the US or are non-Caucasian are not welcome (or even treated as equals to their white peers).

Basically, if you are not born in the US, don't start your career at Boeing with any hopes of a merit-based advancement, or even being treated as an equal with professional decency: most people who run the place don't consider you entitled to that and you are expected to just be happy you have a job there. They probably wouldn't hire you if they had other ways of showing that they are indeed an EOE. \r\n- Internal interview processes are often manipulated by managers who would tell their preferred candidates what questions would be asked and specifically what answers the interview panel wants to hear for every interview question. Then, the same managers will sit on the interview panel to influence the panelist in their candidate's favor.

Please manage your expectations and don't start your Boeing career under the assumption that Boeing is a fair and merit-driven place to work in if you are not white. \r\n- There is so little ethical oversight, that there are bible studies during work hours led by senior managers and technical fellows. If you are lucky enough to be invited, it is most likely a sign that your career is about to advance.  Otherwise, you are simply not given the opportunities, which are instead given to the bible study regulars. Early in my career, I was told by a senior manager that \"so long as you deny our savior [I am not religious at all], you won't go anywhere\". If you ever find yourself in a situation like that and you are not Christian, or simply are not religious in any way, don't take a stand. Just forget about it, you won't go anywhere.

The diversity in terms of age/race/gender is what I would expect by generation and in terms of hierarchy (i.e., the younger/lower-level generation of employees is essentially what any company would be aiming for in terms of a diverse workforce, and the diversity within the older/higher-level generation of employees is what you would expect with some nice surprises).\r\n\r\nThis review is NOT to say that you should not work here.

Yes, but this is a review for Boeing, so I think being vague by saying something like, \u201cIt\u2019s what you\u2019d expect from a big corporation,\u201d is a disservice.

Please join (or reject) the company with open eyes. You will be better for it because you can go in being more honest with what you expect/want out of a job/this job.", "cons": "CAMARADERIE/SUPPORT\r\nManagement is hit or miss. Teams are hit or miss. Management does NOT have hard conversations with problematic employees to address poor performance or behavior that is unacceptable (how people communicate...or don't). This is not speculation. It is obvious based on the types of interactions I have with/have seen between other employees (newer and older). The negative behavior exhibited did not develop overnight. They have been in the works, but rather than nipping those habits in the bud, management lets it slide. The way people speak to each other/ignore each other is a problem because this is how there can be entire teams that do not progress.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL VS. MANAGEMENT PATHS\r\nThis will come up often. Unfortunately, there is a gap between technical and management paths. Supposedly there are efforts to change this and start to unite them more \u2013 I am skeptical because I feel like there are many \u201cinitiatives/goals\u201d that higher-level leadership says/thinks about, but the individual contributors never see the fruits of that labor unless it\u2019s by accident/for some other reason.\r\n\r\nDESIGN \u2013 Expectations vs. Realities of Most Engineers & Tech Designers\r\nBoeing does NOT innovate on a widespread level; by that I mean, there is innovation, but only on a few (FEW) select teams. The rest of the teams are mostly reviewing specifications and preparing and reviewing drawings in a database so that the designs can be implemented on the planes. This is a routine task, not really an engineering/technical task; it\u2019s generally repetitive. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s simple, but it\u2019s more a tedious task than a mentally stimulating task. If you are looking for a job where you drive design changes from scratch, you will not have that experience here at all. That is OK for many people, but PLEASE BE AWARE of this. Most of the \u201chard engineering\u201d is done by suppliers and/or outsourced labor in other Boeing locations. Many engineering roles turn out to be about coordination of groups rather than doing the actual analyses/calculations and/or designing from scratch.\r\n\r\nREWARD/SENSE OF VALUE\r\nThis is subjective, but this is lacking. I see many people who just show up for a paycheck. That is sad because this is a company that can pick whomever it wants (in any graduating class of engineers\u2026no one, unless they are lying, would be upset to get an offer from Boeing). Coming out of college or out of smaller companies might give people the impression that they will be more engaged in the design/production of the airplane at Boeing. However, it is very easy to be totally removed from the final product. Yes, we all have our roles to contribute to a huge end goal, but this is draining, especially on teams that do not support production directly. Many people are put on these \u201cless essential\u201d teams, but they would be more objectively useful on the teams that support production. That being said, the inessential teams (as well as, unfortunately, the more objectively important teams) get almost no support on a regular basis...on top of already being treated as low-priority yet being expected to deliver constantly. This MATTERS because it is easy to become detached from your work when you do not support product and when you get reminders daily that your work is less important. If you are on a design team, expect to have deadlines, too, and lots of pressure because you are often the most important contact for almost everyone. Any team as an engineer/tech designer involves being overloaded with work without management support to alleviate or mitigate that workload in a sustained way.\r\n\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN\r\nNothing could prepare an engineer/tech designer for the influence of Supply Chain. Boeing feels more like a business that has engineers rather than an engineering company that does business. Just like between engineering design teams, there are misaligned priorities between Supply Chain and Engineering organizations. This causes so many problems. Supply Chain is too large an organization and has its hands in everything. This is problematic because engineering groups are limited in their ability to effect change in the company. Business (Supply Chain) determines the \"changes\" in the company.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION\r\nThis is an issue \u2013 this is not a negligible problem. I wish it were treated with a seriousness relative to its impact on everyday life. This affects every single aspect of your day and ability to get your job done. Because managers do not have hard conversations with problematic employees, many employees continue to treat others like trash within their team and outside of their team. Then other teams get ignored by each other regularly because EVERYTHING is a priority, and management doesn\u2019t try to rectify this by being clear about what is important and cutting off the things that are unimportant. Supposedly, some will say, \u201cthat\u2019s the only way things will get done [if everything is a priority].\u201d I don\u2019t know\u2026since it seems like when everything is a priority, a lot never gets done yet the expectation that everything is completed still exists. And all it does is fester hatred and a dead-eyed approach to work.\r\n\r\nThe way people speak to others here is atrocious. Having worked in other jobs, no one would get away with the brattiness and condescension I\u2019ve witnessed here. People whining to other employees about being asked to do their job/tasks that only they are authorized to do. People telling others that they have screwed up an entire project when they\u2019re doing their best in a difficult situation - it is OK not be be happy with people, but turning it into a \"blame game\" is wrong. People cursing at others. People screaming at others for not understanding. God forbid someone decides that maybe treating other people better and with understanding \u2013 and doing their actual job description without whining (if there is a complaint, go to your manager \u2013 don\u2019t sass at the person who is asking you\u2026because you would not be approached if you were not assumed to be the contact).\r\n\r\nI am disgusted by the blind eye that all levels of management give to bad behavior. Soft skills make a company culture. There is no value placed on that here. And there isn\u2019t even a lot of design work here. It\u2019s repetitive and slow. It\u2019s focused on shareholder values. It\u2019s focused on money. It\u2019s being reminded that you are a body.\r\n\r\nThe toxic work culture is the worst part of Boeing. Higher management does not know/acknowledge how its indecisiveness wreaks havoc on the lower management and individual team members...and then wonders why things don't get done quickly or at all."}], [{"review_title": "Good place to start out.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Jun 2008", "job_title": "Business Analyst in Renton, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Since Boeing is a large company they make it easy to transfer between jobs and areas within the business.

Boeing has less COBOL, but it's common to see very, very, very old languages.

Combined with the restriction from asking technical questions during an interview, this leaves unqualified individuals, with excellent flattery abilities, leading the organization. I had two software managers: one was formerly an HR manager and the other was a sales manager because, at Boeing, managers can move horizontally across completely unrelated business units. Managing is always the same right?\r\n\r\nIt gets better when working with the software architect who is an English major.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult, if not impossible, to do anything the right way. The decision makers and those advising the decision makers are usually the weakest technically. Plus, they can't expose their incompetence, so they never ask questions. No engineer want's to create a bad product though, so a lot of time is spent explaining things to these decision makers. \r\n\r\nThis leads me to something I almost forgot: time tracking. Boeing has a modern version of the punch card; they added the ability to charge to different groups and an alert system to notify managers of \"noncompliance.\" An example will explain how bothersome this is:\r\n\r\nYou go to your manager asking to explain something. She asks you to pause as she switches her time card to reflect this informal meeting. Then asks you to do the same and you reply with what to charge to. Now, as you explain to her, you have to read her eyes to pry what she still doesn't understand. After that meeting, you go back to your desk and change the time card again, satisfied with the great explanation only to find an e-mail 5 minutes later asking for a summary of the meeting. Now you have to switch your time card again, write up the summary, and switch once again upon completion.\r\n\r\nI've described many cons, but overall, Boeing isn't a terrible company."}, {"review_title": "Boeing is a nice company with a great product......but you will be underpaid", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jan 2014", "job_title": "Senior Product Manager in Renton, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great product (Commercial Airplanes) and there is a lot of pride in the work they do.

Every last one of them is afraid of making a call. They all just wait around for some other manager to make a decision so they cant be blamed if it turns out bad.

Then, this new manager that doesn't know you gets to write your performance review and blame your previous managers for anything negative in it. \r\n There are far to many non work related tasks that are asked of employees. Safety focal, tool focal, FOD focal, safety observations, 5S, etc.\r\n They always seem to have new and inventive policies for you to violate in order to give you a CAM. And of course, a CAM equals no pay raise that year.\r\n They are also prone to going into panic overtime mode due to not meeting poorly estimated timelines given to customers or contract bids. This panic overtime usually equal 12 hour shifts 7 days a week. But of course, managers \"aren't allowed\" to work overtime.\r\n If you need a tool or have an idea how to fix or make something better, be ready to fork over a TBBI, VSM, time study, cost analysis, etc. Then wait a few months or years.\r\n The quality assurance department is typically filled with very un-knowledgeable know it alls.

On the other hand, as such a very large company it is not easy to distinguish yourself on an exceptional level.\r\n\r\nCompensation and benefits are pretty good.  They have a nice tuition assistance program if you'd like to get that Masters.  It used to be much better but it's definitely something people should take advantage of if they can.\r\n\r\nOf course it depends on where you are, what you do, and what union you may be in but for the most part job security is very high.  In fact, to get fired from Boeing you practically have to put a concentrated effort into it.  As for layoffs, aerospace is very cyclic and you just need to be aware of your role and how it pertains to those cycles.  Put some thought into what you do or want to do and how much it is a 'recurring' vs a 'non-recurring' requirement where you are.\r\n\r\nIn the event that your job is 'phased' out Boeing does make an effort to find you work elsewhere if you're an engineer.  It might be out of your own pocket and you might be moving to another state, but they will give you that option for the most part.  They never will cut your pay, even if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living.", "cons": "Well, number one and probably the most well known problem Boeing has is the 'age gap.'  You have a growing, younger workforce in their late 20's to early 30's and then you have your over 50 crowd.  There is a disturbing lack of many people that don't fall into either bucket.  The reasons for that are layoffs based on seniority in the past primarily but there are other factors.  It's not as bad as it was, of course, but the damage has been done.  There have been plenty of opportunities to diminish this risk for a long time now and it's frequently just been talk and not action.  We're at point that it's getting too late for even action.  Boeing does not understand or acknowledge the technical and engineering skills they are going to lose en masse in 2016, and they can talk about it all they want but they haven't put any concentrated effort into mentoring or knowledge transfer from that 50+ to that 20-35 crowd.  We'll see if they can 'weather the storm' as I have resigned myself to seeing as their 'solution' to this problem.\r\n\r\nThe benefits, while decent, have consistently been cut and scaled down especially over the last few years.  Even for union folks.  New employees no longer get a pension and it's being actively phased out for all existing employees depending on their union status.  I have no problem with this, but many do.\r\n\r\nPromotions are awful.  As an engineer you are evaluated by a team of your peers called a \"skill team.\"  Many of these individuals aren't in a place to evaluate expertise in a given skill, and, for my job code at least, there are over 20 'skills' and you have to be at or above a certain level of proficiency in required number of skills for each 'level.'  \r\n\r\nThis is often very unfair because of the sheer number of these skills and how vague and pointless many of them are to your particular role--nobody is going to be able to realistically develop all of them or even need to for them to be an excellent engineer.  The way it is currently structured you might have to do something entirely non value added and of no value to your organization or the company or yourself just so you can advance your 'skill matrix.'  Unfortunately many folks have to get very creative and perhaps not entirely honest about these 'skills' and the 'examples' required to prove what level they're at and it just ends up being a completely meaningless and ultimately political process.\r\n\r\nBoeing hires way too many managers over technical or engineering people with little to no technical experience.  That would be fine if they would stick to management and utilize their employees knowledge and expertise to make decisions.  Unfortunately there are a lot of people with BA degrees that think directly managing engineers makes them one!\r\n\r\nOvertime, if that's your thing, isn't what it used to be.  You may have heard the concept of nearly 'unlimited' overtime in Boeing.  While that is still true in some places, don't structure your lifestyle around overtime.  I hate overtime and have never run my life around it but many people do.  That's standard advice for any employee, but it's especially prudent now.  First level managers don't get paid for OT anymore as of this year and, what do you know, there's a massive effort to reduce OT so those guys don't have to draw the lottery to see who works that weekend (for free).  \r\n\r\nAs an engineer that works OT when necessary (no more than a few weekends a year if I can possibly avoid it), I have found all requests denied in lieu of flexing my time where it would never have been a problem whatsoever in the past.  Flexing is a good option to have, but it's still a net loss in work necessary beyond regular time.  Of course, as production rates increase and are poorly coordinated and planned the old \"unlimited OT\" might come back but keep it in mind if it's your thing."}], [{"review_title": "What have they done to the once proud giant?", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "9 Jan 2015", "job_title": "Instructional Designer, LTD Engineering in Everett, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Exposure to great engineers and engineering, a chance to get up close and personal with very large planes and equipment.", "cons": "Top-down, authoritarian management often adds stress where none is needed.

There are always layoffs and, during my time there, it seemed like everyone who was above a level 2 employee was just counting the days until they were cut. I never had a meeting or even a casual conversation with a coworker in which layoffs didn't come up as a topic. The only employees who weren't worried about layoffs were us young employees who weren't making enough money as it was. It was quickly made clear that as soon as you were making a real salary, you were going to be replaced by young, cheap labor.\r\n\r\n2. Every piece of software used at Boeing was made in the 80s and is horribly broken. Because of the layoffs, no one is there long enough to truly learn the software and Boeing will never let the programmers replace the broken stuff. Instead, everything is patched together just  long enough to keep it running until that programmer is inevitably let go. After that, it's the new, underpaid employees problem.\r\n\r\n3. If you graduated college, you are wasting your degree here. Almost all of the work that I did was busy work. It included entering data into databases and troubleshooting horrible, patched together code. It was work that I could have done in high school. I never once utilized anything that I learned in college. I feel like my critical thinking skills probably decreased in the time I was there because they absolutely never used.\r\n\r\n4. You will be stuck on a single project and that is where you will stay. If you are interested in working on a different product, tough luck. Whoever is on that project will never let you in because they are too terrified of looking replaceable and as soon as you look replaceable, you are gone.\r\n\r\n5. Boeing is a massive company and you will feel it. You will work in a room of 400 other IT workers and that room will be one of 20 just like it in your building.
