Hearing from customers, feel bad for them buying planes and services from Boeing, because they don\u2019t really know what they are getting into until 5 years into service. Products integrity and reliability, service performance are not performing per contract. Airplanes are marketed inconsistent to how they perform. If it is not for duopoly reason (Boeing and Airbus dominating the industry), BCA would be bankrupt already due to disasters on 737MAX and 787. Sadly these events will not be the last time Boeing faces it, something else will come up\u2026\n\nAlso problem with Boeing internal bureaucracy is HUGE.

Hearing from customers, feel bad for them buying planes and services from Boeing, because they don\u2019t really know what they are getting into until 5 years into service. Products integrity and reliability, service performance are not performing per contract. Airplanes are marketed inconsistent to how they perform. If it is not for duopoly reason (Boeing and Airbus dominating the industry), BCA would be bankrupt already due to disasters on 737MAX and 787. Sadly these events will not be the last time Boeing faces it, something else will come up\u2026\n\nAlso problem with Boeing internal bureaucracy is HUGE. Internal teams fight each other over who should own actions, they all push around saying that budget or resources constraint is prevalent.

Yeah that's right, you read that right ! Then watch the heck out ! Because you'll be blamed for something you were completely not at fault for and had nothing to do with. Except what was done In accordance with the specs and pubs. But none of that matters because what will potentially happen is you'll be blamed for it being built by a complete other shift the incorrect way. Whats even crazier is you would also not even be on the buy-off list of signatures for items up for sale, yet you're still magically being blamed for it ?!?! Huh..?? Even when they do an investigation they will most likely find that no errors on your part. Then when they see that - that didnt work, they will get a completely different person to investigate the situation and explain to you that you did nothing wrong. But they will not have the guts to do the right thing and tell them that. So guess what pall ? Her boss will ! This dewy ! Didn't even interview you nor did he investigate what took place so this guy ain't gotta clue ! So then basically your the one whos automatically at fault no matter what !

In addition there is rarely consensus from the powers that be over the priority of work. As you might imagine this does not exactly create a calm workplace that is conducive to doing your best work.\r\n\r\nThe companies age can also lead to a bit of an old boys club in certain areas, where if you haven't been there for at least a decade don't bother your opinion will not be taken into account.\r\n\r\nPay is a bit on the low end.
