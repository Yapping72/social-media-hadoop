These were both under the Defense/Space side of Boeing, so I can only speak about my experience within that branch of the company.\n\nBUREAUCRACY: \nBoeing is a huge company, so there\u2019s a stifling amount of bureaucracy that you have to deal with here. Literally every step of your work has to be reviewed and approved by several people. Boeing loves to preach about innovation but the truth is that the bureaucracy stifles any breath of innovation, as there\u2019s almost always a mentality of, \u201cWe\u2019ve always done things this way! It works, so don\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nINCOMPETENT MANAGEMENT:\nAlmost all of the managers I worked with were frustrating to work with in some capacity, and many really didn't seem to care about their employees:\n\nI was initially hired to work as a DSP Algorithms Engineer at Boeing. After a few months, I realized that the type of work that they do (Simulink & Matlab) was not what I wanted to spend 8-9 hours of my day on, so I asked management if I could switch to a team that works on software. They were initially understanding and supportive of my decision, but after only about 3 months being able to work on software, they pulled me back into doing systems engineering work for 6 months. The worst part was that they did not even give me this news through an in-person chat (this was pre-COVID); they simply notified me through an email... Because nothing screams \"we care about our employees\" like telling them they have to immediately switch back to doing the work they disliked for half a year through an email...\n\nAnother manager that I worked with for my first program basically micromanaged me and constantly asked me for my progress status almost every day at a certain point, because the program had slipped in schedule. I was a new-hire at the time, and was the only person actively working on verification, so I have no idea how they expected me to meet their schedule virtually alone.\n\nThe final task I had to complete for the systems engineering team before switching to the software team for the first time was a software tool to allow the hardware team to do some of their verification testing. This same manager slept on the code that I gave their team for 9 MONTHS before properly testing it, and then expected me to prioritize working on his program to debug that software tool while also working full-time on the software team. They had the audacity to claim that their program had \u201ca much more pressing schedule\u201d than the software team's, yet somehow didn't bother to test my software tool with their hardware for 9 months.\n\nAnother manager that I worked under did not seem to understand that I was frequently being pulled into doing work for both the systems and the software teams at the same time due to program schedules. They kept insisting that I put in a full 40 hours a week to keep up with my software tasks, and to only work on the \u201curgent\u201d systems engineering task as overtime. This was right when COVID-19 and lockdowns were starting, and everyone was already anxious about the situation. Because I was frequently being bothered by my former team and the hardware team to help debug work that I hadn't touched for nearly a year, I was unable to complete all of the tasks I was given on the software team in time. This was held against me by this manager, who didn't allow me to officially switch into the software team due to many of my software tasks slipping schedule. Frustratingly, this same manager was the one that told my primary manager to reassign me back into doing systems work in the first place. They had me reassigned to a team outside of software, yet when I was back on software, complained that I wasn't getting the work done in time, which was also partly due to my lack of experience with the processes that the software team followed, which I could've avoided if I was never reassigned outside of the software team in the first place. This pathetic excuse of a manager was the biggest reason why I eventually left, as they obviously did not care about their employees.\n\nLACK OF HANDS-ON WORK:\nBoth teams that I worked on while at Boeing involved working with the hardware. However, we engineers on these teams did not get the opportunity to WORK on or test our designs/code on actual hardware. Instead, ALL of the work that we did was tested in simulations. Yes, Boeing is so compartmentalized that the people who do hands-on testing with the hardware are completely separate teams, and in my experience, I never even worked with them. If you're like me and enjoy working with/seeing the physical side of your engineering efforts, Boeing is probably not the company you want to work for...\n\nDEPRESSING WORK ENVIRONMENT: \nAcross the 2 teams that I worked with while at Boeing, I worked in 3 different locations. All 3 were cube farms, with the last one before I left being the most depressing of all; it was basically a giant warehouse with about 100 cubes crammed into it. It was stuffy, contained no windows, and suffered from bad lighting. Forcing everyone to work from home because of the COVID situation was actually a bit of a blessing in this sense, as I no longer had to come into a stuffy, depressing cube farm everyday.\n\nLACK OF AMBITION:\nLike I said in the Pros section, many of the people (non-managers) I worked with were good and smart people, but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find any employees who truly enjoy their job and look forward to coming in to work everyday. A large amount of the people I worked with were either complacent in their current role or were applying to leave the company as soon as they could. This is a company where your ambition dies the longer you stay here."}, {"review_title": "nice", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Feb 2022", "job_title": "CNC Machinists", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good pay i love it all", "cons": "none i love it all"}, {"review_title": "Ndt", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Feb 2022", "job_title": "NDT Inspector in Everett, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good benefits for your family", "cons": "Pay not as good until you have been here long time"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Verificaiton Engineer in Oklahoma City, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work place environment for all", "cons": "No issues at all.

This is exemplified by the major projects seen in the news but it permeates throughout smaller projects as well. These issues then cause more schedule delays which the PMO and executives blame engineers for being slow and inept when in fact they didn't want to hear it in the first place, leading to a toxic work cycle for those looking for a technical place to grow and succeed. Trying to come up with the best technical solution and technical due diligence is seen as \"wasting time and money.\"\n\nWhen leaders say they're there to help provided resources, they just call daily or weekly meetings for updates and to ask when it's going to be done and what's taking so long. They don't give REAL resources to drive closure to the problem at hand nor the freedom for engineers to develop the best solutions, only enough time, money, and pressure for band-aid solutions.

The management team is failing me, not the company. However, the company does not provide many outlets for employees to voice their issues. In my last company, I had a clear understanding of where to go and the outcome benefited me and also benefited the manager in a way. \n\nThere was a brief occurrence where I was judged on my uniform, but I clearly stated I was not staying in the office. If a company wants to promote inclusion and bring itself to work, management should not quickly judge someone's business professional attire. Why does someone have to wear a suit and tie to simply pick up something from their desk knowing they do not have meetings or will not interact with others. \n\nAlso even if you work around the clock, it's not good enough for management. They do not say outright to work weekends and holidays but everyone does it. If you do not, then you're behind. I never was really able to disconnect during PTO, as work was always on my mind. Compared to my last company, the PTO at Boeing is better but depends on the team you work with. \n\nI do not feel welcomed and I am looking elsewhere for other opportunities to pursue my dreams to continue in the aviation industry. The office I work at unfortunately has limited opportunities and it is a challenge to do interesting things\n\n\n- Management is not clear on expectations\n- Management does not understand the picture"}, {"review_title": "Avoid unless desperate for a job", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Order Manager in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good health insurance and retirement programs", "cons": "Technologically they are stuck in the 1990's.

These were both under the Defense/Space side of Boeing, so I can only speak about my experience within that branch of the company.\n\nBUREAUCRACY: \nBoeing is a huge company, so there\u2019s a stifling amount of bureaucracy that you have to deal with here. Literally every step of your work has to be reviewed and approved by several people. Boeing loves to preach about innovation but the truth is that the bureaucracy stifles any breath of innovation, as there\u2019s almost always a mentality of, \u201cWe\u2019ve always done things this way! It works, so don\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nINCOMPETENT MANAGEMENT:\nAlmost all of the managers I worked with were frustrating to work with in some capacity, and many really didn't seem to care about their employees:\n\nI was initially hired to work as a DSP Algorithms Engineer at Boeing. After a few months, I realized that the type of work that they do (Simulink & Matlab) was not what I wanted to spend 8-9 hours of my day on, so I asked management if I could switch to a team that works on software. They were initially understanding and supportive of my decision, but after only about 3 months being able to work on software, they pulled me back into doing systems engineering work for 6 months. The worst part was that they did not even give me this news through an in-person chat (this was pre-COVID); they simply notified me through an email... Because nothing screams \"we care about our employees\" like telling them they have to immediately switch back to doing the work they disliked for half a year through an email...\n\nAnother manager that I worked with for my first program basically micromanaged me and constantly asked me for my progress status almost every day at a certain point, because the program had slipped in schedule. I was a new-hire at the time, and was the only person actively working on verification, so I have no idea how they expected me to meet their schedule virtually alone.\n\nThe final task I had to complete for the systems engineering team before switching to the software team for the first time was a software tool to allow the hardware team to do some of their verification testing. This same manager slept on the code that I gave their team for 9 MONTHS before properly testing it, and then expected me to prioritize working on his program to debug that software tool while also working full-time on the software team. They had the audacity to claim that their program had \u201ca much more pressing schedule\u201d than the software team's, yet somehow didn't bother to test my software tool with their hardware for 9 months.\n\nAnother manager that I worked under did not seem to understand that I was frequently being pulled into doing work for both the systems and the software teams at the same time due to program schedules. They kept insisting that I put in a full 40 hours a week to keep up with my software tasks, and to only work on the \u201curgent\u201d systems engineering task as overtime. This was right when COVID-19 and lockdowns were starting, and everyone was already anxious about the situation. Because I was frequently being bothered by my former team and the hardware team to help debug work that I hadn't touched for nearly a year, I was unable to complete all of the tasks I was given on the software team in time. This was held against me by this manager, who didn't allow me to officially switch into the software team due to many of my software tasks slipping schedule. Frustratingly, this same manager was the one that told my primary manager to reassign me back into doing systems work in the first place. They had me reassigned to a team outside of software, yet when I was back on software, complained that I wasn't getting the work done in time, which was also partly due to my lack of experience with the processes that the software team followed, which I could've avoided if I was never reassigned outside of the software team in the first place. This pathetic excuse of a manager was the biggest reason why I eventually left, as they obviously did not care about their employees.\n\nLACK OF HANDS-ON WORK:\nBoth teams that I worked on while at Boeing involved working with the hardware. However, we engineers on these teams did not get the opportunity to WORK on or test our designs/code on actual hardware. Instead, ALL of the work that we did was tested in simulations. Yes, Boeing is so compartmentalized that the people who do hands-on testing with the hardware are completely separate teams, and in my experience, I never even worked with them. If you're like me and enjoy working with/seeing the physical side of your engineering efforts, Boeing is probably not the company you want to work for...\n\nDEPRESSING WORK ENVIRONMENT: \nAcross the 2 teams that I worked with while at Boeing, I worked in 3 different locations. All 3 were cube farms, with the last one before I left being the most depressing of all; it was basically a giant warehouse with about 100 cubes crammed into it. It was stuffy, contained no windows, and suffered from bad lighting. Forcing everyone to work from home because of the COVID situation was actually a bit of a blessing in this sense, as I no longer had to come into a stuffy, depressing cube farm everyday.\n\nLACK OF AMBITION:\nLike I said in the Pros section, many of the people (non-managers) I worked with were good and smart people, but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find any employees who truly enjoy their job and look forward to coming in to work everyday. A large amount of the people I worked with were either complacent in their current role or were applying to leave the company as soon as they could. This is a company where your ambition dies the longer you stay here."}, {"review_title": "Getting better!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer -2 in Long Beach, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work/life balance is great, priorities are clear.", "cons": "It's not tech, so aerospace is very slow and it might impact innovation."}, {"review_title": "nice", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Feb 2022", "job_title": "CNC Machinists", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good pay i love it all", "cons": "none i love it all"}, {"review_title": "Ndt", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Feb 2022", "job_title": "NDT Inspector in Everett, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good benefits for your family", "cons": "Pay not as good until you have been here long time"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Verificaiton Engineer in Oklahoma City, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work place environment for all", "cons": "No issues at all.

No idea about technology, training, or business, for that matter. Anyone with a brain entertained themselves during these nonsensical diatribes by playing buzzword bingo to try to stay awake.

Leaders just want short term results and lack true long term vision. This leads to half-baked, lackluster engineering solutions that require significant updates because project leads don't listen to the technical input. This is exemplified by the major projects seen in the news but it permeates throughout smaller projects as well. These issues then cause more schedule delays which the PMO and executives blame engineers for being slow and inept when in fact they didn't want to hear it in the first place, leading to a toxic work cycle for those looking for a technical place to grow and succeed. Trying to come up with the best technical solution and technical due diligence is seen as \"wasting time and money.\"\n\nWhen leaders say they're there to help provided resources, they just call daily or weekly meetings for updates and to ask when it's going to be done and what's taking so long. They don't give REAL resources to drive closure to the problem at hand nor the freedom for engineers to develop the best solutions, only enough time, money, and pressure for band-aid solutions. Given so many leaders pride themselves on being both business and tech savvy, it's a surprise they fall for the sunken cost fallacy so easily.\n\nMost technically capable employees see this culture and are leaving in droves.to competitors.

Since when I was younger I knew I wanted to work in aviation. My last job was not a good fit for me and when I accepted this job I knew I would enjoy it. I was welcomed even with limited experience in the subject matter. I felt welcomed by every team member and I also saw the amazing benefits the company offered. I felt like I found my dream job to an extent. However, I had other experiences that others on my team did not have and I felt that was my advantage. I had support from others within the company to always do the best I can, even if I was not learning as fast as others wanted me to learn. COVID happened, and the challenge to work at home worked out for me, but only to an extent. The company has visions for inclusion and to end racism, but not for all groups. \n\nOverall:\n\n- Have exciting products\n- Have nice facilities\n- Great benefits \n- Can work on really interesting stuff", "cons": "Things have been turning for the worse for me where management has viewed me in a different light, compared to my more experienced colleagues. The interesting thing is many people tend to \"fake it to you make it or lie on their resume.\" I did not and it seems management regrets hiring someone with limited experience. I have been told I have other issues I need to fix, but will not provide concrete written examples. Furthermore, due to COVID, the company did a major rehaul in business units and where they fall. Only time will tell if this will actually work. The company promotes inclusion and diversity, yet there are certain groups the company has failed to even put out a statement. The management team is failing me, not the company. However, the company does not provide many outlets for employees to voice their issues. In my last company, I had a clear understanding of where to go and the outcome benefited me and also benefited the manager in a way. \n\nThere was a brief occurrence where I was judged on my uniform, but I clearly stated I was not staying in the office. If a company wants to promote inclusion and bring itself to work, management should not quickly judge someone's business professional attire. Why does someone have to wear a suit and tie to simply pick up something from their desk knowing they do not have meetings or will not interact with others. \n\nAlso even if you work around the clock, it's not good enough for management. They do not say outright to work weekends and holidays but everyone does it. If you do not, then you're behind. I never was really able to disconnect during PTO, as work was always on my mind. Compared to my last company, the PTO at Boeing is better but depends on the team you work with. \n\nI do not feel welcomed and I am looking elsewhere for other opportunities to pursue my dreams to continue in the aviation industry. The office I work at unfortunately has limited opportunities and it is a challenge to do interesting things\n\n\n- Management is not clear on expectations\n- Management does not understand the picture"}, {"review_title": "Review", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Big impact on the world", "cons": "Bad management, don\u2019t support victims of harassment, low pay"}, {"review_title": "Avoid unless desperate for a job", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Order Manager in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good health insurance and retirement programs", "cons": "Technologically they are stuck in the 1990's.
