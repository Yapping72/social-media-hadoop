There is a huge hierarchy and control mechanism, but little structure that actually promote productivity or innovation by listening to the voices of employees who are on the line doing the work.  Everyone understands a business has to turn a profit but Shareholder profit is definitely #1 driving force in the company and it is very difficult to get motivated behind that as an employee as it really only benefits the executives.    \"customers are demanding lower prices\" is the mantra used to justify cuts to employees.  \r\n\r\nThere does appear to be some higher level organizational realization on many of these issues (which is encouraging), but it is going to take a long time to make changes, and much of the management hierarchy will resist this as they will realize their jobs are the ones that probably need to go away."}, {"review_title": "Formerly Great Company Now in Total Freefall", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "6 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Senior Project Manager in Everett, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Relocation packages for working level employees\r\n- Quantity of locations from which to work\r\n- Decent Tuition Assistance for STEM fields\r\n- Improving Intern programs\r\n- Top level executives are above average\r\n- Work/Life balance above average", "cons": "- Salary well below average\r\n- Continued cutting of benefits, health care plans/options\r\n- Ongoing contraction of overall headcount having significant impact on retaining good talent\r\n- Horrendous Middle Management\r\n- Promotions based on who you know, not what you do\r\n- No exit interview process - people are currently leaving the Company in significant numbers and no one asking why on the way out\r\n- Significant levels of bureaucracy crushes any vestige of creativity or ability to improve on a very large number of processes and procedures\r\n- No places for growth in current environment \r\n\r\nIf you are a young person considering joining Boeing, look elsewhere.

You choose your path...You can get away with minimal work.", "cons": "You get sucked into the slow motion, and it's very easy to fall into a comfort zone where you neither progress nor digress. You can see 8 years fly by and you're doing the same thing, which is not mentally stimulating anymore and when you consider moving to a different job you realize your degree has 8years of dust on it and no longer feel you have the skill acquired through your degree to really apply to a job that requires it."}, {"review_title": "No longer a good long-term career choice", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "5 Jul 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you are a union-represented engineer: good benefits and opportunities to get some technical training.

The opportunity to work with some very smart people.", "cons": "Restrictive skill/job codes that limit movement which used to be a major benefit. Increasingly difficult to move to the next pay scale. Too many levels of management and frequent re-organizations which impacts productivity.

I've worked in a few other areas of Boeing before coming to Accounts Receivable, and your mileage will vary depending on which department you work for and who you work for. With that said, AR has been an incredibly difficult department to work in. It is a 70 hour job in a 40 hour work week, and it wasn't always like that. The effort to bring down cost through lowering our head count has contributed to the biggest part of this problem.
