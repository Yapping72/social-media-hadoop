You bring up these issues and they rarely, if ever, get resolved. They promote and hire people for positions that they aren't qualified to fill. Managers are yes-men and bow down to managers of other groups every time and will never stick up for you.

Not many opportunities at this site to move around and grow. You'll be stuck at your position if you take a role at this site. You're essentially a computer, same work every single day. You get reprimanded for leaving your desk even though that's part of your job to inquire about work on the vehicle. You get snitched on for little things like taking a break after working for a constant 2 hours of knocking out work. The management does not seem to understand the day-to-day operations of the engineering roles on site. Managers are in to favorites and giving them raises, bonuses, promotions, etc. Managers never address the lack of training. Managers show that they don't consider what is told to them from employees regarding process decisions and day-to-day operations. It's a lot of talk around here and no action.
