They start off with the leftovers, which luckily has some diamonds in the rough. These \"diamonds,\" along with any talent, leave the company within 1-3 years.\r\nIt's a breath of fresh air to finally meet someone that knows what he is talking about, but then devastating to see him go 6 months later.\r\n\r\nBoeing isn't a software company, so an appropriate comparison is with Bank of America, with their 1 million lines of COBOL. Boeing has less COBOL, but it's common to see very, very, very old languages. Join this company if you like time travel.\r\n\r\nBoeing has a level hierarchy and believes anyone can transfer to completely different jobs while maintaining his or her level. Combined with the restriction from asking technical questions during an interview, this leaves unqualified individuals, with excellent flattery abilities, leading the organization. I had two software managers: one was formerly an HR manager and the other was a sales manager because, at Boeing, managers can move horizontally across completely unrelated business units. Managing is always the same right?\r\n\r\nIt gets better when working with the software architect who is an English major.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult, if not impossible, to do anything the right way. The decision makers and those advising the decision makers are usually the weakest technically. Plus, they can't expose their incompetence, so they never ask questions. No engineer want's to create a bad product though, so a lot of time is spent explaining things to these decision makers. \r\n\r\nThis leads me to something I almost forgot: time tracking. Boeing has a modern version of the punch card; they added the ability to charge to different groups and an alert system to notify managers of \"noncompliance.\" An example will explain how bothersome this is:\r\n\r\nYou go to your manager asking to explain something. She asks you to pause as she switches her time card to reflect this informal meeting. Then asks you to do the same and you reply with what to charge to. Now, as you explain to her, you have to read her eyes to pry what she still doesn't understand. After that meeting, you go back to your desk and change the time card again, satisfied with the great explanation only to find an e-mail 5 minutes later asking for a summary of the meeting. Now you have to switch your time card again, write up the summary, and switch once again upon completion.\r\n\r\nI've described many cons, but overall, Boeing isn't a terrible company."}, {"review_title": "Boeing is a nice company with a great product......but you will be underpaid", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jan 2014", "job_title": "Senior Product Manager in Renton, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great product (Commercial Airplanes) and there is a lot of pride in the work they do.

Every last one of them is afraid of making a call. They all just wait around for some other manager to make a decision so they cant be blamed if it turns out bad. But not to worry, you will get a new manager every few weeks or months. Then, this new manager that doesn't know you gets to write your performance review and blame your previous managers for anything negative in it. \r\n There are far to many non work related tasks that are asked of employees. Safety focal, tool focal, FOD focal, safety observations, 5S, etc.\r\n They always seem to have new and inventive policies for you to violate in order to give you a CAM. And of course, a CAM equals no pay raise that year.\r\n They are also prone to going into panic overtime mode due to not meeting poorly estimated timelines given to customers or contract bids. This panic overtime usually equal 12 hour shifts 7 days a week. But of course, managers \"aren't allowed\" to work overtime.\r\n If you need a tool or have an idea how to fix or make something better, be ready to fork over a TBBI, VSM, time study, cost analysis, etc. Then wait a few months or years.\r\n The quality assurance department is typically filled with very un-knowledgeable know it alls.  Many of them seem to have been put there because they can't or wont fire them but want them off the aircraft in a maintenance capacity. As a whole the QA personal are very adversarial. \r\n If you give 110% your only reward is more being asked of you. This usually means you get to do all of your work and some of someone else's.\r\n It seems to me that there a far more \"support\" and \"overhead\" people than aircraft touch labor workers. I constantly see new people with grand sounding titles that seem to do little to nothing value added (that's some Boeing speak). In fact, the support usually wants you to do all the work for them. But of course they don't work overtime, nights, or weekends so good luck finding one to hand over the work you did for them.\r\n The list goes on and on but the bottom line is, if you are looking for a place to just do your job and collect your check, then the Boeing Company is most definitely not for you."}, {"review_title": "Great Benefits, at the Price of Being in a Dilbert Comic Strip", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "10 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Software Engineer II in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The Learning Together Program.

It's very easy to stand out in most areas--in many places you can 'stand out' by simply being mediocre if that's your thing!  On the other hand, as such a very large company it is not easy to distinguish yourself on an exceptional level.\r\n\r\nCompensation and benefits are pretty good.  They have a nice tuition assistance program if you'd like to get that Masters.  It used to be much better but it's definitely something people should take advantage of if they can.\r\n\r\nOf course it depends on where you are, what you do, and what union you may be in but for the most part job security is very high.  In fact, to get fired from Boeing you practically have to put a concentrated effort into it.  As for layoffs, aerospace is very cyclic and you just need to be aware of your role and how it pertains to those cycles.  Put some thought into what you do or want to do and how much it is a 'recurring' vs a 'non-recurring' requirement where you are.\r\n\r\nIn the event that your job is 'phased' out Boeing does make an effort to find you work elsewhere if you're an engineer.  It might be out of your own pocket and you might be moving to another state, but they will give you that option for the most part.  They never will cut your pay, even if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living.", "cons": "Well, number one and probably the most well known problem Boeing has is the 'age gap.'  You have a growing, younger workforce in their late 20's to early 30's and then you have your over 50 crowd.  There is a disturbing lack of many people that don't fall into either bucket.  The reasons for that are layoffs based on seniority in the past primarily but there are other factors.  It's not as bad as it was, of course, but the damage has been done.  There have been plenty of opportunities to diminish this risk for a long time now and it's frequently just been talk and not action.  We're at point that it's getting too late for even action.  Boeing does not understand or acknowledge the technical and engineering skills they are going to lose en masse in 2016, and they can talk about it all they want but they haven't put any concentrated effort into mentoring or knowledge transfer from that 50+ to that 20-35 crowd.  We'll see if they can 'weather the storm' as I have resigned myself to seeing as their 'solution' to this problem.\r\n\r\nThe benefits, while decent, have consistently been cut and scaled down especially over the last few years.  Even for union folks.  New employees no longer get a pension and it's being actively phased out for all existing employees depending on their union status.  I have no problem with this, but many do.\r\n\r\nPromotions are awful.  As an engineer you are evaluated by a team of your peers called a \"skill team.\"  Many of these individuals aren't in a place to evaluate expertise in a given skill, and, for my job code at least, there are over 20 'skills' and you have to be at or above a certain level of proficiency in required number of skills for each 'level.'  \r\n\r\nThis is often very unfair because of the sheer number of these skills and how vague and pointless many of them are to your particular role--nobody is going to be able to realistically develop all of them or even need to for them to be an excellent engineer.  The way it is currently structured you might have to do something entirely non value added and of no value to your organization or the company or yourself just so you can advance your 'skill matrix.'  Unfortunately many folks have to get very creative and perhaps not entirely honest about these 'skills' and the 'examples' required to prove what level they're at and it just ends up being a completely meaningless and ultimately political process.\r\n\r\nBoeing hires way too many managers over technical or engineering people with little to no technical experience.  That would be fine if they would stick to management and utilize their employees knowledge and expertise to make decisions.  Unfortunately there are a lot of people with BA degrees that think directly managing engineers makes them one!\r\n\r\nOvertime, if that's your thing, isn't what it used to be.  You may have heard the concept of nearly 'unlimited' overtime in Boeing.  While that is still true in some places, don't structure your lifestyle around overtime.  I hate overtime and have never run my life around it but many people do.  That's standard advice for any employee, but it's especially prudent now.  First level managers don't get paid for OT anymore as of this year and, what do you know, there's a massive effort to reduce OT so those guys don't have to draw the lottery to see who works that weekend (for free).  \r\n\r\nAs an engineer that works OT when necessary (no more than a few weekends a year if I can possibly avoid it), I have found all requests denied in lieu of flexing my time where it would never have been a problem whatsoever in the past.  Flexing is a good option to have, but it's still a net loss in work necessary beyond regular time.  Of course, as production rates increase and are poorly coordinated and planned the old \"unlimited OT\" might come back but keep it in mind if it's your thing."}], [{"review_title": "Stable with benefits but lacking engagement and perspective", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "14 May 2015", "job_title": " in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Boeing is a good company to work for if you are looking for a lifetime career.

I applied for a Design Engineer position, and had an interview over the phone. It was 5 STAR questions, and we didn't talk about my resume or engineering at all. I asked what the position exactly was, they couldn't tell me. Said they would follow up in 2-3 weeks - all of a sudden, 6 weeks later, they offer me a job. Now, don't get me wrong, I didn't think I would be taking a gamble on accepting an offer at Boeing. I figured, at worst, I would be a design engineer on a boring commodity, but I would at least be doing \"engineering\" in the literal sense. Move out to WA only to find out that I am indeed NOT an engineer, but a project manager. Realistically, I would have quit then and there because I have absolutely no interest in that statement of work, but that's out of the question because you have to pay back all relocation assistance if you leave before a year. This is my biggest gripe - they never told me what the job was, I never got to talk with my manager until after I accepted, and was never explicitly told what I would be doing until my first day. I spent a long time interviewing and looking for jobs because I wanted to start somewhere I would want to stay. Every other interview has been extremely transparent and ALWAYS consisted of more than one interview (and in person ones at that). After speaking around, I found out that my resume was pretty much randomly pulled and because it was in the right place at the right time and given to a team that requested some heads. It boggles my mind that such a terrible hiring process is in place. I am grossly under qualified for project management, and despise it - so guess what, I despise coming to work every day. But you know what I signed the paper work for? The job description, the title \"design engineer\", and the brand name of Boeing. So there is someone out there, who would actually like or more importantly be good on the job I am doing right now, but because they spend such bare minimum energy on the hiring process, they get a mixed basket of people who come into work on their first day full of surprises.  \r\n-Most of the software that is used here is archaic, broken, and a waste of time. Very simple tasks can end up taking insurmountable time.\r\n-Work culture promotes \"bare minimum\" attitude (i.e. 40 hours and not a second more)\r\n-No one works the same schedule and no one tells anyone when they are going on vacation (when I say no one, I mean a good number of people, as I am overexaggerating)\r\n-Office has no natural light and looks ugly, making it hard to spend all day there\r\n-Half of my day is spent in meetings where nothing is accomplished besides people talking about things not related to the job\r\n-Receive no feedback on my job performance. Cannot understand how to improve.\r\n-Develop no useful skills for the things that I am trying to build experience for in the future (i.e. design engineering...)\r\n-Teams that I work with are overworked and understaffed - questionable allocation of engineers as such"}, {"review_title": "Boeing, why Work anywhere else!?!!!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Jun 2008", "job_title": "Assembly Mechanic in Renton, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working at Boeing provides opportunities in almost any field available as a career.

If you are in your late 30s with some experience, the coming wave of retirements and the demographic chasm above you means you can rise far and fast if you are smart and good. \r\n\r\nIf you don't want to tell other people what to do but want instead to become an expert on an aspect of aircraft design and construction, the technical fellows program provides another path of advancement. \r\n\r\nBoeing is usually good about work-life balance, but if your group ends up with a compressed schedule, you may find yourself working a lot of extra hours. However, Boeing does pay overtime, which softens the blow when it's necessary.\r\n\r\nChannels of communication on safety issues is excellent. \r\n\r\nEveryone you know is going to use things you worked on (eventually). That's amazingly cool.", "cons": "Boeing loves process more than life. This is necessary for what we do, but it can be draining if you are used to a more free-wheeling environment. \r\n\r\nUpper management is isolated (they in Chicago!!), clueless, and seems to be largely carried by lower level managers, engineers, and production folks. \r\n\r\nOutsourcing reduces the efficiency of development. I find the claim that it reduces costs overall to be a very bad joke, told at our expense. \r\n\r\nParking at the Everett facility is atrocious. They've gotten a good shuttle bus service going in the last year, but it merely makes the situation tolerable rather than good. \r\n\r\nThey eliminated the pension for new hires."}, {"review_title": "Computer-based Training Developer", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "13 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Computer-based Training Developer in Renton, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "semi-decent pay.

Engineers are told to work to deadlines and often they never put a name to face on whose running the show nor see the big engineering picture. Engineers often complain about how management is running the business model and not understanding the time and effort for quality engineering .

A maximum match of 6% is a great deal.\r\n\r\n2. Boeing will pay for your higher education.

Obviously this isn't true, but for people who aspire to go higher it can be very annoying to be confronted with this every day.  A lot of people who may just as well be working a minimum wage job have managed to get into a union and then they are impossible to get rid of.  Lots of behavioral issues among workers that aren't going to go away because it is nearly impossible to fire union employees.  Not everyone is over payed, but for those that are clearly in over there heads in an area can drag morale down and they just throw these bad apples around the company indefinitely.  All part of the culture as a union worker for Boeing.\r\n\r\nManagement is go with the flow or you're out of management.

As the profits increase the wealth I believe should be shared equally but it is not. The bonus pools for upper management in 2012 increased 54%. I believe McNerny's increase in compensation was $23 million dollars. \r\n\r\nIf there are 25 people per supervisor, I would estimate that 4 are not needed. Many are looking to climb the ladder of success but not willing to learn the basics of the job before them. Others are allowed to escape work by attending Safety Meetings, Morale Boosting meetings, any function they can find outside of performing their given tasks, and a good share find they can carry a clip board and find people to socialize with in other areas of the building for hours. Lunch is 40 minutes for the Techs and Profs but 1/hr or more is the norm. Many including Supervisors arrive to work then disappear to eat breakfast in the cafeterias. In my area we had a high grade Manufacturing Engineer who basically made his living off of taking pictures and socializing."}, {"review_title": "Good company, culture can be toxic", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Oct 2014", "job_title": "Business and Planning Analyst in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stable employment, regular hours, flexibility in schedule and tuition reimbursement program.

Employee Incentive Plan bonus is nice but it is not something you as an individual has much control over b/c it is based on the stock rate. Insurance coverage (multiple options) seems decent compared to other large companies but cost has been going up the last 3 years and will continue to. Easy to move around within the company to try new jobs, different locations/cities/states, or different divisions (commercial, defense, services, corporate). Non-management employees get paid overtime (time+$6.50) for more than 40 hrs/wk (not all groups will approve you to work OT depending on the allotted budget though). The airplanes/products we build are pretty cool.", "cons": "Hard to move up in the company. They make it really hard to get promotions even if you work your butt off. There is a pretty strict years of service rule before you can attempt to go to the next level, even if you are already doing the work. It's still a good old boys club and there are lots of office politics and so many levels of management that you have to get buy-in from before moving on with decision making. It is a slow moving world b/c of the approval processes for practically everything. They talk a lot about caring for their people and work/life balance but then they make it really hard to take time off (though I think some of that depends on who your manager is). Most managers are old school but I do think there are more younger managers coming into play now as first levels but they still have to do what their senior managers, directors, and above... tell them to do so it's not as though they have much control. Time keeping is tracked daily and scrutinized even for salaried employees. Vacation and Sick leave are separate buckets. PTO would be so much better like other companies do it. My overall experience with managers who give recognition to their employees is pretty low. They have multiple incentive programs but it seems that most managers (maybe 75%) dont use them. It is very unfortunate. Year end merit raises are a joke (2-3% and dropping) and they are making it harder and harder for you to meet the goals they make you agree to. On the Boeing Commercial side they are forcing a 20% (exceeds) 60% (meets) 20% (does not meet) rule for all non-management employees within each managers team (so if you have 3 people on your team one of you must be put into the \"does not meet\" category.

Reasons included a) not being at the my current position long enough; b) there were other engineers who had been waiting for a promotion longer.\r\n\r\n2) no technical excellence :: there is little or no technical excellence remaining at the company.  much of the engineering work is done from the books, with engineers being reduced to highly paid librarians for customers\r\n\r\n3) aerospace engineering trumps all :: even though one of degrees is in the primary domain of the company, being an engineer of that domain (aerospace) trumps everything else.  as a person with other degrees in software and computational engineering; I often encountered aerospace engineers who could not pass data structures 101 yet were leads for very visible, externally facing software projects.  \r\n\r\n4) everyone is a widget :: management regularly shuffles people around to different jobs as the company constantly tries to restructure.  instead of making employees accountable, management instead places people in areas where they have zero experience or education that qualifies them for the position.  I have seen people with zero engineering background other than act as technical editors become promoted into engineering; only to see them a few years later move to another engineering position in a startup program that requires actual engineer.  Note, people with B.As in English literature are designing your airplanes you ride on.\r\n\r\n5) lethargic, slow :: decisions that take 1 hour to 1 day in my current job have traditionally taken 6-12 months at the Boeing company.  \r\n\r\n6) drowning in people ::  Q: How many Boeing engineers does it take to screw in a light bulb?  A: All of them.  In my current position we are empowered to make business decisions and enact solutions on a regular basis.  More so, many customer-facing initiatives are started and finished in a day.  I have seen similar functionality started at Boeing with 6 or more engineers and take 12-18 months.\r\n\r\n7) there is no IT :: With the exception of IDS (Boeing's Integrated Defense Systems), if you wish to do anything remotely involved with software then this is not a good company to work for.   Programmers are not trained for the work they do, or have any formal training in computer science or software engineering.

Management don't know what it means to develop software, so most projects end up crashing and burning miserably. Your manager is going to have some random degree and experience that has nothing to do with software, and their sole purpose for existing is to do politicking to navigate the bureaucratic mess that is Boeing. \r\n\r\nTech fellows provide zero leadership as they are just as clueless about software development as management is. You will hear comments from them such as \"Is C++ a managed language?\", and no one can tell you why this is simply horrifying to hear from a high-level software engineer when your target language is.... c++. This is a side-effect of an interview process that is 100% behavioral and 0% technical. The type of interviews that politicians and psychopaths excel at.\r\n\r\nEvery project has the stench of bad, bad, code smells. Multi-million dollar a year projects with 20-30 software engineers contributing with absolutely no standardized workflow. People literally just force push to master at will. No code review, no testing, copy-paste code, no CI, no lint or style guide, and huge amounts of resources spent reinventing (poorly) the wheel instead of using COTS software.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't make you recoil in horror read on. Very, very limited job growth opportunities. Ask any team and you'll find that there are level 1 engineers that have been working there for 4-5 years. If this is by design so that it encourages job hopping within Boeing so you get a more varied experience in your career, great! But wait, there's a high chance that even if you find an opportunity elsewhere, you won't be offered relocation. That 10k+ to move across country to get a miniscule raise is coming out of your pocket. This means there's no incentive to actually stay within the Boeing system. Your current wage is actually used as a negotiating strategy against yourself when finding a new job of interest.\r\n\r\nManagement will often tout \"But the benefits are great!\" This is absolutely not the case. Health care insurance is strictly worse at Boeing than the two other companies I've worked at since. 3.6k deductible and a 7k out-of-pocket max with monthly premiums that are exactly the same as the traditional plans I got at the other companies. Pay is woefully under market value for a software engineer. If you're a mechanical, industrial engineer, I'm sure it's fine. But it simply doesn't match the lucrative market for software engineering, as Boeing lumps all engineers into one bucket.\r\n\r\nIf you're stuck in the Charleston area, then I'm not sure there's a lot of better choices. If you're a young software engineer reading this fresh out of school thinking this is your opportunity to put a fortune 500 company on their resume, save yourself from wasting your time with what will be the inevitable. Do not come to Boeing South Carolina. The young software engineers that Boeing captures through its university outreach program leave in droves for a reason. I suggest embedding yourself in a tech city with multiple alternative opportunities if your first choice doesn't work out.\r\n\r\nIf you think I'm exaggerating about any of this, due your own due diligence and please try the simple test of asking your interviewers brain dead CS questions like \"what is a compiler?\"."}, {"review_title": "Boeing At its Best", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jun 2008", "job_title": "Industrial Engineer in Everett, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The opportunites for growth at the Boeing Company", "cons": "Working for The Boeing Company there is no downside to it.

Pay is just ok compared to industry and there is usually not a lot of OT required. But that's about it.", "cons": "Boeing is in bad shape as a company. Mostly this is due to their management and workforce practices, but the problems run much deeper. \r\n\r\nFirst the workforce issues. Like all aerospace companies Boeing has a problem with an aging workforce. But the way they handle it is incredible. Instead of trying to pair off younger and older workers to transfer knowledge and experience, or to have subject matter experts teach or give seminars to help the younger employees, their answer is to force the older workers into retirement or layoff and hire college graduates but give them no direction. And the almost religious belief of management is that all they need to do is write better processes. The result is massive amounts of critical knowledge flying out of the door while at the same time young employees are floundering. The defense side has lost so much capability that they can hardly execute on existing programs to say nothing of winning new work. In five years time, Boeing Defense Systems will likely be unable to execute even the most basic efforts.\r\n\r\nSecond is the management practices. Like all large companies, Boeing prides itself on saying all the right things. Ethics, Safety, Diversity, Execution, Innovation are all words that spill from senior management mouths every time they talk. But that's all it is; talk. Boeing encourages deceptive and unethical management practices, not through its words, but through it actions. The micro management pressure brought down on lower level managers is intense. As such, they quickly learn that the way to survive is to ONLY say what the upper levels want to hear. After a while this \"selective disclosure\" becomes second nature. Those that do it best, and those that learn to deflect any bad news to some other manager, quickly get promoted. At each level the problem gets worse. By the time a manager makes Executive level they are almost physically incapable of telling the truth. Everything that comes out of a Boeing Executive's mouth has been filtered to such an extent that none of it can be believed. And the worst part is the Executives don't even seem to realize that it's happening. Or they are just so accomplished that they hide it well. As an employee at Boeing you cannot believe a single word which come out of a Manager's mouth. It's sad but true. A manager will lie to an Engineer with a straight face and zero remorse. They will tell you things that they know to be untrue, and they will throw you to the wolves to advance their career.

I literally had to come to work and do nothing for 8 hours each day.\r\n\r\nAfter that, when I did start working, on a small CRUD web application with one other dev, it was a total disaster. None of the people in charge or clarifying the requirements could agree on anything, so we were working on extremely vague requirements. Everyone I talked to would simply point their finger and someone else. By the time I had resigned, there was STILL no clear requirements. There was also no software development \"process\" to speak of - we were simply handed the very rough draft with vague instructions and told to get it done.\r\n\r\nThe developers in the group seemed to be on a very low level. I never once got a clear answer about anything that I asked anyone. My manager, who was supposedly a developer for over a decade, had never heard of an ORM. This manager was also extremely ineffective - we had bi-weekly meetings but whenever I would ask her about anything, she would say that she didn't know and maybe I should ask someone else. \r\n\r\nWe spent absurd amounts of time having meetings about safety, and watching videos about people doing working on the shop floor, despite the fact that we worked at desks in an office. Our group meetings were nothing but \"flowdown\" from \"the higher ups\" that consisted of topics that were not relevant to anyone in the group. For instance, we once had a long discussion about company cell phone usage despite the fact that no one in the group used a company cell phone. There was NEVER any talk about software development and its quality, despite the fact that we were a software development group - all the talk was about inane Boeing rules, policies, and corporate nonsense. \r\n\r\nEveryone constantly complained and was grumpy. It was the most negative and toxic work environment that I have ever seen. The older people talked constantly about how they couldn't wait to retire, and the younger people were totally disinterested in their work. There were many, many people who would do next to nothing all day every day. There were also widespread layoffs across all of IT that was handled very poorly - and they also laid off the most experienced employees first. \r\n\r\nThere was also constant harping about how we needed to save the company money - by using the website self help instead of calling the IT help desk; by booking the absolute cheapest flights and hotel rooms if travelling - I had one tiny monitor because anything else was \"not in the budget\".

I asked what the position exactly was, they couldn't tell me. Said they would follow up in 2-3 weeks - all of a sudden, 6 weeks later, they offer me a job. Now, don't get me wrong, I didn't think I would be taking a gamble on accepting an offer at Boeing. I figured, at worst, I would be a design engineer on a boring commodity, but I would at least be doing \"engineering\" in the literal sense. Move out to WA only to find out that I am indeed NOT an engineer, but a project manager. Realistically, I would have quit then and there because I have absolutely no interest in that statement of work, but that's out of the question because you have to pay back all relocation assistance if you leave before a year. This is my biggest gripe - they never told me what the job was, I never got to talk with my manager until after I accepted, and was never explicitly told what I would be doing until my first day. I spent a long time interviewing and looking for jobs because I wanted to start somewhere I would want to stay. Every other interview has been extremely transparent and ALWAYS consisted of more than one interview (and in person ones at that). After speaking around, I found out that my resume was pretty much randomly pulled and because it was in the right place at the right time and given to a team that requested some heads. It boggles my mind that such a terrible hiring process is in place. I am grossly under qualified for project management, and despise it - so guess what, I despise coming to work every day. But you know what I signed the paper work for? The job description, the title \"design engineer\", and the brand name of Boeing. So there is someone out there, who would actually like or more importantly be good on the job I am doing right now, but because they spend such bare minimum energy on the hiring process, they get a mixed basket of people who come into work on their first day full of surprises.  \r\n-Most of the software that is used here is archaic, broken, and a waste of time.

In non-management areas, some employees spend full days doing anything but work.

Work offloaded overseas needs continual audit and rework. Have witnessed employees being harassed and bullied. When reported Human Resources and Supervision turns a blind eye. Parking can be horrendous. Employees have already lost their pension, medical payment for co-pays and deductibles are increasing. Merit pools are decreasing. Pay for Performance is a joke. \r\n\r\nBoeing with the realization that Baby Boomers in the thousands will soon retire is hiring new employees at lower and lower salaries. The Baby Boomers with tons of experience also attain very high salaries. Those high salaries will soon disappear. By holding down new hires the company will receive a large boost in profits. Combine that with loss of a pension, increased deductibles, and higher co-pays the company will reap larger profits on the backs of the employees.

Most managers are old school but I do think there are more younger managers coming into play now as first levels but they still have to do what their senior managers, directors, and above... tell them to do so it's not as though they have much control. Time keeping is tracked daily and scrutinized even for salaried employees. Vacation and Sick leave are separate buckets. PTO would be so much better like other companies do it. My overall experience with managers who give recognition to their employees is pretty low. They have multiple incentive programs but it seems that most managers (maybe 75%) dont use them. It is very unfortunate. Year end merit raises are a joke (2-3% and dropping) and they are making it harder and harder for you to meet the goals they make you agree to. On the Boeing Commercial side they are forcing a 20% (exceeds) 60% (meets) 20% (does not meet) rule for all non-management employees within each managers team (so if you have 3 people on your team one of you must be put into the \"does not meet\" category.

I have seen people with zero engineering background other than act as technical editors become promoted into engineering; only to see them a few years later move to another engineering position in a startup program that requires actual engineer.

A: All of them.  In my current position we are empowered to make business decisions and enact solutions on a regular basis.

Management don't know what it means to develop software, so most projects end up crashing and burning miserably. Your manager is going to have some random degree and experience that has nothing to do with software, and their sole purpose for existing is to do politicking to navigate the bureaucratic mess that is Boeing. \r\n\r\nTech fellows provide zero leadership as they are just as clueless about software development as management is. You will hear comments from them such as \"Is C++ a managed language?\", and no one can tell you why this is simply horrifying to hear from a high-level software engineer when your target language is.... c++. This is a side-effect of an interview process that is 100% behavioral and 0% technical. The type of interviews that politicians and psychopaths excel at.\r\n\r\nEvery project has the stench of bad, bad, code smells. Multi-million dollar a year projects with 20-30 software engineers contributing with absolutely no standardized workflow. People literally just force push to master at will. No code review, no testing, copy-paste code, no CI, no lint or style guide, and huge amounts of resources spent reinventing (poorly) the wheel instead of using COTS software.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't make you recoil in horror read on. Very, very limited job growth opportunities. Ask any team and you'll find that there are level 1 engineers that have been working there for 4-5 years. If this is by design so that it encourages job hopping within Boeing so you get a more varied experience in your career, great! But wait, there's a high chance that even if you find an opportunity elsewhere, you won't be offered relocation. That 10k+ to move across country to get a miniscule raise is coming out of your pocket. This means there's no incentive to actually stay within the Boeing system. Your current wage is actually used as a negotiating strategy against yourself when finding a new job of interest.\r\n\r\nManagement will often tout \"But the benefits are great!\" This is absolutely not the case. Health care insurance is strictly worse at Boeing than the two other companies I've worked at since. 3.6k deductible and a 7k out-of-pocket max with monthly premiums that are exactly the same as the traditional plans I got at the other companies. Pay is woefully under market value for a software engineer. If you're a mechanical, industrial engineer, I'm sure it's fine.

Pay is just ok compared to industry and there is usually not a lot of OT required. But that's about it.", "cons": "Boeing is in bad shape as a company. Mostly this is due to their management and workforce practices, but the problems run much deeper. \r\n\r\nFirst the workforce issues. Like all aerospace companies Boeing has a problem with an aging workforce. But the way they handle it is incredible. Instead of trying to pair off younger and older workers to transfer knowledge and experience, or to have subject matter experts teach or give seminars to help the younger employees, their answer is to force the older workers into retirement or layoff and hire college graduates but give them no direction. And the almost religious belief of management is that all they need to do is write better processes. The result is massive amounts of critical knowledge flying out of the door while at the same time young employees are floundering. The defense side has lost so much capability that they can hardly execute on existing programs to say nothing of winning new work. In five years time, Boeing Defense Systems will likely be unable to execute even the most basic efforts.\r\n\r\nSecond is the management practices. Like all large companies, Boeing prides itself on saying all the right things. Ethics, Safety, Diversity, Execution, Innovation are all words that spill from senior management mouths every time they talk. But that's all it is; talk. Boeing encourages deceptive and unethical management practices, not through its words, but through it actions. The micro management pressure brought down on lower level managers is intense. As such, they quickly learn that the way to survive is to ONLY say what the upper levels want to hear. After a while this \"selective disclosure\" becomes second nature. Those that do it best, and those that learn to deflect any bad news to some other manager, quickly get promoted. At each level the problem gets worse. By the time a manager makes Executive level they are almost physically incapable of telling the truth. Everything that comes out of a Boeing Executive's mouth has been filtered to such an extent that none of it can be believed. And the worst part is the Executives don't even seem to realize that it's happening. Or they are just so accomplished that they hide it well. As an employee at Boeing you cannot believe a single word which come out of a Manager's mouth. It's sad but true. A manager will lie to an Engineer with a straight face and zero remorse. They will tell you things that they know to be untrue, and they will throw you to the wolves to advance their career.

None of the people in charge or clarifying the requirements could agree on anything, so we were working on extremely vague requirements. Everyone I talked to would simply point their finger and someone else. By the time I had resigned, there was STILL no clear requirements. There was also no software development \"process\" to speak of - we were simply handed the very rough draft with vague instructions and told to get it done.\r\n\r\nThe developers in the group seemed to be on a very low level. I never once got a clear answer about anything that I asked anyone. My manager, who was supposedly a developer for over a decade, had never heard of an ORM. This manager was also extremely ineffective - we had bi-weekly meetings but whenever I would ask her about anything, she would say that she didn't know and maybe I should ask someone else. \r\n\r\nWe spent absurd amounts of time having meetings about safety, and watching videos about people doing working on the shop floor, despite the fact that we worked at desks in an office. Our group meetings were nothing but \"flowdown\" from \"the higher ups\" that consisted of topics that were not relevant to anyone in the group. For instance, we once had a long discussion about company cell phone usage despite the fact that no one in the group used a company cell phone. There was NEVER any talk about software development and its quality, despite the fact that we were a software development group - all the talk was about inane Boeing rules, policies, and corporate nonsense. \r\n\r\nEveryone constantly complained and was grumpy. It was the most negative and toxic work environment that I have ever seen. The older people talked constantly about how they couldn't wait to retire, and the younger people were totally disinterested in their work. There were many, many people who would do next to nothing all day every day. There were also widespread layoffs across all of IT that was handled very poorly - and they also laid off the most experienced employees first. \r\n\r\nThere was also constant harping about how we needed to save the company money - by using the website self help instead of calling the IT help desk; by booking the absolute cheapest flights and hotel rooms if travelling - I had one tiny monitor because anything else was \"not in the budget\". There was also constant talk about all the financial \"challenges\" that Boeing was having."}], [{"review_title": "Good Pay and Benefits, Complicated Leadership Structure", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Feb 2017", "job_title": "Mechanical Systems Design and Analysis Engineer in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Pay for aerospace, benefits are good, and engineering union keeps things very fair and honest.", "cons": "Frequent layoffs, poor management structure, poor layoff methods.
