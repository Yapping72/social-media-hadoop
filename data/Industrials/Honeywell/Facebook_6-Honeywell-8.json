Morale is pathetic.  Working for them is a huge risk with no long term guarantees. Management makes special considerations to a protected group of people and conflict management is always prevalent in their workforce. This company plays games with its employee's, executes the bait and switch game and more importantly relies on its constant negative rhetoric in every aspect of project planning, execution and policies. Most employees and management are obnoxious, arrogant, narcissistic and are very difficult to work with. Management's ability to be verbally abusive and use profanity is always present daily in meetings, conversations, etc.  Project  teams have communication failures and are difficult to understand due to cultural diversity in the workplace. A significant amount of stress in the workplace exists due to utilization of cultural diversity indifferences globally."}], [{"review_title": "I expected different.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "23 Feb 2017", "job_title": "Project Manager in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Stable company.\n- Ability to work remotely (depending on your position).\n- Great learning resources.\n- A great \"brand name\" company to put on your resume.", "cons": "***Please keep in mind that I was \"hired\" through an acquisition.\n\n- Ridiculous bureaucracy.\n- It felt like an \"old boys club\".

This business has a significant portfolio of mechanical and electronic products that are in nearly every single airplane flying. Many employees are fascinated by aviation, have hobbies related to aviation and are generally very bright, hard working individuals. This industry requires significant optimization and so there is a great deal of satisfaction in solving tough engineering problems. Overall, here is a list of pros:\n\n- if you are on the right project (I.e. new development or research), the work is fascinating.\n- good opportunities for career growth and movement if you have signifiant talent (technical, management or project areas for engineering)\n- benefits are on par with other aerospace jobs. No pension for new hires and marginal health benefits but decent wages, 401k matching and some might like the negotiated vacation plan (you and your manager get to decide how many weeks of vacation you have each year)\n- Phoenix is a great city to live in if you are outdoorsy.

Rebellion of suppliers, huge issues of quality/delivery that are managed through heroic efforts by employees. Engineering is the current scapegoat (for a variety of complex reasons). Large portions of engineering is just focused on processes and manufacturing work-arounds, dogwork with very little innovation (many are reassessing their life priorities here)\n- focus on reducing engineering spend: very little research, plant closure rampant, shifting work to low cost regions at an increasing pace. All companies are doing this, but Honeywell is really starving engineering at a rate that is not comparable to other companies.\n- limited new product development: growth story from corporate disconnected from product ... Corp focused on software-industrial and connected which is generally inappropriate for aerospace since we don\u2019t sell to end consumer. Business unit leadership scared to provide candid feedback so we dilute scarce resources on low value mandates and have few real products in pipeline.\n- superficial employee engagement campaigns but gradual reduction in benefits, stagnant wages and expectations for mandatory overtime. It\u2019s feeling very much like \u201c1984\u201d with the propaganda vs reality.\n- High attrition from retirement and disillusioned new grads when faced with the above.\n\nI would generally tell prospective new employees to carefully examine the work opportunity & product growth plans and ask yourself \u201cwhat do I want to do with my career?\u201d  There are some good opportunities, but the environment is soul-sucking."}, {"review_title": "Lots of challenge and variety but limited advancement opportunities", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Sept 2008", "job_title": "Senior Credit Analyst in Plymouth, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working for Honeywell Turbo Technologies provides the opportunity to learn a wide variety of concepts and to develop many different skills.

However, years ago Honeywell manufactured the best Avionics in the industry and had an outstanding global support force. Now we are more interested in saving $10 a card or box that we can have some other business or country manufacture for us. Problem here is that we lose quality control of that product and it ends up costing us millions when they fail to perform at what we have guaranteed our customers they will.

They made that clear when they hired me.  They asked me multiple times throughout the hiring process if I was aware that I was hiring for a full time travel position as if I had somehow forgotten.  I worked as a field engineer for a few years as one of their new university hires.  If you think that you would enjoy traveling the world and not having a home, I would recommend it, but do think carefully about it - I had studied abroad and traveled some before this, but it's not something to take lightly.  It can get quite lonely, and it also gets tiresome having so many trans-continental flights after awhile, but for the first year or two, it was quite a bit of fun.  I was fortunate to be able to travel with my wife after I got married, which was a nice benefit.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed being able to work with experts in different parts of the oil and gas sector at a very young age in my career, and though the learning curve is quite steep, it is manageable.  Just keep all your resources in hand, be willing to talk to your fellow field engineers and office staff, and you'll be all right.  As a young engineer, you'll be exposed to different ways of thinking, from the refiners that you work with to other areas of the oil and gas sector that you may be introduced to as well as within UOP.  It was a great introduction to being an engineer.  I was also pleased that I was able to work in many different parts of the oil and gas sector, from upstream to downstream, despite UOP having a reputation of predominantly being only a refining company.  I actually thoroughly enjoyed working in the upstream sector, which has a very different feel from refining.\r\n\r\nOnce you start traveling, the pay is quite good.  Prior to that, the salary is somewhat competitive, but nothing compared to say an entry engineer at a supermajor.  If you start working overseas, additional foreign bonus is applied on top of your salary, and if you are leading UOP's work overseas as a chief engineer, you also receive an additional bonus for that, as well as per diem.  Lump all this together and UOP's total compensation package is competitive with supermajor engineers.\r\n\r\nBoth a positive and negative was that I was able to see about a dozen countries on UOP's dime, which was a great experience, but it eventually became overwhelming having to take so many flights so frequently.  My last year, my longest job was only three weeks.  I really wanted to immerse myself in the local culture and learn the local languages, but it's hard to do that when you're only in a country for a few weeks.\r\n\r\nOne final point is that most of the old time engineers are very knowledgeable and personable, as well as a lot of the local engineers at the regional offices.  Everyone is very friendly and willing to help.  I really appreciated this, particularly while being so early in my career.   Every overseas office I went to was extremely friendly and tried to make me feel comfortable and well prepared for whatever job I came to do, which was great.", "cons": "Honeywell continues to clamp down on every aspect of the business, trying to suck UOP dry.  Cost cutting measures keep being aggressively put in place to limit spending with little regard for how this affects the quality of life of the field engineers.  Penny pinching over a few dollars a night spent at an extra hotel.  I was relatively fortunate with regards to this, but I know many who were not.\r\n\r\nUOP lies to its customers and bills them for business class travel and then gets only economy class travel.  I was only able to upgrade my travel to economy plus, and even then, only on long haul, 8+ hour flights, and not to continental Europe.  Doing these long haul flights two or three times a month like I was doing is not healthy or sustainable and was a serious factor in me leaving the company.  Business class would have made this much easier to deal with.  Beyond that, UOP makes you choose amongst the cheapest economy class flights, so frequently you are left with sub-optimal flight plans with nonsensical, excessive layovers and total flight time.\r\n\r\nPer diem is pitifully, hysterically low in the US at $35 per day.  This is completely absurd and should be updated to a reasonable amount.  The only way I was able to stay below per diem while working in the US was to stay at hotels where my wife and I could cook.\r\n\r\nSome engineers had the opposite problem that I did - they would wind up stuck in Southeast Asia for 14 months straight, while I was traveling from one site to another every two weeks.  Both are difficult and are possibilities that are outside of your control as a young field engineer.\r\n\r\nA lot of the engineers in the above situation also had issues getting time off.  I was fortunate with regards to this and never had much of an issue getting time off.  UOP and Honeywell have \"unlimited vacation\" policies, which were all right for me - I probably averaged about four or five weeks off each year after they implemented the policy.  Some of the more experienced engineers were less fortunate and would only get one or two.  It's really a roll of the dice, but by removing a specific number, it can really hurt you.\r\n\r\nI was also in a two year training program before traveling where the pay was reduced.  Some of the rotations were not valuable and the training that was given was not extremely helpful at the time.  This program should be shortened - it already was reduced from two years to a year and a half, but I would recommend shortening it even more - beyond the fact that obtaining a six month lease is a logistical nightmare that.  A year for cultural indoctrination and training should be more than adequate.  The pay while in training is relatively low compared to what you could be makin elsewhere, but the workload is also quite low, so it's all fair."}, {"review_title": "Honeywell - Strong at the top and bottom, but weak in the middle", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Jul 2008", "job_title": "Principal Engineer in Des Plaines, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "100% employee match up to 8% of salary after one year of service for the 401.

Since the purchase by Honeywell, compensations, benefits, etc.. collapsed even further. Moreover, Honeywell  wants to apply thermostat-manufacturing by the thousands-type of mentality, to a customised EPC industry. It just doesn't make sense. From the inside, everything that was said in this site is quite spot on. The most disturbing would be to be dominated by the \"I've been here for 40 years so I know everything and everything I say is right compared to the stupid ideas you must have since you've been here for the past 10 years only\".

The level of respect for women at all levels has degraded noticeably in the US.

It''s tough to take - going to quarterly meetings where we hear how much money we're making, but then we can't afford raises.  \r\nThe other major con is the mass bureaucracy that I suppose may be typical at many large companies.  How many managers, project managers, asst project mangaers, project engineers, PP&C people, etc., do we need on a project.  It often seems like there's more managers than technical people working on a project.  And when you look at our org chart near the top, Honeywell has dozens of Presidents, hundreds, if not thousands, of Vice Presidents, and on and on.  Honeywell is a functional organization now, too, which means that HR only cares about HR, engineering only cares about engineering, project managers only care about that.  It results in constant top-down directives that do nothing to improve the product, customer experience, or working environment of employees.\r\n\r\nAs just a minor example of how this translates to my job, there's been a hard, hard cap on promotions above my current level since 2008.  Whereas before a decent engineer might've expected to make Principal Engineer by his mid-30s or certainly early 40s, now there is a hard cap that has no forseeable end date.  This is because one of the accountants running the show said \"Hey, we've got too many people at that level!\" and then just top-down dictated no more promotions.  They've gotten away with it because the economy's been so crappy that no one has wanted to leave.  But if things pick up, they'll have young people leaving.

Morale is pathetic.  Working for them is a huge risk with no long term guarantees.

My management would not pay for the training opportunities that were available to me because they believed their current practices were satisfactory - innovation and risk taking were discouraged and you would get a slap on the hand if you made recommendations to senior management.  Finally, unless you worked in Finance, management and HR were not interested in career planning or development.  I watched dozens of talented college graduates leave the company over my 6 years there to work for a different company that was actually invested in their employees and developing talent for long-term growth."}], [{"review_title": "High Employee Attrition.

Many employees are fascinated by aviation, have hobbies related to aviation and are generally very bright, hard working individuals.

Overall, here is a list of pros:\n\n- if you are on the right project (I.e. new development or research), the work is fascinating.\n- good opportunities for career growth and movement if you have signifiant talent (technical, management or project areas for engineering)\n- benefits are on par with other aerospace jobs. No pension for new hires and marginal health benefits but decent wages, 401k matching and some might like the negotiated vacation plan (you and your manager get to decide how many weeks of vacation you have each year)\n- Phoenix is a great city to live in if you are outdoorsy.

Rebellion of suppliers, huge issues of quality/delivery that are managed through heroic efforts by employees. Engineering is the current scapegoat (for a variety of complex reasons). Large portions of engineering is just focused on processes and manufacturing work-arounds, dogwork with very little innovation (many are reassessing their life priorities here)\n- focus on reducing engineering spend: very little research, plant closure rampant, shifting work to low cost regions at an increasing pace. All companies are doing this, but Honeywell is really starving engineering at a rate that is not comparable to other companies.\n- limited new product development: growth story from corporate disconnected from product ... Corp focused on software-industrial and connected which is generally inappropriate for aerospace since we don\u2019t sell to end consumer. Business unit leadership scared to provide candid feedback so we dilute scarce resources on low value mandates and have few real products in pipeline.\n- superficial employee engagement campaigns but gradual reduction in benefits, stagnant wages and expectations for mandatory overtime. It\u2019s feeling very much like \u201c1984\u201d with the propaganda vs reality.\n- High attrition from retirement and disillusioned new grads when faced with the above.\n\nI would generally tell prospective new employees to carefully examine the work opportunity & product growth plans and ask yourself \u201cwhat do I want to do with my career?\u201d  There are some good opportunities, but the environment is soul-sucking."}], [{"review_title": "Lots of challenge and variety but limited advancement opportunities", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Sept 2008", "job_title": "Senior Credit Analyst in Plymouth, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working for Honeywell Turbo Technologies provides the opportunity to learn a wide variety of concepts and to develop many different skills.

They made that clear when they hired me.  They asked me multiple times throughout the hiring process if I was aware that I was hiring for a full time travel position as if I had somehow forgotten.  I worked as a field engineer for a few years as one of their new university hires.  If you think that you would enjoy traveling the world and not having a home, I would recommend it, but do think carefully about it - I had studied abroad and traveled some before this, but it's not something to take lightly.  It can get quite lonely, and it also gets tiresome having so many trans-continental flights after awhile, but for the first year or two, it was quite a bit of fun.  I was fortunate to be able to travel with my wife after I got married, which was a nice benefit.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed being able to work with experts in different parts of the oil and gas sector at a very young age in my career, and though the learning curve is quite steep, it is manageable.  Just keep all your resources in hand, be willing to talk to your fellow field engineers and office staff, and you'll be all right.  As a young engineer, you'll be exposed to different ways of thinking, from the refiners that you work with to other areas of the oil and gas sector that you may be introduced to as well as within UOP.  It was a great introduction to being an engineer.  I was also pleased that I was able to work in many different parts of the oil and gas sector, from upstream to downstream, despite UOP having a reputation of predominantly being only a refining company.  I actually thoroughly enjoyed working in the upstream sector, which has a very different feel from refining.\r\n\r\nOnce you start traveling, the pay is quite good.  Prior to that, the salary is somewhat competitive, but nothing compared to say an entry engineer at a supermajor.  If you start working overseas, additional foreign bonus is applied on top of your salary, and if you are leading UOP's work overseas as a chief engineer, you also receive an additional bonus for that, as well as per diem.  Lump all this together and UOP's total compensation package is competitive with supermajor engineers.\r\n\r\nBoth a positive and negative was that I was able to see about a dozen countries on UOP's dime, which was a great experience, but it eventually became overwhelming having to take so many flights so frequently.  My last year, my longest job was only three weeks.  I really wanted to immerse myself in the local culture and learn the local languages, but it's hard to do that when you're only in a country for a few weeks.\r\n\r\nOne final point is that most of the old time engineers are very knowledgeable and personable, as well as a lot of the local engineers at the regional offices.  Everyone is very friendly and willing to help.  I really appreciated this, particularly while being so early in my career.   Every overseas office I went to was extremely friendly and tried to make me feel comfortable and well prepared for whatever job I came to do, which was great.", "cons": "Honeywell continues to clamp down on every aspect of the business, trying to suck UOP dry.  Cost cutting measures keep being aggressively put in place to limit spending with little regard for how this affects the quality of life of the field engineers.  Penny pinching over a few dollars a night spent at an extra hotel.  I was relatively fortunate with regards to this, but I know many who were not.\r\n\r\nUOP lies to its customers and bills them for business class travel and then gets only economy class travel.  I was only able to upgrade my travel to economy plus, and even then, only on long haul, 8+ hour flights, and not to continental Europe.  Doing these long haul flights two or three times a month like I was doing is not healthy or sustainable and was a serious factor in me leaving the company.  Business class would have made this much easier to deal with.  Beyond that, UOP makes you choose amongst the cheapest economy class flights, so frequently you are left with sub-optimal flight plans with nonsensical, excessive layovers and total flight time.\r\n\r\nPer diem is pitifully, hysterically low in the US at $35 per day.  This is completely absurd and should be updated to a reasonable amount.  The only way I was able to stay below per diem while working in the US was to stay at hotels where my wife and I could cook.\r\n\r\nSome engineers had the opposite problem that I did - they would wind up stuck in Southeast Asia for 14 months straight, while I was traveling from one site to another every two weeks.  Both are difficult and are possibilities that are outside of your control as a young field engineer.\r\n\r\nA lot of the engineers in the above situation also had issues getting time off.  I was fortunate with regards to this and never had much of an issue getting time off.  UOP and Honeywell have \"unlimited vacation\" policies, which were all right for me - I probably averaged about four or five weeks off each year after they implemented the policy.  Some of the more experienced engineers were less fortunate and would only get one or two.  It's really a roll of the dice, but by removing a specific number, it can really hurt you.\r\n\r\nI was also in a two year training program before traveling where the pay was reduced.  Some of the rotations were not valuable and the training that was given was not extremely helpful at the time.  This program should be shortened - it already was reduced from two years to a year and a half, but I would recommend shortening it even more - beyond the fact that obtaining a six month lease is a logistical nightmare that.  A year for cultural indoctrination and training should be more than adequate.  The pay while in training is relatively low compared to what you could be makin elsewhere, but the workload is also quite low, so it's all fair."}], [{"review_title": "Honeywell - Strong at the top and bottom, but weak in the middle", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Jul 2008", "job_title": "Principal Engineer in Tempe, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "100% employee match up to 8% of salary after one year of service for the 401.

Moreover, Honeywell  wants to apply thermostat-manufacturing by the thousands-type of mentality, to a customised EPC industry. It just doesn't make sense. From the inside, everything that was said in this site is quite spot on.

Most times, you loose interest in engineering, just like I did. The market doesn't need value your experience either, so you end up narrowing down your opportunities.\r\n- Pay is good, but you wouldn't see increments coming your way. Increments  are based neither on your diligent working nor on the quality work that you delivery consistently. They are entirely based on what the management calls \"progressive evaluation\", which only the management understands.\r\n-'Bond' will the protagonist to your story as well,  but only wish if it were as elegant as James Bond. You're put on the job with very little training, no on-field experience, no travel/training opportunities that you gain during your stay for the employee agreement to make any sense. I reckon, management uses it as a leverage to retain employees which is abysmal and unprofessional. To me, bond does not seem applicable to the college graduates, and they'll stand by the company through the thick and thin only if the management provides them with opportunities that graduates from the premier institutes of the country aspire for."}, {"review_title": "Amazing place for fresh graduates", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Sales Engineer (Fast Track Development Program) in Kuala Lumpur", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The company promotes independence, as well as self-motivation.

It''s tough to take - going to quarterly meetings where we hear how much money we're making, but then we can't afford raises.  \r\nThe other major con is the mass bureaucracy that I suppose may be typical at many large companies.  How many managers, project managers, asst project mangaers, project engineers, PP&C people, etc., do we need on a project.  It often seems like there's more managers than technical people working on a project.  And when you look at our org chart near the top, Honeywell has dozens of Presidents, hundreds, if not thousands, of Vice Presidents, and on and on.  Honeywell is a functional organization now, too, which means that HR only cares about HR, engineering only cares about engineering, project managers only care about that.  It results in constant top-down directives that do nothing to improve the product, customer experience, or working environment of employees.\r\n\r\nAs just a minor example of how this translates to my job, there's been a hard, hard cap on promotions above my current level since 2008.  Whereas before a decent engineer might've expected to make Principal Engineer by his mid-30s or certainly early 40s, now there is a hard cap that has no forseeable end date.  This is because one of the accountants running the show said \"Hey, we've got too many people at that level!\" and then just top-down dictated no more promotions.  They've gotten away with it because the economy's been so crappy that no one has wanted to leave.  But if things pick up, they'll have young people leaving.  Also, they've got a huge contingent of employees in their late 50s to early 60s who'll be retiring in the next 5-15 years.  Their solution is to hire Puerto Ricans, Czechs, and others overseas.  They are very penny-wise and pound-foolish on this and many, many other decisions.\r\n\r\nAlso, we have to pay a lot for our health insurance.
