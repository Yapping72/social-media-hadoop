		"pros": "Most people have heard the name, even if they don't know what sort of products or services are offered, therefore it looks better on a resume than less well known companies.",
		"cons": "1) Corporate greed runs rampant. One week they are sharing news of how well the company did last quarter and what great profits they had, and the next week they are sending out internal memos about spending and travel freezes so that we can perform to what the shareholders were promised. They always put the shareholders first, even when the actions to do so will negatively impact customers (many of the decrees are very short sighted). Customers come second and employees place last by a long shot. \r\n\r\n2) Honeywell buys well performing companies, takes their customer base, their IP, their suppliers, and anything else they can gut, and then outsources to the foreign country flavor of the month. If you work for a US based company that is bought by Honeywell, expect to see your job outsourced to China, Mexico, or India within 1-2 years. The outsourcing announcement was officially made at my company at the 1.5 yr mark, but the original plan began circling in upper levels of management around the 6 month mark, which is a pretty good indication that outsourcing was the plan from day 1. \r\n\r\n3) Honeywell is a \"check the box\" company. It does not matter if your actions produced valuable results, as much as it matters that you can say you did what the job required. On a regular basis, I see employees and leadership going through the motions to check the box, but not even caring about the outcome.\r\n\r\n4) Honeywell is so big that it is very common that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. It is pretty much a daily occurrence in some meeting or another.\r\n\r\n5) Honeywell invests massively into \"High Growth Regions\", which includes countries like China, India, and pretty much any country where employees are paid dirt. Yet, they have no respect for the American lives that they screw up when they lay off long-term employees in order to show headcount reductions. \r\n\r\n6) Top management makes millions of dollars per year, and yet the company \"struggles\" to do well in a tight economy, so it is most important that employees understand when the blue-collar and no-collar jobs need to be cut in order for the company to look good to investors."

Turnover in sales was particularly bad, as many people quickly realized that it's easier to win a prize at a rigged carnival game than it is to earn full sales commission at Honeywell.

While Honeywell's offer looked close to my previous employer's total compensation on paper, as the year wore on, had I not quit, my 2019 pay would have been nearly $45,000 lower than what I earned at my previous employer.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I learned the hard way that you can`t fix stupid.  Honeywell's workforce is rife with morons, nincompoops, and dumb-dumbs, which fosters a willpower and spirit depleting environment where it's just easier to be complicit in letting bad decisions pass along rather than push 20 boulders back up the mountain to fight it.

Too much emphasis on metrics (which are changed often) rather than the actual work that needs to be done. Production schedules are very unrealistic and do not take into account design flaws not anticipated before hitting the assembly floor. Some managers care about those that actually do the work while others (and supervisors) only care about \"making numbers\" to satisfy those above them. Corporate management pretends to care about employee welfare but don't show it in practice. Benefits reduced yearly and fair raises and bonuses non-existent. Way too many wasteful meetings throughout the plant for minor issues that result in little or no solutions! Too many of those in the meetings could solve most of the problems if they'd just spend more time on the floor. The ones at the lowest levels doing all the work (sacrificing home life) are not fairly compensated. Overall....the work enviroment is not a happy one, moralel there has dropped dramatically since the Honeywell take-over, and unless some drastic changes are made soon it'll only get worse. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I wish I could have had a more positive time with Honeywell but could not take the all the negative changes I was seeing, chose to leave for my own sanity! If you have any self worth and want to enjoy your chosen career consider other companies before signing on with this one!"

You may get laid off some day though. See my Layoffs comment under Cons.\r\n- Unless you\u2019re involved in one of the many \u201cfires\u201d, you are pretty much left alone to perform your task. This is opposed to some places that micromanage you and want to know how far along you are every few hours.\r\n- Despite the fact that management refuses to do what it takes to correct the site\u2019s issues or even accept that many of the issues exist, they seem to have a desire to correct the site\u2019s issues.",
		"cons": "- This is not a software engineering position. This is a programming position. Sadly, the unqualified employees don\u2019t seem to know the difference between the two.\r\n- Forget about promotion at this site, it is a dead end job. Due to a product that has been constantly losing millions every year, there is no budget for anything here. I've had to purchase my own office supplies.\r\n- No one learns from the past. Problems that threaten the product are never solved and you always encounter the same problems. \r\n- Due to decades of lay offs and people quitting, many of the longtime employees appear to have gotten positions for which they are not qualified. The result is an atmosphere where employees are solely concentrating on covering themselves, which means lots of announcing/highlighting another\u2019s mistakes and lots of bragging about their own accomplishments.\r\n- No understanding of the term \u201cwork/life balance\u201d. The culture here is that you are willing to work 24/7, you\u2019re on-call, and willing to give up your vacations for the company. The worst part is that the job ad and the information you get in the interview is that you will just need to put in a little of over-time around deadlines. The reality is far worse. Managers have actually stated (this is an exact quote): \u201cI don\u2019t care about people\u2019s weekends or vacations.\u201d In addition, as an engineer, you are expected to work at least a consistent 50 hours a week, even if you\u2019re getting pay for only 40 hours a week. This is all a result of too much work versus the available manpower.\r\n- Most of the programming work is done overseas. One thing this means is that you can expect the core of your job to be putting out the \u201cfire of the day\u201d. With whatever time you have left, you can then do some real programming. However, most of the good portions of software will be done overseas. This also means you\u2019ll need to get up early for those meetings with the overseas team.\r\n- Ridiculous deadlines. Take however long you think a software package will take, then divide that by three and that\u2019s your deadline. And it\u2019ll be expected you work nights, weekends, and delay vacation to make the deadline. Try to be clever and extend your estimate by a factor of three and managers will just submit a much lower estimate and then they\u2019ll divide that by three.\r\n-  Many employees and managers are condescending, unhelpful, and incompetent. The few competent employees seem to be constantly needing to work around the other employees. The general rule at this site is to help yourself first, and then if you have time, continue helping yourself, because other people don\u2019t matter.\r\n-  There seems to be a hire/layoff cycle here. Every few years there\u2019s another layoff after building up the number of employees.\r\n- There is a culture of \u201cyou\u2019ll do what we tell you\u201d. Forget about what they tell you in the job ad or the interview. As an employee at this site, it\u2019s expected you\u2019ll do whatever management says. If they need you to travel overseas, clean out some dark, forgotten, dust-buried corner of the site, or just work 100 hours a week, you\u2019re expected to do it, regardless of whether or not it\u2019s in your job description, part of your compensation package, or have a good reason for not being able to do it. Certainly, there are many small companies that expect you to \u201cwear many hats\u201d, but they usually state this at some point before you get hired. At this site, not only will they not mention it, they will be surprised when you explain to them that it needed to be mentioned.\r\n- Attention from management is used as a motivator. Most employees here are afraid of management, and many in management seem to encourage this view. This results in attention being used as a motivator during \u201cfires\u201d.\r\n- Most management openly do not care about their employees. Managers have actually said \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d toward their employee's special family events. Certainly, at the very least, there are better ways to respond to an employee in that situation.\r\n- No where to get information for your task. The only time you can get information on your task is when it is due. There is a \u201cjust figure it out\u201d attitude here. Then, when it\u2019s due, employees will seemingly come out of no where to give you a list of things you\u2019re software package should do, but doesn\u2019t. As a result, there\u2019s a lot of software here that does not work like it should. Rewrites happen more often than it should\r\n- Management seems to enjoy lateness. Management will act extremely slow in making decisions in a project until very late in the life-cycle, only to result in a \u201cHerculean effort\u201d to get the project done. It\u2019s not clear if management enjoys the adrenaline rush of being late, or fears making decisions.\r\n- No tools. The system you work on can be described as a complex, distributed system. As such, you really need tools to troubleshoot it. Not only are there very few tools (and those tools are poor), there is not even any recognition of a need for tools. If you want to work quickly and efficiently via great tools, be prepared to not only make your own tools, but to do it on your own time. \r\n- Very little praise for anything you do. At this site, software engineers are not looked at as part of the solution, we are part of the problem. Since management has very little understanding of software, and even less interest in attempting to understand software, software is looked at as something easy and quick to complete. \r\n- Multiple people seem intent on driving the site into a direction of their own choosing, aka have their own agendas. This results in people going behind you to sabotage your efforts if they don\u2019t agree with them.  \r\n- To stay at this position, you\u2019ll need to learn to love frustration. Frustration seems quite consistent among most employees. It's just extremely difficult to get anything done and meanwhile there are strict deadlines."

		"cons": "Where to start...don't be fooled, darius is dave's clone without a personality (which can be pos or neg depending on your point of view). Other than the very small  bubble I am currently in, what I see going on around me is appalling. The last 5-6 years have been a rapidly accelerating descent through chaos into indifference.  Read the other reviews for details, what they describe is spot on. Don't be fooled by the company sponsored 4-5 star 1-2 sentence reviews that are probably required in bulk of HR minions so they can be promoted. The best employees are loaded up to the point of collapse/quitting as they try to keep things afloat with no support from their managers, the best of whom are also overloaded and completely hamstrung by upper management's greed for ever larger bonuses. The company is being hollowed out by upper management skimming off the top while the employees doing the work get less and less for their efforts. When management states there is 'really no way to measure customer satisfaction' you are forced to realize just how deep the hole you are in really is. And in spite of everything they won't stop digging; they dig faster and harder."

There is actually a large department at corporate that is dedicated to processing layoffs and there have been so many layoffs that there are not enough people to deliver product to the customer (there are major product quality issues and most products are delivered late).\r\nLow pay scales, no merit pay raises (for the past 6 years), no bonus pay (for the past 2 years), annual pay cuts (typically 10%), and horrible benefits (high premiums; dental benefits completely cut).\r\nLow morale due to continuous layoffs, horrible management, and poor financial metrics (employees don't understand how the company reports record growth/profits to investors, but internally employees hear that revenue is down across all divisions).\r\nManagement lacks integrity, ethics, and accountability (corporate lawyers make decisions based on \"We don't think we will get caught\").  There are major violations of federal law that could potentially bar the company from business.\r\nVery few opportunities for employee training or career development.  No career advancement opportunities.\r\n\"Honeywell Operating System\" (HOS) is ridiculous - it is simply standard work that the company should already do.\r\nDeclining company reputation makes it extremely difficult to recruit talent.  I had several open reqs and only ~10 applicants over 6 months for each one; every applicant asked me about the company's poor reviews and reputation."

If you are an SBG employee or corporate, its worse, everyone in the SBU's and GBE's hate you and want you to fail. Worse still the SBU's and GBE's have all the information you need for your job and are located all over the world in different time zones. For goals, you are essentially given pie in the sky targets like grow revenue by 5%, margin by 3% etc. Of course you have no authority to change anything nor are you given a team. A title and a laptop are all that you have. Next is your boss, most likely a foreigner or someone from management consulting. If its a foreigner, he is most likely a racist that has never faced an employment lawsuit for abuse. Get ready to be yelled at, cursed at, told you know nothing and get abused for your e-mails not being grammatically correct. You can't impress your boss with any accomplishments, all he cares about are power point presentations. He will use your presentations to look good in front of his boss. You will not have access to any data or systems, trying to get access will send you in a loop to India and back to the US with no result. Forget all your skills learnt previously, they are useless. Everything revolves around meetings and presentations. You are expected to know things about every business automatically. Every meeting feels like a quiz where you are asked detailed questions about some business process on some line of business in Europe. You will not know the answer and your boss won't either, but he will expect you to find out. Unfortunately no one in Europe will respond to you with information, or will send you some canned nonsense.I can go on and on, but its better to do the smart thing and jump ship like so many have done in 2019"

		"cons": "The benefits are a joke- the healthcare is astronomically expensive and there's no company match.\r\nIt takes years before you get any additional vacation time added (5 years until you get an additional week) and you never get additional PTO. \r\nThe work/ life balance at Honeywell is deplorable and that's attributed to the austerity measures put in by the top brass (CEO - Cote) a couple years ago, plus bad planning all the way down the leadership chain - in all business units. Simply put, if you work here you're just a number; a metric, not a person with a life outside Honeywell. And this company will work you until they either break you or lay you off. There are better and more stable engineering companies out there.\r\nVery little development or promotional opportunities unless you're in the senior, upper leadership. I rarely see regular engineers/ managers promoted to the next level in any SBU.\r\nHoneywell is a very bloated company. There are metrics and more metrics and so many processes we have to go through to get simple things done (ordering software, refreshing computers, office supplies, etc) that we waste a lot of our time just trying to accomplish basic tasks when we could be doing science."

		"cons": "There are absolutely no perks to working for this company.  Many people that work there, you can see it in their eyes that they died  inside a long time ago and are just going through the daily motions. The building is old and decrepit, and in a small, difficult to get to town in Southern Germany. If you spend more than 10 Euros a day on food while travelling, you will get asked by your manager to explain yourself. The company is INCREDIBLY cheap when it comes to travel. If you take a taxi somewhere, i.e. to get dinner, etc, expect to have to explain yourself to an angry manager yelling at you for \"wasting the company's money\".   Management initially expected me to drive 5 hours starting at 4am, so I could be at a day long meeting at 9am to save the cost of a night at a hotel. I refused.  Management is also extremely micro-managerial.  Even when you are in training and not doing much in the way of actually dealing with accounts or visiting clients or talking to anyone yet, expect to have to send multiple daily fluff emails to your manager to keep them satisfied.  Also, the training is TERRIBLE. I was a sales account manager, and the training I was given was days long, and designed for an installation technician, not a member of the sales team. It was absolutely useless and covered nothing about value proposition, the competition, features, benefits, etc. You know, the useful stuff a sales person might need to know in order to sell a product. It seemed like they really had no plan and no direct sales experience.  There was also no lead generation mechanism, or Business development department. You are expected to cold call giant international Fortune 500 corporations...in Germany.  Good luck with that!  2 weeks into working for Honeywell, I already hated it and regretted accepting their offer. 4 weeks into it, I had already made up my mind to quit and started sending out new resumes, and by week 6, before I had even gotten my ears wet, and just as I was finishing \"training\", I simply couldn't take it any more.  Other members of my team ( who started when I did, and who I became good friends with) had similar misgivings. Time will tell how long they'll last there. I suspect not very long. I have NEVER worked at a company that I hated so much, so quickly. This was the shortest job I ever had and it felt like a piano had been lifted off my shoulder when I left. Honeyhell is a giant, soul sucking bureaucratic, American corporate hellscape."

No regard for Technical competence, expertise, loyalty, track-record or experience. \r\n\r\nYou need to be a YES (WO)/Man. Middle management seems toothless and powerless......the grape wine is that it seems they need 'permissions' for breathing also.\r\n\r\nSenior leadership seems absolutely clueless......they just seem to parrot words fed to them by Honeywell Top leadership. every message has to have the name of the Honeywell CEO mentioned........to 'enforce' action. \r\n\r\nMost of the VP'S have no operational understanding or experience of the businesses they are running..... have arrived for their corporate honeymoon with pre-listed cost-cutting objectives, from parent Honeywell. \r\n\r\nAn entire team of wishful thinkers is sitting in the HO spinning webs of stories (that Honeywell likes to listen to) without engaging with the ground. ear to the ground is MUTED- your opinion is 'rubbish' if it does not align with the top. \r\n\r\nNo one wants to hear a 'NO'. it seems that even the customer is not allowed to say 'NO'- however genuine their concern.\r\n \r\nThe company has, over last 7 years seen a very profitable run, with every year seeing a record of sorts...... in spite of this, raises are minimal or none followed by repeated rounds of LAY-OFFS and Furloughs 'enforced' to please the ''INVESTOR''."

		"cons": "Used to be technology and inovation leader., but is now a very poor also ran. Investment decisions have diverted money away from real product development. Honeywell now exists by buying other companies and stripping them.\r\n\r\nHoneywell's best engineers now work for a company started by former Honeywell employees. That company has taken Honewyell's 90% market share, has taken most of Honeywell's engineers and is now THE leading supplier in the market segment.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely zero opportuities for advancement. I have been told on 3 separate occassions that I would not be considered for a job in the US because tHonewyell was not prepared to bring someone from offshore\r\n\r\nPerformance reviews and recognition are a very poor joke. I have been personally told that senior management downgraded the review given by my manager, in order to meet a quota and avoid giving me a pay increase\r\n\r\nSalaries have been frozen for 3 years\r\n\r\nWe took a mandated pay cut this year but managers still expected us to work the same overtime and weekend hours over and above a 40 hour week.\r\n\r\nThey have forgotten how to look after the cusomers. 4 years ago I had a travel budget of $125,000 to visit the customers and resolve their problems. My budget this year, to do the same job, is $12,000.\r\n\r\nManagers are fascinated with surveys, and use them to get the ratings they want, rather than recognizing the genuine customer concerns expressed in surveys. I have personally had managers tell me that they ignored certain well respected industry surveys becasue they were negative.\r\n\r\nDownsizing has been the constant theme since the Allied Signal acquisition.\r\n\r\nGives lip service to training but in reality does not provide it. I have had to go troubleshoot completely new systems with zero product training prior to seeing the system on the aircraft.\r\n\r\nManagement philosophy is to try to imitate GE. They have not succeeded.\r\n\r\nOver the last ten years I have watched a $300M business unit become a $30M business unit, while the stock price has been protected by cost cutting. There is nothing left for the future."

Honeywell essentially buys smaller companies and lets them run, so as a designer you can step in and help them build better products and experiences.",
		"cons": "The industrial design management is horrific and created a toxic work environment. ID management's style is essentially a bat about the head and neck. ID management uses verbal abuse as the primary management tool, followed up by tirades and berating language. ID management lies about what is expected from you, making things like deliverables change from day to day. ID management has unrealistic and hidden expectations about how design and designers should work, and uses that against the designers. ID management takes no responsibility for anything as far as I could tell.\r\nHere is an example: I met ID management at one of the Honeywell subsidiaries in the  suburbs of a major midwestern city for a kick off meeting around designing new fire control systems. This is a typical product development meeting, where the designers meet with engineers to understand technical limitations (manufacturing electronics etc) and meet with product management, who own the business side of the products (what it needs to do, and cost and who its for). These meetings are what they sound like, a kick off- a chance to meet your product development partners and get on the same page. Designers typically leave these meetings and put plans to gather for the project; schedule, process resources etc.\r\nI walked into this facility and ID management pulled me aside immediately into an empty office and began dressing me down about why I had not brought a presentation to show these people. I was horrified that I had missed this assignment and had no idea what ID management was referring to- it was a kick off meeting, we were there to learn.  Then it became apparent this was one more wacky mind game. As I caught myself I realized no one even asked me if I had a presentation, ID management just laid into me for NOT having a presentation.\r\nThat is the type of mind games I constantly endured at Honeywell, and the type of behavior Honeywell believes makes them successful.\r\n As a designer please stay away. It is a stifling and crushing creative environment. ID management is doing nothing that remotely looks like it's heading Honeywell toward the 'Apple of the Industrials'.\r\nIn short its the worst job I have EVER had in my life. And I have had some lame jobs."

They just make sure you do and follow the useless stuff where there is no positive outcome.\r\n6. Salary hikes - you need not to ask about this, when the management is only worried about cost savings and productivity savings , they don't even bother if you ask also. When you do it's the high time for an individual to look outside before they terminates you by deploying unnecessary reasons.\r\n7.

As they are the most useless and stupid policies they follow.\r\n7. Never ever think about fun activities or any kind of outing, as you would be questioned on the business targets and progress and you actually land up in having productivity savings that they use for those activities.\r\nPSE function don't like to spend INR 252 rs. from business fund for snacks for any of the fun event and ask the management on cost revision for that financial year.\r\n8. Don't think about the individual growth as the management is only worried about monthly and yearly goals and how to achieve those Savings by setting the high targets which are impossible to achieve.\r\n9. You feel like working in a kingdom type or in a school. Every manager thinks that they are dictators and deploy business strategies and principles in the same way.

Additionally, employees are not given proper access to resources, time, and training in order to meet specific goals.  Certain initiatives (relating to order policy, dock/reciepts scheduling, etc) actually make goals more difficult to achieve.  All employees have same goals (cut & paste template flowed down to all) in Performance Tracking system.  \r\n\r\n- Honeywell corporate focuses on 40 hours mandatory training per year in their recruiting process.  However, Aerospace does not support employee development/training, especially in hard financial times or end-of-year timeframe.   The Six Sigma Certification is more a \"degree mill\" than learning process resulting in tangible process improvements.  Teams have been certified in less than 1 week when in actuality a Green Belt/Six Sigma project should takes several weeks.\r\n\r\n- employee morale very low.  Management experiences high turnover in terms of people & initiatives/policies.  \r\n\r\n- Increase in salary is based upon your relationship with management (who you know) & roles changes, not so much excelling in one's current position.  Most do not stay in a role more than 18 months (little personal or financial incentive to do so).  This results in little positive impact to the business - the employee learns the job and leaves for another job and bump in pay.\r\n\r\n- extreme fear of layoffs as sourcing, production & support acitivity is phased out to low-cost regions abroad.\r\n\r\n- Changes in health care policy to \"encourage\" voluntary retirement viewed as unethical by some emloyees further decreasing employee morale and loyality.\r\n\r\n- Top executive bonuses do not match pay cuts inflicted upon employees actually performing the work which keeps parts moving & customers satisfied."

As many companies in the USA have already outsourced their operations and manufacturing, it is very hard to find jobs that can offer you technical on-hands development, except for Apple, Google, Samsung, and the big competitive ones... \r\nBut, that was in the past as Honeywell current direction is to go to ODM and third party manufacturing nowadays...",
		"cons": "There is no culture in this place. People do not have sense or urgency, no sense of ownership, no sense of belonging. No training offered: no courses in finance or in life, no nothing that can help you improve as a person. There are some sexual harassment in workplace and some adultery, where there are people sleeping with others. There are people who are aware of this too. There are people who drink alcohol in the job and do not get reprimanded. It seems there is no strong HR policies enforcement in place.   \r\n\r\nThere are people who have been here for 30+ years. They are slow and hard to deal with. They are not used to changes nor to adapt things to current situations. All they do is to let thing sit, whine, and perish. They always do things in a certain way. When new product was introduced they didn't know what to do and didn't want to think outside the box in figuring out other quality measurements and tests, but complained: \"we used to do it in this way and what is wrong in doing it in the same way that we have been doing it for the past 20 years\". Did you just hear what you just said?! The customer behavior changed, the product changed, if you test it in the same way as the past 20 years then your test result will fail! \r\n\r\nThere are individuals that had been there for ~40 years or more, they don't do anything but to sleep on the job. When issue come, they hide inside a locked room and blames the factory for unfinished and not working setups. They intentionally come to work at 630am in the morning to pretend to work and so that nobody is at work and they don't have to work at all, and leave work at 230pm. This way the working time is the least possible overlapping with other people's working time. This is really smart. \r\n\r\nThere are people that go to Mexico often, but don't know how to lean the process to deal with Mexico. Their suggestions conflict with the response from Mexico departments. They are unable to solve issues with regards to Mexico, unable to optimize the operations with Mexico, and are stuck with the same ECN process, and assume the process is fine and properly working. Another expired resource stuck in the times of the past... \r\n\r\nThere are people who seem to only know how to manage toolings. They don't seem to be kind in learning other skills or other tasks. They are always walking around in the halls, would look at any excuse to have a long conversation. The conversation could last for 20-30 minutes about fishing. Instead of finding ways to resolve issues or help you to find solutions, they would rather chat until you forget what the issues were and walk away. Other people find excuses to not work and walk away as if nothing happened... \r\n \r\nThe right hand does not know what the left hand is doing, and viceversa.  Whatever optimization a group is doing then it will definitely affect other groups and the same applies for other group. Groups are working in silo and there is no clear sense of direction as a company and no communication in between. Groups are not involved in design and there seems to be no management guidance in the company.\r\n\r\nSourcing in Mexico is a mess. They cannot do anything and they are mostly bound with agreements with vendors. They are non responsive. As they do not respond to your emails. They cannot get their job done properly. And someone from another team/division has to  fill in for their shoes and do their job properly. \r\n\r\nMexico factory is a mess. They do not respond to your email. By the time they respond to your email the person that was in charge has already left the job. The turnover rate in Mexico is very big. There is always a new person in charge every two months. They are not responsive and not responsible. You get lots of headache dealing with them on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nThere is no work from home policy. Or very few access to work from home. Guys, it is modern times, other companies are offering work from home policies because it improves work life balance. This division does not offer work from home to majority because they consider it as an additional expenses of $3/month per people. This is nothing compared to the boost in performance that you get from people. \r\n\r\nThe laptops they provide are bulky and heavy. Not really portable. \r\n\r\nCoffee machines are old and obsolete. It takes them forever to warm water and they are noisy and slow. The coffee beans used taste bad and they don't change them for better one. It seems that they are lazy to improve the coffee beans or order the cheapest coffee beans. Some of them are nest of cockroaches, extra flavor for you!\r\n\r\nBenefits keep on going down year by year. Honeywell health policy states to penalize people based on BMI. If your BMI is outside your range then you get penalized by $500. If your BMI does not improve but degrades with respect to last year's then you get penalized by additional $500. This policy shouldn't be legal, but apparently it is legal. Instead of penalizing the worker by such policies, it should encourage instead by providing games with fitbit and apple watches that give bonuses and activities to improve health like other companies are curretly doing. But, Honeywell chooses the negative action instead... Another benefit are the unwanted furlough that they provide you when the sales are down. I would prefer layoff than this so that you can inject new energy and new blood into the culture or to develop a culture, if there is one left... \r\n\r\nHoneywell implemented unlimited vacations starting 2018. But this is at the discretion of the manager. The policy is quote on quote \"unlimited\" to attract applicants, but in reality it is not widely implemented. Honeywell does not follow the honor system nor plan to implement such policy. However, this unlimited vacation is good for Honeywell in terms of layoffs and quitting because Honeywell no longer needs to compensate the extra time to their ex-workers. Do not think that an old conglomerate will be able to easily adapt to the current work policies. This company is old and will always be old to adapt to current times.  \r\n\r\nThere are many more issues in this division that I am not going to mention anymore because the list can get pretty long and I am tired of writing as well. There are lots of issues, lots of them... If you can choose NOT to work for this company, then please do so, I'd definitely recommend you to work at somewhere else that gives you better benefits and are better company than this one. It is NOT worth it to have Honeywell in your resume. The CONS are greater than the PROS... Take my advise for it!\r\n\r\nHoneywell is too big and has too many divisions, too many products that sell at high  volume, and brand name. That's why this company can still survive with an internal mess. They do not care as little to some income keeps on pouring in. And when divisions do not work, then they sell it off or spin it off. Kudos to management!"

		"cons": "Anecdote: Upper management recognizes benefits of morale. Middle management then tasked with setting standard to measure morale - employees caring enough about the company to submit their own ideas for \"continuous improvements\" (CI's). Lower management is tasked with achieving measurable morale in the form of the volume of CI's - two a month. Bottom management puts a gun to each employee's head and tells them they'd better turn in 2 CI's a month or it'll go in their next performance review making them vulnerable the next time they have layoffs. Employees reluctantly turn in any CI's that'll give them two a month, including things like \"found pen on floor, picked it up\". Upper management sees numbers and thinks morale goals have been met, avalanche of mostly-worthless CI's waste several people's time, and employee morale couldn't be worse. This pretty much sums up everything Honeywell does.\r\n\r\nSafety: Safety SEEMS to be a MAJOR concern for Honeywell! ... unless it's too inconvenient or expensive, then hell with ya. HSE's goal is not to keep the employees safe, but to reduce Honeywell's liability.\r\n\r\nPay: Rates have been frozen for well over a decade. After 8 years I was still making only 76% of the industry's standard for STARTING pay in the same job.\r\n\r\nPeople: Most co-workers are hard-working and friendly people. Team Leads are too often unqualified simpletons with too much liability and not enough authority. Supervisors stay in their offices and don't want to be bothered with any of that work-related stuff. Upper management are usually polite but clueless. They set impossible standards based on BS numbers and the production floor creates more BS to look like they achieved it.\r\n\r\nAdvancement: None. Seriously, not a chance in hell.\r\n\r\nI have never in my life worked for a company that has so perfectly represented the stereotypes of corporate bureaucracy. I don't know of anyone who works there that wants to, but they're the biggest employer in the area."

Especially at salary review time, but not so much when talking about corporate profits or the bonus being given the CEO.\r\nLeadership was sorely lacking at the site and there seemed to be no big picture plan. When management was told by professionals that managers were not listening, an additional dozen or so managers were hired from internal personnel.  Actually most of the people who weren't listening were promoted.  Don't even attempt to try to tell your immediate supervisor, much less management, that they might be doing something wrong or incorrectly, and that there might be a better way to get things done. Big on 'people are our most important asset', but a lot of lip service and little action. To contrast, there were people being treated rather well.  Must be some method to the madness. The culture seemed strange at this location in promoting managers who were not getting the job done.  Expect to be like any other company - management wants you to do everything and help them to continually improve - constantly preaching change and yet fighting it every step of the way to eventual contract loss."

Since the new leadership has taken over, there has been a consistent effort to single handedly take ridiculous steps to curtail benefits and change policies all in the name of savings. They advertise about the company being \u2018One Honeywell\u2019 and there being nothing like HTS India or Honeywell International but the truth is that HTS India employees are now treated as these cheap cost animals that are available to grind. Their travel policies are extremely biased towards them. Your managers will ask you to travel for 28 days to US and the policy is such that you don\u2019t get one rupee extra for having lived away from your family. The make reimbursements on actuals for up to 30 days. But then your on-site stakeholder says can you please extend your stay beyond 30 days. You extend and you\u2019ll never get paid per diem because your original travel was planned for 30 days. It is disgusting. \n\nThe new leadership feels they are tightening these policies and getting great margins but there\u2019s been a steady talent drain from Honeywell and most managers will agree to this in private. This will eventually drive the innovation to ground. \nRecently they have started playing a new tune \u201cTHERE WILL BE RECESSION SO WE NEED TO BE READY\u201d this is yet another effort to squeeze the employee benefits to drive cost savings. \n\nThe work itself is structured in a way that most of your counterparts would be based on US. So everyday evening is work evening and you are expected to take calls and attend meetings. On being asked if all the work happens in evenings then whys that we still follow IST morning to evening times and why not have 1400HRS to 2300HRS shifts like rest of the US overlapping companies do and some other teams in Honeywell itself do, people were told that it was not required since everyone had laptops and they can work from home (note that internet is not paid for by company). It is obvious that this is to avoid additional shift allowance and transportation cost liability. This practice ensures that employee is in work mode from 800hrs in morning to 2300hrs in evening everyday. Call it an air conditioned sweatshop."

Trainings - they promote people but do not have time to invest with the necessary skills  training set to impart those who've been promoted. At least an essential one, basics like \n1.  Leadership Development Programs\n2.  People Management / People handling\n\nFor normal people like us, training are ONLY VISUAL boring.  No time for room trainings \n\n5.

		"pros": "Most people have heard the name, even if they don't know what sort of products or services are offered, therefore it looks better on a resume than less well known companies.",
		"cons": "1) Corporate greed runs rampant. One week they are sharing news of how well the company did last quarter and what great profits they had, and the next week they are sending out internal memos about spending and travel freezes so that we can perform to what the shareholders were promised. They always put the shareholders first, even when the actions to do so will negatively impact customers (many of the decrees are very short sighted). Customers come second and employees place last by a long shot. \r\n\r\n2) Honeywell buys well performing companies, takes their customer base, their IP, their suppliers, and anything else they can gut, and then outsources to the foreign country flavor of the month. If you work for a US based company that is bought by Honeywell, expect to see your job outsourced to China, Mexico, or India within 1-2 years. The outsourcing announcement was officially made at my company at the 1.5 yr mark, but the original plan began circling in upper levels of management around the 6 month mark, which is a pretty good indication that outsourcing was the plan from day 1. \r\n\r\n3) Honeywell is a \"check the box\" company. It does not matter if your actions produced valuable results, as much as it matters that you can say you did what the job required. On a regular basis, I see employees and leadership going through the motions to check the box, but not even caring about the outcome.\r\n\r\n4) Honeywell is so big that it is very common that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. It is pretty much a daily occurrence in some meeting or another.\r\n\r\n5) Honeywell invests massively into \"High Growth Regions\", which includes countries like China, India, and pretty much any country where employees are paid dirt. Yet, they have no respect for the American lives that they screw up when they lay off long-term employees in order to show headcount reductions. \r\n\r\n6) Top management makes millions of dollars per year, and yet the company \"struggles\" to do well in a tight economy, so it is most important that employees understand when the blue-collar and no-collar jobs need to be cut in order for the company to look good to investors."

Too much emphasis on metrics (which are changed often) rather than the actual work that needs to be done.

Some managers care about those that actually do the work while others (and supervisors) only care about \"making numbers\" to satisfy those above them. Corporate management pretends to care about employee welfare but don't show it in practice. Benefits reduced yearly and fair raises and bonuses non-existent. Way too many wasteful meetings throughout the plant for minor issues that result in little or no solutions! Too many of those in the meetings could solve most of the problems if they'd just spend more time on the floor. The ones at the lowest levels doing all the work (sacrificing home life) are not fairly compensated. Overall....the work enviroment is not a happy one, moralel there has dropped dramatically since the Honeywell take-over, and unless some drastic changes are made soon it'll only get worse. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I wish I could have had a more positive time with Honeywell but could not take the all the negative changes I was seeing, chose to leave for my own sanity!

		"job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Sarasota, FL",
		"duration": "N/A",
		"pros": "- You get a regular paycheck.\r\n- Sarasota, FL is a beautiful, peaceful city.\r\n- If you hate to learn new technologies or the latest software engineering methodologies, this is the place for you. With few exceptions, the culture at this site is to try to keep the state of software development like it was 20 years ago. This is because the current staff has little interest in learning new skills.\r\n- If you are looking to manufacture a situation where you can sue the company for which you work, there is a decent chance of achieving that here. Some managers constantly make really inappropriate comments.\r\n- You want to work somewhere that you can pretty much do what you want with impunity and no fear of getting fired. You may get laid off some day though. See my Layoffs comment under Cons.\r\n- Unless you\u2019re involved in one of the many \u201cfires\u201d, you are pretty much left alone to perform your task. This is opposed to some places that micromanage you and want to know how far along you are every few hours.\r\n- Despite the fact that management refuses to do what it takes to correct the site\u2019s issues or even accept that many of the issues exist, they seem to have a desire to correct the site\u2019s issues.",
		"cons": "- This is not a software engineering position. This is a programming position. Sadly, the unqualified employees don\u2019t seem to know the difference between the two.\r\n- Forget about promotion at this site, it is a dead end job. Due to a product that has been constantly losing millions every year, there is no budget for anything here. I've had to purchase my own office supplies.\r\n- No one learns from the past. Problems that threaten the product are never solved and you always encounter the same problems. \r\n- Due to decades of lay offs and people quitting, many of the longtime employees appear to have gotten positions for which they are not qualified. The result is an atmosphere where employees are solely concentrating on covering themselves, which means lots of announcing/highlighting another\u2019s mistakes and lots of bragging about their own accomplishments.\r\n- No understanding of the term \u201cwork/life balance\u201d. The culture here is that you are willing to work 24/7, you\u2019re on-call, and willing to give up your vacations for the company. The worst part is that the job ad and the information you get in the interview is that you will just need to put in a little of over-time around deadlines. The reality is far worse. Managers have actually stated (this is an exact quote): \u201cI don\u2019t care about people\u2019s weekends or vacations.\u201d In addition, as an engineer, you are expected to work at least a consistent 50 hours a week, even if you\u2019re getting pay for only 40 hours a week. This is all a result of too much work versus the available manpower.\r\n- Most of the programming work is done overseas. One thing this means is that you can expect the core of your job to be putting out the \u201cfire of the day\u201d. With whatever time you have left, you can then do some real programming. However, most of the good portions of software will be done overseas. This also means you\u2019ll need to get up early for those meetings with the overseas team.\r\n- Ridiculous deadlines. Take however long you think a software package will take, then divide that by three and that\u2019s your deadline. And it\u2019ll be expected you work nights, weekends, and delay vacation to make the deadline. Try to be clever and extend your estimate by a factor of three and managers will just submit a much lower estimate and then they\u2019ll divide that by three.\r\n-  Many employees and managers are condescending, unhelpful, and incompetent. The few competent employees seem to be constantly needing to work around the other employees. The general rule at this site is to help yourself first, and then if you have time, continue helping yourself, because other people don\u2019t matter.\r\n-  There seems to be a hire/layoff cycle here. Every few years there\u2019s another layoff after building up the number of employees.\r\n- There is a culture of \u201cyou\u2019ll do what we tell you\u201d. Forget about what they tell you in the job ad or the interview. As an employee at this site, it\u2019s expected you\u2019ll do whatever management says. If they need you to travel overseas, clean out some dark, forgotten, dust-buried corner of the site, or just work 100 hours a week, you\u2019re expected to do it, regardless of whether or not it\u2019s in your job description, part of your compensation package, or have a good reason for not being able to do it. Certainly, there are many small companies that expect you to \u201cwear many hats\u201d, but they usually state this at some point before you get hired. At this site, not only will they not mention it, they will be surprised when you explain to them that it needed to be mentioned.\r\n- Attention from management is used as a motivator. Most employees here are afraid of management, and many in management seem to encourage this view. This results in attention being used as a motivator during \u201cfires\u201d.\r\n- Most management openly do not care about their employees. Managers have actually said \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d toward their employee's special family events. Certainly, at the very least, there are better ways to respond to an employee in that situation.\r\n- No where to get information for your task. The only time you can get information on your task is when it is due. There is a \u201cjust figure it out\u201d attitude here. Then, when it\u2019s due, employees will seemingly come out of no where to give you a list of things you\u2019re software package should do, but doesn\u2019t. As a result, there\u2019s a lot of software here that does not work like it should. Rewrites happen more often than it should\r\n- Management seems to enjoy lateness. Management will act extremely slow in making decisions in a project until very late in the life-cycle, only to result in a \u201cHerculean effort\u201d to get the project done. It\u2019s not clear if management enjoys the adrenaline rush of being late, or fears making decisions.\r\n- No tools. The system you work on can be described as a complex, distributed system. As such, you really need tools to troubleshoot it. Not only are there very few tools (and those tools are poor), there is not even any recognition of a need for tools. If you want to work quickly and efficiently via great tools, be prepared to not only make your own tools, but to do it on your own time. \r\n- Very little praise for anything you do. At this site, software engineers are not looked at as part of the solution, we are part of the problem. Since management has very little understanding of software, and even less interest in attempting to understand software, software is looked at as something easy and quick to complete. \r\n- Multiple people seem intent on driving the site into a direction of their own choosing, aka have their own agendas. This results in people going behind you to sabotage your efforts if they don\u2019t agree with them.  \r\n- To stay at this position, you\u2019ll need to learn to love frustration. Frustration seems quite consistent among most employees. It's just extremely difficult to get anything done and meanwhile there are strict deadlines."

Upper management would get rid of him if they knew what he was doing for us as it goes against the one and only commandment of \"Thou Shalt Cut Costs At All Cost!.\" None of the other managers I have had in the last 15 years had the stones to even try to explain what it really takes to get promoted in this environment. Just promote the ones you like. Most didn't even understand our group's true function, and considered all of us unpromotable because 'you only do ...'

Other than the very small  bubble I am currently in, what I see going on around me is appalling. The last 5-6 years have been a rapidly accelerating descent through chaos into indifference.  Read the other reviews for details, what they describe is spot on. Don't be fooled by the company sponsored 4-5 star 1-2 sentence reviews that are probably required in bulk of HR minions so they can be promoted. The best employees are loaded up to the point of collapse/quitting as they try to keep things afloat with no support from their managers, the best of whom are also overloaded and completely hamstrung by upper management's greed for ever larger bonuses. The company is being hollowed out by upper management skimming off the top while the employees doing the work get less and less for their efforts. When management states there is 'really no way to measure customer satisfaction' you are forced to realize just how deep the hole you are in really is. And in spite of everything they won't stop digging; they dig faster and harder."

There is actually a large department at corporate that is dedicated to processing layoffs and there have been so many layoffs that there are not enough people to deliver product to the customer (there are major product quality issues and most products are delivered late).\r\nLow pay scales, no merit pay raises (for the past 6 years), no bonus pay (for the past 2 years), annual pay cuts (typically 10%), and horrible benefits (high premiums; dental benefits completely cut).\r\nLow morale due to continuous layoffs, horrible management, and poor financial metrics (employees don't understand how the company reports record growth/profits to investors, but internally employees hear that revenue is down across all divisions).\r\nManagement lacks integrity, ethics, and accountability (corporate lawyers make decisions based on \"We don't think we will get caught\").  There are major violations of federal law that could potentially bar the company from business.\r\nVery few opportunities for employee training or career development.  No career advancement opportunities.\r\n\"Honeywell Operating System\" (HOS) is ridiculous - it is simply standard work that the company should already do.\r\nDeclining company reputation makes it extremely difficult to recruit talent.  I had several open reqs and only ~10 applicants over 6 months for each one; every applicant asked me about the company's poor reviews and reputation."

If you are an SBG employee or corporate, its worse, everyone in the SBU's and GBE's hate you and want you to fail. Worse still the SBU's and GBE's have all the information you need for your job and are located all over the world in different time zones. For goals, you are essentially given pie in the sky targets like grow revenue by 5%, margin by 3% etc. Of course you have no authority to change anything nor are you given a team. A title and a laptop are all that you have. Next is your boss, most likely a foreigner or someone from management consulting. If its a foreigner, he is most likely a racist that has never faced an employment lawsuit for abuse. Get ready to be yelled at, cursed at, told you know nothing and get abused for your e-mails not being grammatically correct. You can't impress your boss with any accomplishments, all he cares about are power point presentations. He will use your presentations to look good in front of his boss. You will not have access to any data or systems, trying to get access will send you in a loop to India and back to the US with no result. Forget all your skills learnt previously, they are useless. Everything revolves around meetings and presentations. You are expected to know things about every business automatically. Every meeting feels like a quiz where you are asked detailed questions about some business process on some line of business in Europe. You will not know the answer and your boss won't either, but he will expect you to find out. Unfortunately no one in Europe will respond to you with information, or will send you some canned nonsense.I can go on and on, but its better to do the smart thing and jump ship like so many have done in 2019"

There is a gigantic and impenetrable Iron Curtain between management and employees. There is no one to go to and adddress concerns as an employee, since management/HR are committed to the vow of absolute blind bonding amonst themselves and against the fellow employees.  The annual reviews are blatant mockeries. Managers are delivering their \"evaluations\" based on bogus assessments and claims, knowingly so, affording a sarcastic hideous smile while delivering your \"development in place\" plan for the next period. No performance review complaint has been ever resolved, indifferent of how strong was the evidence presented to support such claim. Illustrous is the case of an employee reveiving the exceptional assessment \"Exceeds Honeywell Standards\" from the Program Manager he worked for the entirely complete year, and yet the Manager responsible for this employee's annual performance review, downgraded him to \"Below Honeywell Standards\", requiring his inductance in a Performance Improvement Plan for the next year.

I mean absolute ZERO besides empty speeches and hollow promises that are expected to deliver no outcome. They rarely visit the plant, facilities to determine the health, safety and environment of the employees.\r\n15) All the neighboring industrial zones have been marked for restoration.

Simply put, if you work here you're just a number; a metric, not a person with a life outside Honeywell. And this company will work you until they either break you or lay you off. There are better and more stable engineering companies out there.\r\nVery little development or promotional opportunities unless you're in the senior, upper leadership. I rarely see regular engineers/ managers promoted to the next level in any SBU.\r\nHoneywell is a very bloated company.

Many people that work there, you can see it in their eyes that they died  inside a long time ago and are just going through the daily motions. The building is old and decrepit, and in a small, difficult to get to town in Southern Germany. If you spend more than 10 Euros a day on food while travelling, you will get asked by your manager to explain yourself. The company is INCREDIBLY cheap when it comes to travel. If you take a taxi somewhere, i.e. to get dinner, etc, expect to have to explain yourself to an angry manager yelling at you for \"wasting the company's money\".   Management initially expected me to drive 5 hours starting at 4am, so I could be at a day long meeting at 9am to save the cost of a night at a hotel. I refused.  Management is also extremely micro-managerial.  Even when you are in training and not doing much in the way of actually dealing with accounts or visiting clients or talking to anyone yet, expect to have to send multiple daily fluff emails to your manager to keep them satisfied.  Also, the training is TERRIBLE. I was a sales account manager, and the training I was given was days long, and designed for an installation technician, not a member of the sales team. It was absolutely useless and covered nothing about value proposition, the competition, features, benefits, etc. You know, the useful stuff a sales person might need to know in order to sell a product. It seemed like they really had no plan and no direct sales experience.  There was also no lead generation mechanism, or Business development department. You are expected to cold call giant international Fortune 500 corporations...in Germany.  Good luck with that!  2 weeks into working for Honeywell, I already hated it and regretted accepting their offer. 4 weeks into it, I had already made up my mind to quit and started sending out new resumes, and by week 6, before I had even gotten my ears wet, and just as I was finishing \"training\", I simply couldn't take it any more.  Other members of my team ( who started when I did, and who I became good friends with) had similar misgivings. Time will tell how long they'll last there. I suspect not very long. I have NEVER worked at a company that I hated so much, so quickly. This was the shortest job I ever had and it felt like a piano had been lifted off my shoulder when I left.

Honeywell now exists by buying other companies and stripping them.\r\n\r\nHoneywell's best engineers now work for a company started by former Honeywell employees. That company has taken Honewyell's 90% market share, has taken most of Honeywell's engineers and is now THE leading supplier in the market segment.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely zero opportuities for advancement. I have been told on 3 separate occassions that I would not be considered for a job in the US because tHonewyell was not prepared to bring someone from offshore\r\n\r\nPerformance reviews and recognition are a very poor joke. I have been personally told that senior management downgraded the review given by my manager, in order to meet a quota and avoid giving me a pay increase\r\n\r\nSalaries have been frozen for 3 years\r\n\r\nWe took a mandated pay cut this year but managers still expected us to work the same overtime and weekend hours over and above a 40 hour week.\r\n\r\nThey have forgotten how to look after the cusomers. 4 years ago I had a travel budget of $125,000 to visit the customers and resolve their problems. My budget this year, to do the same job, is $12,000.\r\n\r\nManagers are fascinated with surveys, and use them to get the ratings they want, rather than recognizing the genuine customer concerns expressed in surveys. I have personally had managers tell me that they ignored certain well respected industry surveys becasue they were negative.\r\n\r\nDownsizing has been the constant theme since the Allied Signal acquisition.\r\n\r\nGives lip service to training but in reality does not provide it. I have had to go troubleshoot completely new systems with zero product training prior to seeing the system on the aircraft.\r\n\r\nManagement philosophy is to try to imitate GE. They have not succeeded.\r\n\r\nOver the last ten years I have watched a $300M business unit become a $30M business unit, while the stock price has been protected by cost cutting.

Honeywell essentially buys smaller companies and lets them run, so as a designer you can step in and help them build better products and experiences.",
		"cons": "The industrial design management is horrific and created a toxic work environment. ID management's style is essentially a bat about the head and neck. ID management uses verbal abuse as the primary management tool, followed up by tirades and berating language. ID management lies about what is expected from you, making things like deliverables change from day to day. ID management has unrealistic and hidden expectations about how design and designers should work, and uses that against the designers. ID management takes no responsibility for anything as far as I could tell.\r\nHere is an example: I met ID management at one of the Honeywell subsidiaries in the  suburbs of a major midwestern city for a kick off meeting around designing new fire control systems. This is a typical product development meeting, where the designers meet with engineers to understand technical limitations (manufacturing electronics etc) and meet with product management, who own the business side of the products (what it needs to do, and cost and who its for). These meetings are what they sound like, a kick off- a chance to meet your product development partners and get on the same page. Designers typically leave these meetings and put plans to gather for the project; schedule, process resources etc.\r\nI walked into this facility and ID management pulled me aside immediately into an empty office and began dressing me down about why I had not brought a presentation to show these people. I was horrified that I had missed this assignment and had no idea what ID management was referring to- it was a kick off meeting, we were there to learn.  Then it became apparent this was one more wacky mind game. As I caught myself I realized no one even asked me if I had a presentation, ID management just laid into me for NOT having a presentation.\r\nThat is the type of mind games I constantly endured at Honeywell, and the type of behavior Honeywell believes makes them successful.\r\n As a designer please stay away. It is a stifling and crushing creative environment. ID management is doing nothing that remotely looks like it's heading Honeywell toward the 'Apple of the Industrials'.\r\nIn short its the worst job I have EVER had in my life. And I have had some lame jobs."

Don't think about the individual growth as the management is only worried about monthly and yearly goals and how to achieve those Savings by setting the high targets which are impossible to achieve.\r\n9. You feel like working in a kingdom type or in a school. Every manager thinks that they are dictators and deploy business strategies and principles in the same way.

		"cons": "- Changes in education reimbursement policy (was 100%, is currently below 6,000 annual cap for graduate degree) makes the company less desirable to work for.  \r\n\r\n- Other companies pay more\r\n\r\n- All company picnics/charitable monetary matches/open houses cancelled.\r\n\r\n- in current economy, management is focused on short term results affecting bottom line only (via outsourcing of internal work and supply base, contract push-out's, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Management is not fostering healthy supplier relationships - actions being taken will cause future business with suppliers to suffer\r\n\r\n- Performance reviews not taken seriously by all management - reviews and merits are based on a quota system.  Additionally, employees are not given proper access to resources, time, and training in order to meet specific goals.  Certain initiatives (relating to order policy, dock/reciepts scheduling, etc) actually make goals more difficult to achieve.  All employees have same goals (cut & paste template flowed down to all) in Performance Tracking system.  \r\n\r\n- Honeywell corporate focuses on 40 hours mandatory training per year in their recruiting process.  However, Aerospace does not support employee development/training, especially in hard financial times or end-of-year timeframe.   The Six Sigma Certification is more a \"degree mill\" than learning process resulting in tangible process improvements.  Teams have been certified in less than 1 week when in actuality a Green Belt/Six Sigma project should takes several weeks.\r\n\r\n- employee morale very low.  Management experiences high turnover in terms of people & initiatives/policies.  \r\n\r\n- Increase in salary is based upon your relationship with management (who you know) & roles changes, not so much excelling in one's current position.  Most do not stay in a role more than 18 months (little personal or financial incentive to do so).  This results in little positive impact to the business - the employee learns the job and leaves for another job and bump in pay.\r\n\r\n- extreme fear of layoffs as sourcing, production & support acitivity is phased out to low-cost regions abroad.\r\n\r\n- Changes in health care policy to \"encourage\" voluntary retirement viewed as unethical by some emloyees further decreasing employee morale and loyality.\r\n\r\n- Top executive bonuses do not match pay cuts inflicted upon employees actually performing the work which keeps parts moving & customers satisfied."

		"duration": "N/A",
		"pros": "This job allowed me to develop my technical background as it provided me with all the necessary tools to learn and to improve as a professional. As many companies in the USA have already outsourced their operations and manufacturing, it is very hard to find jobs that can offer you technical on-hands development, except for Apple, Google, Samsung, and the big competitive ones... \r\nBut, that was in the past as Honeywell current direction is to go to ODM and third party manufacturing nowadays...",
		"cons": "There is no culture in this place. People do not have sense or urgency, no sense of ownership, no sense of belonging. No training offered: no courses in finance or in life, no nothing that can help you improve as a person. There are some sexual harassment in workplace and some adultery, where there are people sleeping with others. There are people who are aware of this too. There are people who drink alcohol in the job and do not get reprimanded. It seems there is no strong HR policies enforcement in place.   \r\n\r\nThere are people who have been here for 30+ years. They are slow and hard to deal with. They are not used to changes nor to adapt things to current situations. All they do is to let thing sit, whine, and perish. They always do things in a certain way. When new product was introduced they didn't know what to do and didn't want to think outside the box in figuring out other quality measurements and tests, but complained: \"we used to do it in this way and what is wrong in doing it in the same way that we have been doing it for the past 20 years\". Did you just hear what you just said?! The customer behavior changed, the product changed, if you test it in the same way as the past 20 years then your test result will fail! \r\n\r\nThere are individuals that had been there for ~40 years or more, they don't do anything but to sleep on the job. When issue come, they hide inside a locked room and blames the factory for unfinished and not working setups. They intentionally come to work at 630am in the morning to pretend to work and so that nobody is at work and they don't have to work at all, and leave work at 230pm. This way the working time is the least possible overlapping with other people's working time. This is really smart. \r\n\r\nThere are people that go to Mexico often, but don't know how to lean the process to deal with Mexico. Their suggestions conflict with the response from Mexico departments. They are unable to solve issues with regards to Mexico, unable to optimize the operations with Mexico, and are stuck with the same ECN process, and assume the process is fine and properly working. Another expired resource stuck in the times of the past... \r\n\r\nThere are people who seem to only know how to manage toolings. They don't seem to be kind in learning other skills or other tasks. They are always walking around in the halls, would look at any excuse to have a long conversation. The conversation could last for 20-30 minutes about fishing. Instead of finding ways to resolve issues or help you to find solutions, they would rather chat until you forget what the issues were and walk away. Other people find excuses to not work and walk away as if nothing happened... \r\n \r\nThe right hand does not know what the left hand is doing, and viceversa.  Whatever optimization a group is doing then it will definitely affect other groups and the same applies for other group. Groups are working in silo and there is no clear sense of direction as a company and no communication in between. Groups are not involved in design and there seems to be no management guidance in the company.\r\n\r\nSourcing in Mexico is a mess. They cannot do anything and they are mostly bound with agreements with vendors. They are non responsive. As they do not respond to your emails. They cannot get their job done properly. And someone from another team/division has to  fill in for their shoes and do their job properly. \r\n\r\nMexico factory is a mess. They do not respond to your email. By the time they respond to your email the person that was in charge has already left the job. The turnover rate in Mexico is very big. There is always a new person in charge every two months. They are not responsive and not responsible. You get lots of headache dealing with them on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nThere is no work from home policy. Or very few access to work from home. Guys, it is modern times, other companies are offering work from home policies because it improves work life balance. This division does not offer work from home to majority because they consider it as an additional expenses of $3/month per people. This is nothing compared to the boost in performance that you get from people. \r\n\r\nThe laptops they provide are bulky and heavy. Not really portable. \r\n\r\nCoffee machines are old and obsolete. It takes them forever to warm water and they are noisy and slow. The coffee beans used taste bad and they don't change them for better one. It seems that they are lazy to improve the coffee beans or order the cheapest coffee beans. Some of them are nest of cockroaches, extra flavor for you!\r\n\r\nBenefits keep on going down year by year. Honeywell health policy states to penalize people based on BMI. If your BMI is outside your range then you get penalized by $500. If your BMI does not improve but degrades with respect to last year's then you get penalized by additional $500. This policy shouldn't be legal, but apparently it is legal. Instead of penalizing the worker by such policies, it should encourage instead by providing games with fitbit and apple watches that give bonuses and activities to improve health like other companies are curretly doing. But, Honeywell chooses the negative action instead... Another benefit are the unwanted furlough that they provide you when the sales are down. I would prefer layoff than this so that you can inject new energy and new blood into the culture or to develop a culture, if there is one left... \r\n\r\nHoneywell implemented unlimited vacations starting 2018. But this is at the discretion of the manager. The policy is quote on quote \"unlimited\" to attract applicants, but in reality it is not widely implemented. Honeywell does not follow the honor system nor plan to implement such policy. However, this unlimited vacation is good for Honeywell in terms of layoffs and quitting because Honeywell no longer needs to compensate the extra time to their ex-workers. Do not think that an old conglomerate will be able to easily adapt to the current work policies. This company is old and will always be old to adapt to current times.  \r\n\r\nThere are many more issues in this division that I am not going to mention anymore because the list can get pretty long and I am tired of writing as well. There are lots of issues, lots of them... If you can choose NOT to work for this company, then please do so, I'd definitely recommend you to work at somewhere else that gives you better benefits and are better company than this one. It is NOT worth it to have Honeywell in your resume. The CONS are greater than the PROS... Take my advise for it!\r\n\r\nHoneywell is too big and has too many divisions, too many products that sell at high  volume, and brand name. That's why this company can still survive with an internal mess. They do not care as little to some income keeps on pouring in. And when divisions do not work, then they sell it off or spin it off. Kudos to management!"

Middle management then tasked with setting standard to measure morale - employees caring enough about the company to submit their own ideas for \"continuous improvements\" (CI's). Lower management is tasked with achieving measurable morale in the form of the volume of CI's - two a month. Bottom management puts a gun to each employee's head and tells them they'd better turn in 2 CI's a month or it'll go in their next performance review making them vulnerable the next time they have layoffs. Employees reluctantly turn in any CI's that'll give them two a month, including things like \"found pen on floor, picked it up\". Upper management sees numbers and thinks morale goals have been met, avalanche of mostly-worthless CI's waste several people's time, and employee morale couldn't be worse. This pretty much sums up everything Honeywell does.\r\n\r\nSafety: Safety SEEMS to be a MAJOR concern for Honeywell! ... unless it's too inconvenient or expensive, then hell with ya. HSE's goal is not to keep the employees safe, but to reduce Honeywell's liability.\r\n\r\nPay: Rates have been frozen for well over a decade. After 8 years I was still making only 76% of the industry's standard for STARTING pay in the same job.\r\n\r\nPeople: Most co-workers are hard-working and friendly people. Team Leads are too often unqualified simpletons with too much liability and not enough authority. Supervisors stay in their offices and don't want to be bothered with any of that work-related stuff. Upper management are usually polite but clueless. They set impossible standards based on BS numbers and the production floor creates more BS to look like they achieved it.\r\n\r\nAdvancement: None. Seriously, not a chance in hell.\r\n\r\nI have never in my life worked for a company that has so perfectly represented the stereotypes of corporate bureaucracy.

When management was told by professionals that managers were not listening, an additional dozen or so managers were hired from internal personnel.  Actually most of the people who weren't listening were promoted.  Don't even attempt to try to tell your immediate supervisor, much less management, that they might be doing something wrong or incorrectly, and that there might be a better way to get things done. Big on 'people are our most important asset', but a lot of lip service and little action. To contrast, there were people being treated rather well.  Must be some method to the madness. The culture seemed strange at this location in promoting managers who were not getting the job done.

		"cons": "God. Where do I start? Since the new leadership has taken over, there has been a consistent effort to single handedly take ridiculous steps to curtail benefits and change policies all in the name of savings. They advertise about the company being \u2018One Honeywell\u2019 and there being nothing like HTS India or Honeywell International but the truth is that HTS India employees are now treated as these cheap cost animals that are available to grind. Their travel policies are extremely biased towards them. Your managers will ask you to travel for 28 days to US and the policy is such that you don\u2019t get one rupee extra for having lived away from your family. The make reimbursements on actuals for up to 30 days. But then your on-site stakeholder says can you please extend your stay beyond 30 days. You extend and you\u2019ll never get paid per diem because your original travel was planned for 30 days. It is disgusting. \n\nThe new leadership feels they are tightening these policies and getting great margins but there\u2019s been a steady talent drain from Honeywell and most managers will agree to this in private. This will eventually drive the innovation to ground. \nRecently they have started playing a new tune \u201cTHERE WILL BE RECESSION SO WE NEED TO BE READY\u201d this is yet another effort to squeeze the employee benefits to drive cost savings. \n\nThe work itself is structured in a way that most of your counterparts would be based on US. So everyday evening is work evening and you are expected to take calls and attend meetings. On being asked if all the work happens in evenings then whys that we still follow IST morning to evening times and why not have 1400HRS to 2300HRS shifts like rest of the US overlapping companies do and some other teams in Honeywell itself do, people were told that it was not required since everyone had laptops and they can work from home (note that internet is not paid for by company). It is obvious that this is to avoid additional shift allowance and transportation cost liability. This practice ensures that employee is in work mode from 800hrs in morning to 2300hrs in evening everyday. Call it an air conditioned sweatshop."
