I really love getting to work with and meet so many people from across the world, best experience I\u2019ve had with international work at all. \n\nI\u2019ve had some drama with coworkers and a mediocre manager, but less than I\u2019m used too. There are a few cliques, but surprisingly few given the companies size. Allied Signal was not highly regarded, and those from Allied tend to be\u2026gruff\u2026at best. However, Garrett and the original Honeywell tend to brighten up the workplace.\n\nIf nothing else, Honeywell is huge, and offers a lot of possibilities and helps you along to them.

Many originally expected to be forced to go back full time in 2022, but enough employee surveys demanding WFH stay forced corporate to keep a flex schedule of three days in the office and two days at home. Nonetheless, it came, and still continues to come with a strong discouragement of work from home in general. I had to go back to work on a flex schedule on July 2021 while every other tech and aerospace company wasn\u2019t even fathoming in office work. Fortunately, the flex schedule is here to stay, but the company\u2019s resistance is a definite draw back. It\u2019s primarily the CEO fighting it, seems he\u2019s losing though, so the company is quietly starting to remove or silence opposition to WFH. \n\nHoneywell Aero is particularly disorganized to the point that it affects day to day work. The company historically has cut key functions that now underperform due to low staffing and other functions are expected to pick up the slack, just cause. Have to work with a number of people who lack the knowledge and understanding of our own internal systems and data while demanding an explanation for changes their function controls  \u2014 not realizing their function even does do the activity they\u2019re questioning. \n\nThe company is WAY too management heavy. I\u2019m no stranger to elaborate corporate hierarchies, but Honeywell seemed to take overhead to the max. The company joke is that \u201cat Honeywell, you\u2019ll have two VPs, four directors, five managers,  and all their support staff on a status call given by one individual contributor who actually works a revenue generating product\u201d. This company doesn\u2019t seem to think that it\u2019s questionable that 3 levels of a organization are on every call together \u2014 if the VP is in every call, why is there two directors and four managers on the same calls?

And its no wonder. In addition to points above, the company pays industry average salaries and wages. When being promoted, the worker will have to aggressively negotiate merit increases, otherwise HR will be happy to award you a pat on the back a consider you lucky with a 1-1.5%% increase in salary to award you for taking on more responsibilities. Which in many cases dis enchants employees and causes the employee to take a new job elsewhere. There are 0 thing this company does to retain talent. No retention bonuses, vesting stock or stock options, or pensions. Honeywell has an industry average contribution to your 401K. There is a no vacation policy. This is sold to the employee as \"you can take as much time off as you want- as long as your boss approves it\". This leaves senior long term employees who've spent a career earning more vacation time every year with basically the same amount of vacation time as the new hire right out of college.

The production workers are also not eligible for any bonuses, and the wages are barely competitive. The bonuses and pay are reserved for the \"band 4\" employees, which is basically mid level management and above. Every day we look at the \"cost\" of running our business, which is a balance that's tipped toward \"how can we extract as much labor as humanly possible without incurring any additional cost?\" For hourly production, it's mandatory 6-day work weeks for 3 years straight and for management it's failing to backfill when someone else leaves by dumping that workload onto someone else until they leave. \r\n\r\nBut hey, unlimited PTO, amiright?\r\n\r\nI also found out shortly after being hired that management often gets laid off for a few weeks at a time to cut the cost and pad the bottom line.

My immediate team / function wasn\u2019t the nicest, but made good connections across the country / world due to the regular work with international sites. It didn\u2019t take long to start building a network, remotely and in person, that helped provide support, advice, and helped steer my career. I really love getting to work with and meet so many people from across the world, best experience I\u2019ve had with international work at all. \n\nI\u2019ve had some drama with coworkers and a mediocre manager, but less than I\u2019m used too. There are a few cliques, but surprisingly few given the companies size. Allied Signal was not highly regarded, and those from Allied tend to be\u2026gruff\u2026at best. However, Garrett and the original Honeywell tend to brighten up the workplace.\n\nIf nothing else, Honeywell is huge, and offers a lot of possibilities and helps you along to them. Excited to move to a new role in a new function that\u2019ll support teams worldwide, a dream come true.", "cons": "Company wise, the work from home policy; it\u2019s draconian at best. Many originally expected to be forced to go back full time in 2022, but enough employee surveys demanding WFH stay forced corporate to keep a flex schedule of three days in the office and two days at home. Nonetheless, it came, and still continues to come with a strong discouragement of work from home in general. I had to go back to work on a flex schedule on July 2021 while every other tech and aerospace company wasn\u2019t even fathoming in office work. Fortunately, the flex schedule is here to stay, but the company\u2019s resistance is a definite draw back. It\u2019s primarily the CEO fighting it, seems he\u2019s losing though, so the company is quietly starting to remove or silence opposition to WFH. \n\nHoneywell Aero is particularly disorganized to the point that it affects day to day work. The company historically has cut key functions that now underperform due to low staffing and other functions are expected to pick up the slack, just cause. Have to work with a number of people who lack the knowledge and understanding of our own internal systems and data while demanding an explanation for changes their function controls  \u2014 not realizing their function even does do the activity they\u2019re questioning. \n\nThe company is WAY too management heavy. I\u2019m no stranger to elaborate corporate hierarchies, but Honeywell seemed to take overhead to the max. The company joke is that \u201cat Honeywell, you\u2019ll have two VPs, four directors, five managers,  and all their support staff on a status call given by one individual contributor who actually works a revenue generating product\u201d. This company doesn\u2019t seem to think that it\u2019s questionable that 3 levels of a organization are on every call together \u2014 if the VP is in every call, why is there two directors and four managers on the same calls? You can see it costs the company a lot to have all this management by how quickly they remove perks like free coffee, the cafeteria, etc. to save a quick buck."}], [{"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Senior Estimator in Burnaby, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good mentors and leaders to help you grow.", "cons": "Salary and incentives could be better."}, {"review_title": "Senior Configuration Management Analyst", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Configuration Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flecible, fast-paced, networking, user friendly", "cons": "Time consuming, location or product specific training"}, {"review_title": "Nice place to work at", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Advanced R&D Engineer/Scientist in Buffalo, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work environment is nice and people are friendly.

And its no wonder. In addition to points above, the company pays industry average salaries and wages. When being promoted, the worker will have to aggressively negotiate merit increases, otherwise HR will be happy to award you a pat on the back a consider you lucky with a 1-1.5%% increase in salary to award you for taking on more responsibilities. Which in many cases dis enchants employees and causes the employee to take a new job elsewhere. There are 0 thing this company does to retain talent. No retention bonuses, vesting stock or stock options, or pensions. Honeywell has an industry average contribution to your 401K. There is a no vacation policy. This is sold to the employee as \"you can take as much time off as you want- as long as your boss approves it\". This leaves senior long term employees who've spent a career earning more vacation time every year with basically the same amount of vacation time as the new hire right out of college.
