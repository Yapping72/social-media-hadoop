OP from Labour Day'21 mentioned alot of facts.\r\n\r\nHigher management \"forced\" everyone to sign a \"voluntary unpaid leave e-form\". Something what I have never imagined would happened in a MNC. Why want to implement the forced \"voluntary unpaid leave e-form\"? Highly likely because he already knew it was against the SG law to forced employees to take unpaid leaves, and that form was meant to protect himself in case someone whistleblow and MOM checks. And yet he still went ahead with it. Called it voluntary but said that a list of names of who signed/have no signed will be sent to himself. Why these actions if it is meant to be voluntary??\r\n\r\nMaybe desperate to cut cost too for Covid-19, but as someone receiving a high pay/month, using this kind of method just meant he does not have the capabilities to come up with other solutions and unfit to be in that position. Paid highly to solve the issue but chose a solution that goes against the law.\r\n\r\nLabour Day'21 has mentioned alot but not everything. It is just the tip of the iceberg. Not sure about other dept but if u join as a engineer (regardless of title name), you will be wasting your time doing mindless stuff out of your jobscope and learning nothing ! Eg: Go to customer office to collect payment cheque, deliver back to office and end up with no time to do other work, only to be criticized for not managing time properly.\r\n\r\nHoneywell squeeze engineers dry and engineers does everything.

Capable engineers were loaded more heavily.\r\n\r\n- The engineers were working on all sorts of different projects, as long as they were related to their fields.

No employee handbook existing but they will implement rules whenever needed without clear understanding from the employees side.The contract that you signed tends to change from time to time, Example- You signed up to follow Philippine Holidays but you will be asked to report on PH holidays anyway.

I was told its a \u201cManager approved vacation only\u201d and i shouldn't expect as a new employee to get more than 1 week vacation a year. Also i have routinely worked 50+ hour weeks with no relief or \u201cgetting to leave earlier another day\u201d it just simply is not true.\n\n3. Huge turnover. Basically Honeywell changed a lot of policies and people who had been in the company for years all quit. My group consist basically of all new people. Which brings me to my 4th statement.\n\n4.

Literally, I don't even think it is a consideration. It is all about cutting costs, no innovation. If your company gets acquired by this beast, get out! All they will do is lay off all your support staff, off shore you jobs, make you grateful for a 1% raise, furlough you for 2 weeks every year, then lay you off. Upper engineering management is all show, not go. One dumb-assed idea, after another, all failing. They come up with a stupid strategic direction, pound you into the ground to hit a date, it doesn't sell, and it is your fault. Literally, unless you are starving, or they are hitting you at work, look elsewhere. If this company was a movie, it would the The Event Horizon, and not the good universe.

Over the years, you reach the ceiling of pay scale for your grade, and then you are stuck. You need to change jobs internally by following complete interview process to be considered for promotion to next grade, also it's very rare. They pay you good salary while hiring and are not shy to make better offer for deserving candidates, so negotiate well. They hire from top Schools and top companies. Highly supports diversity candidates.",

This company doesn't care about employees at all. The top management say, we are not meeting business goals, hence they are taking 10% paycut, and expect employees to take 10 days paycut, but by doing so, they push up share price and take home thick bonuses from profit sharing and the poor employees are left poorer. Everything is short term in this company, nothing is process driven, everything is person driven. Top management and leaders (even foot soldiers) get fired often. Hire and fire is core HR policy, even the HR leader accepted it himself. Severance pay is just equal to notice period payout. If you work hard and deliver results, you will get more and more work pushed at you with no appreciation. Top to down management will encourage employees to fight with each other, there is no team spirit, people are busy pulling each other's legs, to save themselves."

The safety culture here is horrible. The company has no values and their only goals involve making some predefined profit target. They have no idea how to motivate people to be their best or produce anything of value for society. \n\nThey have no idea what it takes to properly engineer and fabricate process equipment. They are misrepresenting their capabilities to the US government and are milking the government for funding. Most employees I met don't do anything and are miserably bored but they bill the government week after week for projects that deliver absolutely nothing. This place is a huge scam.

Very basic electrical problems became very daunting tasks from the lack of knowledge and pure incompatense from the department with the exeption of one that had a couple years of OJT.

		"cons": "Furloughs, layoffs. Long hours (7am -7pm generally), including weekends if you want to advance. In reality, though, the stress results in work not escaping your thoughts, including your sleep (upper management says this type of all-consuming stress is a best practice; you should be obsessed with work, and anything less amounts to a lack of accountability). No true cohesive team culture - all about putting everyone else down to make yourself look better. Textbook large corporation hiding behind surface level D&I initiatives to the public, but in practice internally everyone is intentionally made to feel disposable and worthless unless business results are achieved - you have no inherent human value as a person, you're only valuable to the extent that the company achieves its quarterly goals. No room for creativity, because everyone is given an impossibly long list of non-value tasks to execute (setup for failure). Leaders do not ask fundamental questions like, \"How are you doing with your workload? Do you think this is the right approach? Do you have too much on your plate? Do you need more resources?\" Very little interest in you as a person. Leaders consistently dropping f bombs and generally cursing at each other, blaming/pointing fingers, condescending toward each other regardless of the amount of effort. I see little to no true \"leadership\" or sense of teamwork taking place. Practically speaking, it is 100% micromanagement from the top CFO down to analyst and across every team. Unnecessary rudeness is explicitly encouraged to drive results. The pay is good, but similar enough pay can be found elsewhere for significantly less stress. It isn't about the amount of work - that is expected if you are well compensated - it's the way people treat each other and the complete absence of any true leaders. Life is too short to be a part of an environment of borderline, and in some cases, outright verbal abuse, harassment, and dehumanization. Very little positivity to be found, and any attempt to voice these concerns through your manager are entirely dismissed - you are told to not let other people's emotions affect you. No hope going through human resources for fear of retaliation from management and HR exists solely to protect the employer, not the employee."

Joking aside - the majority of your job ends up focusing on how to prepare a PowerPoint report to support weekly, monthly or quarterly activities. This is true at all levels - from analysts to VPs. - A complete lack of onboarding. - RFIs and furloughs throughout Q3 and Q4 2022 (SPS) - Fairly average pay, especially after factoring in lost wages from multiple furloughs. - No work-life balance. You get emails and Teams messages in the evening, on weekends, and it's up to you to set the expectations of whether you are available or not. - If you are outside of the US (Europe, Asia, etc...) be prepared for late night meetings since teams are internationally dispersed, often leading to meetings outside of the normal business hours for those outside of the US. - Can be very political with a lot of CYA - Underwhelming benefits - Good 401(k) plan through Fidelity, but company matching only kicking in at the end of the year, so if you do not stay for a full calendar year you will miss out on this. Coupled with average pay and salary deductions due to furloughs you end up leaving money on the table so to speak."

I was working on products that were 20 years old and were completely outdated compared to what our competitors (or even Honeywell) was offering, but sales was insisting to keep them because of 1-2 regional customers. - Upper management talks, lower management does BAU - C-Level and Directors were constantly announcing changes or projects that never really happened - No clear guidelines or org chart - I had to go virtually around the world several times in order to find out who is responsible to paying our suppliers and then twice again in order to justify that the supplier actually needs to be paid. The finance department were one of the biggest mysteries - Escalate - the most user word in Honeywell. Everything needs to be escalated, the smallest issue, the most insignificant setback need to be escalated and after it is escalated leadership does exactly nothing to fix the issue, so you are either stuck with it or take a risk and solve it on your own and get in trouble later."

This resulted in many (including possibly myself) being thrust into leadership positions maybe a bit earlier than deserved or needed (very trial-by-fire atmosphere) - Multiple furloughs and reductions in force during my tenure - you are at the whim of the market and leadership - Rigid time-off and pay structures. - Extremely anti-union - this in of itself was not that significant but their treatment of a non-union shop (being so fearful of any hint of union activity) made it difficult to manage as a people-leader.

		"cons": "Never seen turnover as bad as at Honeywell. Easy to see why once I joined. Here's the list. Performance management is bell curved, so you are required to have non-performers. This antiquated idea is a demotivator and causes knowledge hording, team discord. Ambiguous company slogans, such as \"Think Big\", are used as performance metrics. Slogans are not performance metrics - they often cite overlapping , unmeasurable, skills. Funding is often frozen for aspects of a program - so R&D is unable to work on a program even when they are at work! When these freezes happen, you would expect milestones to move, right? Nope. You know how perf reviews are never supposed to be a surprise. Forget that notion. The same HR organization that runs the bell curved reviews is also responsible for engineering integrity. So if you raise engineering integrity issues, you WILL get a bad review. FYI - Honeywell makes aerospace parts, like engines and landing gear. Program war room meetings use VP level execs to intimidate working level employees: \"When can that be done?\", \"Why was that milestone missed?\" from VP to junior employees. Estimates from working level employees rarely account for overhead, rework and side effects, that's what first and second level managers are for. Honeywell eliminated first level managers (called tier 5). Blame is pushed downwards - directors and VPs are never held accountable and are frequently changed on a program (roughly every 2 years). People are blamed over process. Many processes make doing your job difficult or impossible, for example net 120 for suppliers, but net 30 for customers. Many suppliers won't work with Honeywell, especially for the quantities R&D NPI programs need. Project managers spend more time massaging metrics than managing programs. Days to convert standard automated burnup chart from Jira into burndown chart for executive consumption (they didn't get it otherwise). Enforcing the same tool across the entire company: if it's selected for manufacturing, it must be the right tool for everyone. At one point it was proposed that Sharepoint or Oracle Agile PLM by used for software source control. I once asked a VP how the finance department knew that our engineering estimate for a new product was 20% too high. He said they did comparitive analysis (!). The product didn't exist anywhere else, no other company was building it, and the last program we had that had tried to outsource it had failed (>$100M). We were estimating less than the last failure cost and it was still too much, according to finance. I found out later that all programs are undercut by finance by 20%, and usually run over the original estimate, so most engineering department were adding 25% to their costs to adjust."

		"job_title": "Advanced Cyber Security Researcher",
		"duration": "N/A",
		"pros": "My work background is pretty diverse: Military, Government Contractor, Start-up, and now Private Sector. This is how Honeywell ranks in comparison to those: Healthcare is good, it is categorized as an HDHP, but from the other places I worked, the Deductible and Out-Of-Pocket-Maximums are actually more in-line with other PPOs than HDHPs. The coverage for medicines and other stuff is better than most PPOs from other providers (this is coming from someone who has experience with family members that have chronic health issues). Work Environment: Very laid back, though this is likely dependent on your direct manager, my manager is awesome. Though dress code and stuff seems to be relaxed. I've seen people dressed up all the way to t-shirt and jeans. If you are in doubt on your first day, then go with some slacks and a polo. Hours: This depends on the job, but Honeywell is a global organization so you may work with people in different timezones. I have an early meeting typically, but management accurately adjusts expectations on end of day and arrival at the office. In-Office/Hybrid/Remote: I work in a \"hybrid\" role, and it is pretty awesome. I go into the office 3 days a week and work from home 2 days a week (though I typically work in a coffee shop on those days). This helps greatly because I live about 45 minutes away, so I don't have to commute every day. Either way, my manager is awesome and understanding of my time, as well as everyone I have come into contact with. The office is awesome IMO, has a cafeteria and is a nice quiet environment. If you enjoy your job and you are a hard worker, you will likely have 0 problems with this. 401K Benefits: Good, though the match only happens lump sum at the end of the year, so something to keep in mind if you are not planning on sticking around. Time-Off: I came from a \"Startup\" with an \"unlimited\" time off policy, which sadly just means you fall behind if you take time off, from what I have seen at Honeywell so far (at least by my manager), they legit make you feel comfortable with requesting time off. My manager has already told me multiple times, \"Just let me know if you need some time off\". The first day I started I let them know that I needed to a day off in like two months to go to a wedding and they asked if I needed more than just a day, which is the sign of a good manager! Either way, as with a lot of jobs, a lot of it depends on your manager. I would recommend that during your interviews, ensure you mesh well with your direct manager. A little advice, never think you are being interviewed for a job, always go into an interview with the primary purpose of you interviewing the job. If you are good at your job, you likely don't have an issue with getting one; use this to your advantage. The second I met with my manager, I knew we meshed pretty well as we had a similar background. I then met with their manager and a few other higher ups, and they all had a technical background and seemed very understanding. I look forwards to my future years with the company!",

OP from Labour Day'21 mentioned alot of facts.\r\n\r\nHigher management \"forced\" everyone to sign a \"voluntary unpaid leave e-form\". Something what I have never imagined would happened in a MNC. Why want to implement the forced \"voluntary unpaid leave e-form\"? Highly likely because he already knew it was against the SG law to forced employees to take unpaid leaves, and that form was meant to protect himself in case someone whistleblow and MOM checks. And yet he still went ahead with it. Called it voluntary but said that a list of names of who signed/have no signed will be sent to himself. Why these actions if it is meant to be voluntary??\r\n\r\nMaybe desperate to cut cost too for Covid-19, but as someone receiving a high pay/month, using this kind of method just meant he does not have the capabilities to come up with other solutions and unfit to be in that position. Paid highly to solve the issue but chose a solution that goes against the law.\r\n\r\nLabour Day'21 has mentioned alot but not everything. It is just the tip of the iceberg. Not sure about other dept but if u join as a engineer (regardless of title name), you will be wasting your time doing mindless stuff out of your jobscope and learning nothing ! Eg: Go to customer office to collect payment cheque, deliver back to office and end up with no time to do other work, only to be criticized for not managing time properly.\r\n\r\nHoneywell squeeze engineers dry and engineers does everything.

		"cons": "- We were always in a rush to get things out. In a way, the short time span for products/fixes to be released to the market is good for the business, but it's not healthy from the engineering standpoint. We were not given enough time to research extensively and think things through.\r\n\r\n- Workload could be heavy, to the point that personal time was sacrificed. \r\n\r\n- There was also an unbalanced allocation of workload. Capable engineers were loaded more heavily.\r\n\r\n- The engineers were working on all sorts of different projects, as long as they were related to their fields. Specialisation was not emphasised, and this might result in they becoming 'generalists' rather than 'specialists'. This is limiting the engineers' growth and the quality of their work."

No employee handbook existing but they will implement rules whenever needed without clear understanding from the employees side.The contract that you signed tends to change from time to time, Example- You signed up to follow Philippine Holidays but you will be asked to report on PH holidays anyway.

They block a lot of things (including web pages that are not on the whitelist). When you need support, you can barely contact any person directly.

		"cons": "Management does not care when your family member dies, doesn\u2019t care when have special occasions to attend critical to life, doesn\u2019t care that you\u2019re ill, or even having a baby. Interpersonal relationships here are lacking and terrible. Most relationships are only manufactured on the fact of \u201cthis place is terrible and let\u2019s complain about it.\u201d Get used to incredibly nasty management to the point of using foul and unprofessional language in meetings, hiding behind a computer screen as most are out of shape with zero hobbies, have a badge of honor stapled onto their suits. Many individuals do not encourage collaboration, rather let\u2019s just harass people on teams until the wee-hours of the night. Critical management in key positions is so unprofessional as to not even call people by their names. Hello, this is basic 101 how to be a professional in corp America. You will be dejected. The constant abuse from management beating you up, abusing you non stop while they go on week hiatuses for reasons you\u2019ll never understand. Over time even worse it will come into your personal and family relationships. Abuse, the best and only word to describe this place. During my time here I struggled greatly in so many aspects mentally. Days I would finish the day and question how I\u2019d be able to continue just into the next day. It\u2019s not where you want to work, trust me. Literally in my time I have counted over 35 individuals who have left the company. Yes, 35. Not making this up. I would say 50% of those 35 are critical mass in leading and directing key initiatives in the company. If director level individuals leave after a mere 4-5 weeks, you have to ask yourself what the hell is wrong here? Yes 4-5 weeks! The turnover rate is above 35%! Management will convince you you are learning so much (you\u2019re not, you just think you are because you work at Honeywell and the name is supposed to mean something).. You have people higher up on the company that when they turn the camera on, never seen a smile on their face ever, look so tired and miserable, sometimes I even wonder how they maintain a family life. Many key management folks are completely miserable and it shows. Nasty, toxic, and cursing out others IN meetings! Nobody deserves to speak to people like their peons, just cause where you sit at a company. Disgusting. The work life balance is insane, sometimes even comical at times. You will be ridiculed, brainwashed when you want to spend July 4th with your family - you have to be on! Reporting on fabrication of numbers takes precedence! Half the time you\u2019re left asking yourself why the hell am I even doing it this way? You\u2019ll find management will want you to scew numbers, fabricate results, drop budgets down by like millions of dollars out of nowhere to make certain ratios look pretty (I mean this is insane).. the ethical conduct in this place is a 0/5. Management plays a game that they\u2019re so busy, have no time to spend, meanwhile go out of office for weeks out of nowhere. Nobody seems to understand how to treat people in this place. There is no kindness. No true care for people. Back stabbing and giving bad reviews of other colleagues is pretty common. You will be talked about behind your back by the higher-ups if you aren\u2019t a brainwashed, overweight individual selling yourself to this sweat shop / meat grinder. You are just a number and get used to being a peon. It\u2019s a terrible place to work. I\u2019ve literally had people ask me how did you take this time off during seriously important times of my life, only for them to not even bat an eye and take off weeks for vacation months later! Insane. HR knows they got a problem but only seem to care about literally killing people to get in the office. You will be on surveillance otherwise. Meanwhile many of these jobs can be done in the confines of your own home. Expectations and goals are completely insane. You will not be able to keep up with the expectations they place on you. I promise you. Because every year they come up with other stuff to pull out their behinds to show people : \u201c we\u2019re Honeywell and we\u2019re cut throat.\u201d This place drives people to the ground, there is no knowledge sharing when people leave. No processes around transferring that knowledge to anybody. Then they complain when people leave, and even text and call them after they leave the company to understand key processes because they never even made the time to understand while they were there!!! Basics of how to do business fail here. How to operate in professional way they haven\u2019t a clue. Just a bureaucratic, political, weak culture that stems into all elements."

		"pros": "Very thorough. It's clear Honeywell has an interest in and committed to engaging all employees as many was as the employees will allow. Honeywell is a large corporation with reach into many industries and there are a lot of learnings associated with that reach. Additionally, the size of the corporation drives all the on-boarding activity. The systems and people are there to support the on-boarding - from the recruiter, the on-boarding assistant, and others and while going through it. A lot of time and effort have been put into this overall process.",
		"cons": "It's too much. I understand Honeywell is multi-national and has the US government as a customer but my job responsibilities have nothing to do with exporting or chemicals. Having those modules as requirements in the first month seems excessive and just convolutes the on-boarding. Also, there are a great many links in the digital process that do not work, or seem to not work, which is probably understandable in the digital age but if that much emphasis is going to be placed on the digital world, I think it ought to work better. As a new employee, I do not know where to go to address issues like that."

This can lead to stress, tension, and disharmony in the workplace. As a further result, a majority of Honeywell\u2019s management falls into 2 categories; Marionette boss: They are mere puppets who follow orders of the higher boss. They tend to exude no loyalty to their employees and never stands up for them. Taskmaster boss: Their sole focus is on the bottom line. Continuously drilling employees is a sure way that makes them unhappy at work. Micromanagement suffocates, demoralizes and kills creativity."

I spent my first 2 months trying to get my computer to work after starting and just being passed around.\n\n2. Managers are not your friends and want to work you to death. When i started this job i was told \u201cunlimited vacation\u201d sounds great. I was also told \u201cwe only expect 40 hours a week so if you stay longer one day feel free to leave earlier another day if you have the time\u201d. Except none of this is true. I was told its a \u201cManager approved vacation only\u201d and i shouldn't expect as a new employee to get more than 1 week vacation a year. Also i have routinely worked 50+ hour weeks with no relief or \u201cgetting to leave earlier another day\u201d it just simply is not true.\n\n3. Huge turnover. Basically Honeywell changed a lot of policies and people who had been in the company for years all quit. My group consist basically of all new people. Which brings me to my 4th statement.\n\n4. ABSOLUTELY NO TRAINING OR SOPs. This absolutely blew me away. The philosophy since i started has been \u201cfigure it out\u201d there is no documentation or SOP explaining key tasks nor is anyone around that knows how to do them because they quit."

My role entails something different every day, many projects, small and large, constantly evolving procedures, policies, some mind-numbingly frustrating, others, well thought out. one very important thing I find though is that people DO listen. if something's broken, you do feel empowered to be one that helps fix it. you can't say that of many Billion dollar global organisations. Unanimously though I can say that 99% of my interactions with the hundreds of internal staff globally that i've worked with has been positive. It's rare that you can genuinely reach out directly to almost anyone in the company and ask advice regarding what you're currently working on.",
		"cons": "I wish the seperate business divisions would communicate and intermix more. They push the brand 'one Honeywell' and are making fair inroads to it...it's just that we have sooo many touch points for a given project (Runway lighting, ,BMS, controls, general lighting, fire, security, life safety etc and more) , it's really hard for each separate entity to utilise common knowledge and provide solution packages to the end clients...... currently the approach seems more 'each business to it's own' BUT...I believe this is acknowledged and there are inroads to making this happen (abeit slowly) In some business divisions, it's confusing due to the wide range of products sold, often many parallel offerings doing almost the same thing! - makes a 5 minute elevator pitch quite hard...."

Literally, I don't even think it is a consideration. It is all about cutting costs, no innovation. If your company gets acquired by this beast, get out! All they will do is lay off all your support staff, off shore you jobs, make you grateful for a 1% raise, furlough you for 2 weeks every year, then lay you off. Upper engineering management is all show, not go. One dumb-assed idea, after another, all failing. They come up with a stupid strategic direction, pound you into the ground to hit a date, it doesn't sell, and it is your fault. Literally, unless you are starving, or they are hitting you at work, look elsewhere. If this company was a movie, it would the The Event Horizon, and not the good universe.

Over the years, you reach the ceiling of pay scale for your grade, and then you are stuck. You need to change jobs internally by following complete interview process to be considered for promotion to next grade, also it's very rare. They pay you good salary while hiring and are not shy to make better offer for deserving candidates, so negotiate well. They hire from top Schools and top companies. Highly supports diversity candidates.",

This company doesn't care about employees at all. The top management say, we are not meeting business goals, hence they are taking 10% paycut, and expect employees to take 10 days paycut, but by doing so, they push up share price and take home thick bonuses from profit sharing and the poor employees are left poorer. Everything is short term in this company, nothing is process driven, everything is person driven. Top management and leaders (even foot soldiers) get fired often. Hire and fire is core HR policy, even the HR leader accepted it himself. Severance pay is just equal to notice period payout. If you work hard and deliver results, you will get more and more work pushed at you with no appreciation. Top to down management will encourage employees to fight with each other, there is no team spirit, people are busy pulling each other's legs, to save themselves."

The safety culture here is horrible. The company has no values and their only goals involve making some predefined profit target. They have no idea how to motivate people to be their best or produce anything of value for society. \n\nThey have no idea what it takes to properly engineer and fabricate process equipment. They are misrepresenting their capabilities to the US government and are milking the government for funding. Most employees I met don't do anything and are miserably bored but they bill the government week after week for projects that deliver absolutely nothing. This place is a huge scam.

They also do not acknowledge when they have made any mistakes which causes even more issues, such as myself dealing with random safety hazards personally more than once with random potential arc flash, and electrocution. Very basic electrical problems became very daunting tasks from the lack of knowledge and pure incompatense from the department with the exeption of one that had a couple years of OJT. Even after approaching supervision mulitply times the safety concerns would just be forgotten.

		"cons": "Furloughs, layoffs. Long hours (7am -7pm generally), including weekends if you want to advance. In reality, though, the stress results in work not escaping your thoughts, including your sleep (upper management says this type of all-consuming stress is a best practice; you should be obsessed with work, and anything less amounts to a lack of accountability). No true cohesive team culture - all about putting everyone else down to make yourself look better. Textbook large corporation hiding behind surface level D&I initiatives to the public, but in practice internally everyone is intentionally made to feel disposable and worthless unless business results are achieved - you have no inherent human value as a person, you're only valuable to the extent that the company achieves its quarterly goals. No room for creativity, because everyone is given an impossibly long list of non-value tasks to execute (setup for failure). Leaders do not ask fundamental questions like, \"How are you doing with your workload? Do you think this is the right approach? Do you have too much on your plate? Do you need more resources?\" Very little interest in you as a person. Leaders consistently dropping f bombs and generally cursing at each other, blaming/pointing fingers, condescending toward each other regardless of the amount of effort. I see little to no true \"leadership\" or sense of teamwork taking place. Practically speaking, it is 100% micromanagement from the top CFO down to analyst and across every team. Unnecessary rudeness is explicitly encouraged to drive results. The pay is good, but similar enough pay can be found elsewhere for significantly less stress. It isn't about the amount of work - that is expected if you are well compensated - it's the way people treat each other and the complete absence of any true leaders. Life is too short to be a part of an environment of borderline, and in some cases, outright verbal abuse, harassment, and dehumanization. Very little positivity to be found, and any attempt to voice these concerns through your manager are entirely dismissed - you are told to not let other people's emotions affect you. No hope going through human resources for fear of retaliation from management and HR exists solely to protect the employer, not the employee."

		"cons": "- Too heavy on PowerPoint. There is a PowerPoint about how to complete a PowerPoint so you know how properly develop a PowerPoint. Joking aside - the majority of your job ends up focusing on how to prepare a PowerPoint report to support weekly, monthly or quarterly activities. This is true at all levels - from analysts to VPs. - A complete lack of onboarding. - RFIs and furloughs throughout Q3 and Q4 2022 (SPS) - Fairly average pay, especially after factoring in lost wages from multiple furloughs. - No work-life balance. You get emails and Teams messages in the evening, on weekends, and it's up to you to set the expectations of whether you are available or not. - If you are outside of the US (Europe, Asia, etc...) be prepared for late night meetings since teams are internationally dispersed, often leading to meetings outside of the normal business hours for those outside of the US. - Can be very political with a lot of CYA - Underwhelming benefits - Good 401(k) plan through Fidelity, but company matching only kicking in at the end of the year, so if you do not stay for a full calendar year you will miss out on this. Coupled with average pay and salary deductions due to furloughs you end up leaving money on the table so to speak."

I was working on products that were 20 years old and were completely outdated compared to what our competitors (or even Honeywell) was offering, but sales was insisting to keep them because of 1-2 regional customers. - Upper management talks, lower management does BAU - C-Level and Directors were constantly announcing changes or projects that never really happened - No clear guidelines or org chart - I had to go virtually around the world several times in order to find out who is responsible to paying our suppliers and then twice again in order to justify that the supplier actually needs to be paid. The finance department were one of the biggest mysteries - Escalate - the most user word in Honeywell. Everything needs to be escalated, the smallest issue, the most insignificant setback need to be escalated and after it is escalated leadership does exactly nothing to fix the issue, so you are either stuck with it or take a risk and solve it on your own and get in trouble later."

This resulted in many (including possibly myself) being thrust into leadership positions maybe a bit earlier than deserved or needed (very trial-by-fire atmosphere) - Multiple furloughs and reductions in force during my tenure - you are at the whim of the market and leadership - Rigid time-off and pay structures. - Extremely anti-union - this in of itself was not that significant but their treatment of a non-union shop (being so fearful of any hint of union activity) made it difficult to manage as a people-leader.

		"cons": "Never seen turnover as bad as at Honeywell. Easy to see why once I joined. Here's the list. Performance management is bell curved, so you are required to have non-performers. This antiquated idea is a demotivator and causes knowledge hording, team discord. Ambiguous company slogans, such as \"Think Big\", are used as performance metrics. Slogans are not performance metrics - they often cite overlapping , unmeasurable, skills. Funding is often frozen for aspects of a program - so R&D is unable to work on a program even when they are at work! When these freezes happen, you would expect milestones to move, right? Nope. You know how perf reviews are never supposed to be a surprise. Forget that notion. The same HR organization that runs the bell curved reviews is also responsible for engineering integrity. So if you raise engineering integrity issues, you WILL get a bad review. FYI - Honeywell makes aerospace parts, like engines and landing gear. Program war room meetings use VP level execs to intimidate working level employees: \"When can that be done?\", \"Why was that milestone missed?\" from VP to junior employees. Estimates from working level employees rarely account for overhead, rework and side effects, that's what first and second level managers are for. Honeywell eliminated first level managers (called tier 5). Blame is pushed downwards - directors and VPs are never held accountable and are frequently changed on a program (roughly every 2 years). People are blamed over process. Many processes make doing your job difficult or impossible, for example net 120 for suppliers, but net 30 for customers. Many suppliers won't work with Honeywell, especially for the quantities R&D NPI programs need. Project managers spend more time massaging metrics than managing programs. Days to convert standard automated burnup chart from Jira into burndown chart for executive consumption (they didn't get it otherwise). Enforcing the same tool across the entire company: if it's selected for manufacturing, it must be the right tool for everyone. At one point it was proposed that Sharepoint or Oracle Agile PLM by used for software source control. I once asked a VP how the finance department knew that our engineering estimate for a new product was 20% too high. He said they did comparitive analysis (!). The product didn't exist anywhere else, no other company was building it, and the last program we had that had tried to outsource it had failed (>$100M). We were estimating less than the last failure cost and it was still too much, according to finance. I found out later that all programs are undercut by finance by 20%, and usually run over the original estimate, so most engineering department were adding 25% to their costs to adjust."

		"pros": "My work background is pretty diverse: Military, Government Contractor, Start-up, and now Private Sector. This is how Honeywell ranks in comparison to those: Healthcare is good, it is categorized as an HDHP, but from the other places I worked, the Deductible and Out-Of-Pocket-Maximums are actually more in-line with other PPOs than HDHPs. The coverage for medicines and other stuff is better than most PPOs from other providers (this is coming from someone who has experience with family members that have chronic health issues). Work Environment: Very laid back, though this is likely dependent on your direct manager, my manager is awesome. Though dress code and stuff seems to be relaxed. I've seen people dressed up all the way to t-shirt and jeans. If you are in doubt on your first day, then go with some slacks and a polo. Hours: This depends on the job, but Honeywell is a global organization so you may work with people in different timezones. I have an early meeting typically, but management accurately adjusts expectations on end of day and arrival at the office. In-Office/Hybrid/Remote: I work in a \"hybrid\" role, and it is pretty awesome. I go into the office 3 days a week and work from home 2 days a week (though I typically work in a coffee shop on those days). This helps greatly because I live about 45 minutes away, so I don't have to commute every day. Either way, my manager is awesome and understanding of my time, as well as everyone I have come into contact with. The office is awesome IMO, has a cafeteria and is a nice quiet environment. If you enjoy your job and you are a hard worker, you will likely have 0 problems with this. 401K Benefits: Good, though the match only happens lump sum at the end of the year, so something to keep in mind if you are not planning on sticking around. Time-Off: I came from a \"Startup\" with an \"unlimited\" time off policy, which sadly just means you fall behind if you take time off, from what I have seen at Honeywell so far (at least by my manager), they legit make you feel comfortable with requesting time off. My manager has already told me multiple times, \"Just let me know if you need some time off\". The first day I started I let them know that I needed to a day off in like two months to go to a wedding and they asked if I needed more than just a day, which is the sign of a good manager! Either way, as with a lot of jobs, a lot of it depends on your manager. I would recommend that during your interviews, ensure you mesh well with your direct manager. A little advice, never think you are being interviewed for a job, always go into an interview with the primary purpose of you interviewing the job. If you are good at your job, you likely don't have an issue with getting one; use this to your advantage. The second I met with my manager, I knew we meshed pretty well as we had a similar background. I then met with their manager and a few other higher ups, and they all had a technical background and seemed very understanding. I look forwards to my future years with the company!",
