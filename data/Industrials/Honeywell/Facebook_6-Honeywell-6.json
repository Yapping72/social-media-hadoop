With No R&D, and buying anyone they can get their hands on to make up for it, they have not really produced ANYTHING in the building controls industry worth a good wet fart. Their motto in the 80s were \"Our people are our most valuable asset\", but with Cote pulling down ungodly bonuses while they cut back more and more on the little guys pay and benefits, the motto should be changed to \"Our stockholders are our most valuable asset\". The ACS division is so worried about anyone taking the little share of market they have left, that they lock down their controls as tight as possible to make it as hard as hell for other companies to take over their jobs, which are very poorly maintained and serviced. My feelings on this company: the ACS division of Honeywell is a poor choice for anyone looking for building automation.

There were a lot of talented people in the company that were great resources for young engineers to learn from, but they have almost all left the company at this point.", "cons": "After the Honeywell purchase, I had concern about layoffs. After speaking to several people that had been through their own Honeywell acquisitions, the consensus was they would make some leadership changes, but keep most everyone else on payroll. BUT I was also told \"people will just leave.\" I thought this to be an interesting statement, yet it has proven to be 100% accurate. Over the years following the acquisition, all the senior leadership was replaced with corporate lackeys that did not share the previous management style that had fostered the tremendous growth of the company and sense of belonging for employees. Gone were the friendly and engaged conversations between upper management and lower level employees, replaced with the corporate BS so commonplace in multinationals like Honeywell. Honeywell is 100% focused on shareholder satisfaction, and 0% of employees. Townhall after townhall meeting employee concerns were dismissed, and well respected employees (including company founders) that had departed were badmouthed by high-level speakers. Company focus shifting to shareholder satisfaction over customer satisfaction meant the quality of product and support of products suffered substantially. Intelligrated always prided itself on being \u201cone of the most desirable places to work in Cincinnati.\u201d Interestingly, post-Honeywell the 3rd party surveys were no longer distributed.\r\nAs far as compensation goes, base pay was decent. Profit sharing had been part of compensation pre-Honeywell, but it was taken away. 401k matching went up(marginally) to a pretty decent level, BUT only if you remained for the entire year. Vesting went from day 1 to 3 years. Vacation went from a standard years-of-service based increase to \u201cunlimited\u201d vacation. Most people handled this reasonably, and continued to take similar time off, but some individuals took advantage of the situation. This prompted departmental changes to limit the unlimited vacation, directly against the corporate policy. It also meant that you would no longer get vacation paid out if it was remaining when you left the company. Raises also mostly became mostly non-existent. Very limited pools of money were made available for managers to distribute to their employees, so even exemplary performance would net a raise barely equal to cost-of-living increases.\r\nAs far as actual working conditions, these started high, but have been moving (quickly) in a downward direction since Honeywell. There were a number of large projects that were handled by my group, and while some of these required lots of extra working hours, the premium pay compensation was decent. I left before the new policy of 48+ went into effect. When I started we were 100% domestic and had great working relationships with other engineering groups throughout the country. The Honeywell changes pushed a lot of engineering efforts to \u201cLQRs\u201d (low quality regions), and that relegated domestic engineers to be project managers with constantly changing \u201cresources\u201d based in India. Constantly changing team members meant a big reduction in productivity, and many projects could not be completed on schedule due to bringing the new people up to speed almost weekly. There was also a big difference in the quality of work and vested interest in the product. I signed up to be a design engineer, not a project manager, so that change was a big negative for me. There was a constant battle between product engineers and \u201ccost out\u201d(make it in China) engineers that wanted to cheapen up the products, without regard for the quality of the finished product. Components were looked at singly, rather than at a system level. The cost-out work(including very nasty \u201cnegotiations\u201d over pricing) resulted in many longstanding great working relationships with suppliers being destroyed. One specific example from a 15+ year supplier was \u201cdon\u2019t ever f-ing call me again.\u201d There were also wedges pushed between the different product groups, with favoritism being overtly blatant. Only managers pets got promotions; everyone else was stagnated in position. The only options were lateral moves to work on different products, or to other engineering groups.\r\nIn short, Honeywell destroyed the company that I had fully planned on retiring from, and I have a number of years of work remaining. I wish others still remaining there the best of luck, but would suggest looking elsewhere for a company that cares about it\u2019s employees. I have been overwhelmingly happy since leaving; I knew I didn\u2019t like it there, but didn\u2019t fully realize how bad it was until I left."}, {"review_title": "Great Experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Feb 2021", "job_title": "TAM in Charlotte, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of available support staff", "cons": "Hard to navigate a rapidly changing environment"}, {"review_title": "Good exposure", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Project Lead", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Customer Handling \r\nDocumentations exposure and design experience", "cons": "Extra hours\r\nTravel frequency \r\nThat\u2019s it"}, {"review_title": "not recommend", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "14 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Senior Materials Management Analyst in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "salary is competitive in general if you work in the aerospace industry", "cons": "other than salary, nothing else is worth talking"}, {"review_title": "Mixed", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Project Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice people, good office location", "cons": "Not enough responsibility, slow moving"}, {"review_title": "System Engineer", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "25 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Senior Applications Engineer in Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "brand, salary, reputation, culture, job security", "cons": "less time with family, too much pressure from the managment"}, {"review_title": "Honeywell Method", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "13 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Principal Scientist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Well established brand\r\nLong history of developing, starting up and supporting new technologies\r\nA field service rotation, starting-up commercial units, is part of the newly graduated ChE's training", "cons": "Company is currently focusing on new technologies outside of core knowledge.\r\nPrimary customers, oil & gas and chemical industry, are currently depressed."}, {"review_title": "going down", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "paid overtime if proved by management", "cons": "people are leaving all the time"}], [{"review_title": "Good Interview Process", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "31 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Systems Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice people, very laid back interview", "cons": "Industry not a great fit"}, {"review_title": "opportunity for growth", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Quality Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "decent reward, training and development", "cons": "limited local opportunities for progress."}, {"review_title": "Honeywell Aerospace", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "14 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Senior Advanced project engineer in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Plenty of opportunities to grow.

With No R&D, and buying anyone they can get their hands on to make up for it, they have not really produced ANYTHING in the building controls industry worth a good wet fart. Their motto in the 80s were \"Our people are our most valuable asset\", but with Cote pulling down ungodly bonuses while they cut back more and more on the little guys pay and benefits, the motto should be changed to \"Our stockholders are our most valuable asset\". The ACS division is so worried about anyone taking the little share of market they have left, that they lock down their controls as tight as possible to make it as hard as hell for other companies to take over their jobs, which are very poorly maintained and serviced. My feelings on this company: the ACS division of Honeywell is a poor choice for anyone looking for building automation.

There were a lot of talented people in the company that were great resources for young engineers to learn from, but they have almost all left the company at this point.", "cons": "After the Honeywell purchase, I had concern about layoffs. After speaking to several people that had been through their own Honeywell acquisitions, the consensus was they would make some leadership changes, but keep most everyone else on payroll. BUT I was also told \"people will just leave.\" I thought this to be an interesting statement, yet it has proven to be 100% accurate. Over the years following the acquisition, all the senior leadership was replaced with corporate lackeys that did not share the previous management style that had fostered the tremendous growth of the company and sense of belonging for employees. Gone were the friendly and engaged conversations between upper management and lower level employees, replaced with the corporate BS so commonplace in multinationals like Honeywell. Honeywell is 100% focused on shareholder satisfaction, and 0% of employees. Townhall after townhall meeting employee concerns were dismissed, and well respected employees (including company founders) that had departed were badmouthed by high-level speakers. Company focus shifting to shareholder satisfaction over customer satisfaction meant the quality of product and support of products suffered substantially. Intelligrated always prided itself on being \u201cone of the most desirable places to work in Cincinnati.\u201d Interestingly, post-Honeywell the 3rd party surveys were no longer distributed.\r\nAs far as compensation goes, base pay was decent. Profit sharing had been part of compensation pre-Honeywell, but it was taken away. 401k matching went up(marginally) to a pretty decent level, BUT only if you remained for the entire year. Vesting went from day 1 to 3 years. Vacation went from a standard years-of-service based increase to \u201cunlimited\u201d vacation. Most people handled this reasonably, and continued to take similar time off, but some individuals took advantage of the situation. This prompted departmental changes to limit the unlimited vacation, directly against the corporate policy. It also meant that you would no longer get vacation paid out if it was remaining when you left the company. Raises also mostly became mostly non-existent. Very limited pools of money were made available for managers to distribute to their employees, so even exemplary performance would net a raise barely equal to cost-of-living increases.\r\nAs far as actual working conditions, these started high, but have been moving (quickly) in a downward direction since Honeywell. There were a number of large projects that were handled by my group, and while some of these required lots of extra working hours, the premium pay compensation was decent. I left before the new policy of 48+ went into effect. When I started we were 100% domestic and had great working relationships with other engineering groups throughout the country. The Honeywell changes pushed a lot of engineering efforts to \u201cLQRs\u201d (low quality regions), and that relegated domestic engineers to be project managers with constantly changing \u201cresources\u201d based in India. Constantly changing team members meant a big reduction in productivity, and many projects could not be completed on schedule due to bringing the new people up to speed almost weekly. There was also a big difference in the quality of work and vested interest in the product. I signed up to be a design engineer, not a project manager, so that change was a big negative for me. There was a constant battle between product engineers and \u201ccost out\u201d(make it in China) engineers that wanted to cheapen up the products, without regard for the quality of the finished product. Components were looked at singly, rather than at a system level. The cost-out work(including very nasty \u201cnegotiations\u201d over pricing) resulted in many longstanding great working relationships with suppliers being destroyed. One specific example from a 15+ year supplier was \u201cdon\u2019t ever f-ing call me again.\u201d There were also wedges pushed between the different product groups, with favoritism being overtly blatant. Only managers pets got promotions; everyone else was stagnated in position. The only options were lateral moves to work on different products, or to other engineering groups.\r\nIn short, Honeywell destroyed the company that I had fully planned on retiring from, and I have a number of years of work remaining.
