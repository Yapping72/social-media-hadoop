Honywell calls the long term vision the next quarter and only cares about the stock price and will do anything to keep the stock price high. When orders don't come it, then you just lay off another 10% of your workforce. It does not matter that this means that you can no longer execute projects in execution, because that will not show yet in the next quarter, where sales have projected they will triple their numbers. When due to the pandemic that does not happen, HON just terminates these sales folks and replaces them with juniors that haven't got a clue about what they are selling. Yet we call it \"Customer Success Organisation\". It is a recipe for disaster and senior management only believes their own lies. Instead of focusing on engineering, the culture is now focusing on \"compliance\" with rules nobody in engineering understands but that have to be entered as a mandatory goal for performance reviews. UOP used to be an american company that thought and acted globally. They have evolved to a global company that cares about the US only and is oblivious to what is happening in the rest of the world yet are convinced the rest of the world fully embraces American culture, values and traditions."

Had several years with 0% raise as well as several furloughs during my time working there, effectively lowering my pay. Aside from promotions (which were very rare), my pay barely kept up with inflation. All the while the company was still increasing profits and giving huge salaries to the ever-expanding upper management.\r\n - CONSTANT management/corporate shake-ups and changes in the reporting structure. So much so that often times I had no idea who my manager was a couple levels up without going and investigating the org chart.\r\n - While I was there, our group was moved within the company reporting structure no less than 4 times. Between myself and the CEO were at least 9 managers. It seemed like there was nearly 1 manager for every 2 employees.\r\n - Management created and constantly pushed initiatives that would stifle our ability to work. We couldn't just make a product without spending 8 months reviewing, discussing, and making changes to appease all 9 of the managers for the product. Frequently, a manager wouldn't pay attention to the product until it was well within development, and would then start pushing changes.\r\n - The things we did make were not thought out to a reasonable degree. Marketing would hear from a single customer a feature or product they'd like. Marketing would push this to engineering and we'd go through months of planning and development. Input from actual engineers saying that the thing they want is impractical, or useful only to that specific customer would be ignored. When we finally get a product out, nobody would buy it.\r\n - Strong push to move as much to India as possible. I loved the team from India that I worked with and I am still friends with some of them. But the company seems to want to push all major development there even when it doesn't make sense. Management also seemed to try to \"hide\" how many of the projects were being sent to India. There were several instances where we would find out that a team in India was working on a new project that integrates with something we created/maintain, or were working on copies of products that we made. We'd discover this because one of their engineers would get stuck and email us asking for help on something we created; we'd find out they're 6 months into, and struggling with, developing a product that we likely could've made ourselves in 2 months or that we could have at least shared some initial knowledge about to speed up the project for the other team. I believe this was the case because there was different reporting structures for the US and IN teams, and there were people in upper management that could make themselves look good by throwing a ton of projects over the wall to IN and then showing off how much work they got done, regardless of marketability, profitability, or quality of the products that were made. I do not blame the IN engineers for this, it was purely bad management and the IN teams absolutely could've been utilized in better ways."

Top heavy with bloated management and their salaries. Never enough time, people, or money to do it right the first time. But, always enough time, people, and money to do three of four more times."

You will get laid off without a written notice for legal purposes. Team leads are very prideful and there are constant talks about politics. Those with other views are shunned from speaking or even getting good assignments. You cannot work a flat 40 hours, there are unwritten rules about working more than 15% of that. You WILL get scolded by every manager you have for working 40 hours only. You DO NOT get unlimited vacation, I repeat it is not unlimited vacation. It is entirely determined by your manager, whether you have vacation or not. This is one reason why I joined but sad to see where things have gone.\r\n\r\nThe Aerospace business outlook is very grim and I will be surprised if it survives another year without being sold off."

Honywell calls the long term vision the next quarter and only cares about the stock price and will do anything to keep the stock price high. When orders don't come it, then you just lay off another 10% of your workforce. It does not matter that this means that you can no longer execute projects in execution, because that will not show yet in the next quarter, where sales have projected they will triple their numbers. When due to the pandemic that does not happen, HON just terminates these sales folks and replaces them with juniors that haven't got a clue about what they are selling. Yet we call it \"Customer Success Organisation\". It is a recipe for disaster and senior management only believes their own lies. Instead of focusing on engineering, the culture is now focusing on \"compliance\" with rules nobody in engineering understands but that have to be entered as a mandatory goal for performance reviews. UOP used to be an american company that thought and acted globally. They have evolved to a global company that cares about the US only and is oblivious to what is happening in the rest of the world yet are convinced the rest of the world fully embraces American culture, values and traditions."

		"cons": "- Hiring and promotions based on relationships and not skills.\r\n- Stagnant pay. Expect 1-3% raise per year, at most. Had several years with 0% raise as well as several furloughs during my time working there, effectively lowering my pay. Aside from promotions (which were very rare), my pay barely kept up with inflation. All the while the company was still increasing profits and giving huge salaries to the ever-expanding upper management.\r\n - CONSTANT management/corporate shake-ups and changes in the reporting structure. So much so that often times I had no idea who my manager was a couple levels up without going and investigating the org chart.\r\n - While I was there, our group was moved within the company reporting structure no less than 4 times. Between myself and the CEO were at least 9 managers. It seemed like there was nearly 1 manager for every 2 employees.\r\n - Management created and constantly pushed initiatives that would stifle our ability to work. We couldn't just make a product without spending 8 months reviewing, discussing, and making changes to appease all 9 of the managers for the product. Frequently, a manager wouldn't pay attention to the product until it was well within development, and would then start pushing changes.\r\n - The things we did make were not thought out to a reasonable degree. Marketing would hear from a single customer a feature or product they'd like. Marketing would push this to engineering and we'd go through months of planning and development. Input from actual engineers saying that the thing they want is impractical, or useful only to that specific customer would be ignored. When we finally get a product out, nobody would buy it.\r\n - Strong push to move as much to India as possible. I loved the team from India that I worked with and I am still friends with some of them. But the company seems to want to push all major development there even when it doesn't make sense. Management also seemed to try to \"hide\" how many of the projects were being sent to India. There were several instances where we would find out that a team in India was working on a new project that integrates with something we created/maintain, or were working on copies of products that we made. We'd discover this because one of their engineers would get stuck and email us asking for help on something we created; we'd find out they're 6 months into, and struggling with, developing a product that we likely could've made ourselves in 2 months or that we could have at least shared some initial knowledge about to speed up the project for the other team. I believe this was the case because there was different reporting structures for the US and IN teams, and there were people in upper management that could make themselves look good by throwing a ton of projects over the wall to IN and then showing off how much work they got done, regardless of marketability, profitability, or quality of the products that were made. I do not blame the IN engineers for this, it was purely bad management and the IN teams absolutely could've been utilized in better ways."
