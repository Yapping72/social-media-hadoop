Dashboards are very easy to use and all information is right there.  Town hall meetings and employee mingles are also very helpful especially for younger works who might want to transfer into new opportunities. Benefits are also pretty good compare to the rest of companies and overall management (at least in sourcing) is very understanding of family situations.",

The other 50% create additional work to follow up with the rest, power point pushers, which takes away focus from real work.  A lot of conflicting metrics and constant direction changes.  Not sure if management outside of Intelligrated really understands project type of business. You can not design your supply chain for project/engineering same as supply chain for safety glasses/gloves.  Metrics are very important in a big company; however, the most important metric is to service our installation sites/plants and internal customers.  Good customer service/quick turn around is exactly why Intelligrated grew from nothing.  Lets try not to lose that niche."

There are no community areas to meet as a team and there isn't time for collaboration, brainstorming and sharing ideas. \n- The only behavior that is truly rewarded is \"getting the product shipped\" \n- Several silos and there is plenty of bad blood across teams. \n- Two unpaid 1-week furloughs in 6 months and layoffs just announced for August 2016.

I was told in person by HR, \"we dont know how to interpret your military transcripts\". I have high level troubleshooting skills that i learned in military where I have real world troubleshooting experience in avionics. Yet, because I do not have an AAS 2 year degree (I already have an Associates of Arts AA)I cannot even get an INTERVIEW with my own employer. They will hire you based on the tax credits they get, but have no interest in promoting you with in. Even if you have far beyond what they are asking for. In the last month hey just let go 7 personnel in management, and they also didnt award any annual pay raises for the merit based jobs.

It's seen as a negative aspect if you're not working that ~45 hours or more. Health insurance isn't very good at all, and raises at the end of the year aren't higher than 2-3%, and that's if you're lucky. The moral is very very low because of how the company treats the employees, and that drives a lot of people to other companies and to retire earlier than planned. The process of getting promoted is very difficult as well. You have to wait for your manager (and other higher ups) to open up a job req, you have to apply, fully interview, and be \"selected\". Promotions don't happen very often so people just leave the company or move groups to move up. People who transfer into the company from other companies also get paid 5-15k more than someone in the same position that's been at the company from the start so there's a large pay gap between people doing the same jobs."

Further, nearly all non-manufacturing employees had to take 2 weeks of unpaid furlough so far this year (we expect to be asked to take another by the end of the year). There have also been 2 rounds of layoffs this year with another round coming in November. The icing on the cake is the new Aerospace Remote Working policy that basically eliminates that option for nearly all Aerospace employees. The ability to work remote at least part of the week in an area that suffers from extreme traffic congestion was a huge perk that is now being revoked. It is the last straw for many of my colleagues. While many other companies are ditching the traditional 40 hour work week at the office in favor of more flexible schedules and telecommuting options, Honeywell once again proves just how out of touch it is with technology and today\u2019s workforce. How does the company expect to attract and retain top talent with such outdated, old school thinking?  It\u2019s a shame because the products people work on in Aerospace are pretty cool, but that cool factor only goes so far."

I feel that I have a direct responsiblity to make my team successful with the clear goals that my manager provides. I feel challenged in the work that I do because of the aggressive goals that I am asked to meet. It makes the reward (often small monetary \"bravo\" bonuses) feel earned.",
		"cons": "Many people are often expected to know more than your job description initially entailed. People work beyond their strong knowledge areas and often is harder on them and not as rewarding as it may not be where their interests lie. I believe that this eats away at morale due to the time it takes people away from their friends and family outside of work. Because we are global there is a lot of time spent doing these heavy workloads outside of normal office hours. As these resources hit burnout and leave, we are unable to hire externally in many cases which only increases the burden on current employees or forces us to hire internally from a pool of resources that might not be the most qualified for that position. I know this isn't the case in all of the Honeywell groups, so take this with a grain of salt."

In general for production they don't get employees involved before making changes to the processes or procedures. If you're in a position that you're over qualified for or any other reason you may want to leave. The hiring manager has the right to keep you in that position until 18 months to avoid the hassle of finding someone else internally regardless of how unhappy you're in your current role.  HR can't assist no matter how unhappy you're. If going for a technical or engineering role, avoid Production and Customer Repair Center if possible.  This has the least amount of experienced managers, unprofessional environments (in a bad way), and is overall the most avoided areas when you ask around the company. Go with recommendation from the Pro section. Also, Health Insurance... you're better off going privately.  This company doesn't like to invest money into it's employees, future, or maintaining current environments until a failure or major situation occurs."

We've pretty much alienated every major customer we have through late deliveries, poor quality product releases and refusal to fix product and promised functionality to meet original commitments. Engineering has lost most if not all of their momentum budgets so funding to address issues or opportunities  that crop up unexpectedly is doled out scrouge-like if at all. Hiring to meet only committed projects makes accomplishing off plan efforts that ARE funded dicey at best.\r\n\r\nLoss of production resources, software engineering and increasingly systems engineering is pointing to a company goal focused on managing products rather than engineering products.\r\n\r\nVery little new development engineering on the horizon."

I have also seen Honeywell make a special job position and title for one employee just because they had no where to advance but then refuse to do it for other individuals. You are required to go to company meetings (on their time!) and also to take certain self improvement and training courses. Honeywell is a very buracratic company that does things just because that is the way it has always been done. The culture is, right or wrong, do as you are told and do not say anything otherwise you will labeled as a \"trouble maker\"."

Let's create a new position and elevate one of his cronies. Yes, it is that simple. \r\n4. If you are a woman, I am not sure this is the place for you. Recruiters are known to ask about pregnancy plans (I believe this is Gurgaon specific again). One of the managers in Gurgaon refused to entertain an existing female employee's  application to move to his team because she was in a live-in relationship with her husband (also an employee) before marriage.  \r\n4.

There is no on-site IT support for computer or printer issues.  I can't even use the garbage can in my cube for food waste because they don't pick up garbage every night so all food waste has to go in the central garbage.  \n\nThey have no consideration for quality of life or work / life balance.  Telecommuting regularly is no longer allowed.  Health or child care facilities are not available on-site.  The only common space is the cafeteria, so socializing is difficult.

Not all departments are like this, though. Aerospace hours tracking is typical for the industry (down to 6-minute increments). I've since moved to a company that doesn't track hours at all, it's very refreshing.\r\n\r\nTorrance is mostly older people. Everyone's very competent, but there's no social environment there. People clock out and go straight home.\r\n\r\nNo promotions unless you transfer to another department to get it. They are happy to let you do one job for 30+ years and never give more than a COL raise. That said, if you're looking for that sort of stability, it's there."

Huge emphasis on safety & improvement ideas, but this is only to pad the metrics for a manager or director. Immediate supervisor really clueless and rarely gives positive feedback. Very demoralizing environment. With the current management it will never realize it's full potential.\r\nThe current HOS system is a one size fits all and no one there has the guts to tell Mr Cote that guess what, one size does not fit all. I guess that when you have dysfunctional management you cannot trust them to run the show so you have to come up with an act that will satisfy the shareholders. Touche Mr Cote.

There\u2019s more of a \u201clet\u2019s see how much we can get out of them before they quit mentality\u201d here. The irony is the surprise when certain areas of the company experience high turnover. It\u2019s a pretty clear indicator of a bad company when you can\u2019t get anyone to accept or interview for positions on your team because your reputation is so bad.\r\n\r\nAlso work from home is a pretty standard modern benefit. Good companies allow it because they trust their employees and know that it encourages employee retention and productivity. You guessed it. Honeywell no longer allows work from home without a prohibitive and antiquated review and approval process. It\u2019s ridiculous and the reasons given for eliminating this benefit were crap! Team building, productivity, blah, blah. Maybe when we\u2019re required to work overtime on our personal time we should cite the work from home policy and refuse since technically we can\u2019t work from home?

In general, most of the work you get to do here will have some global impact and in keeping with that you'll get exposure to a diverse, global workforce. Hiring policies are conservative - this means tight headcount control, but positions are generally safe compared to other organizations which go overboard hiring people who mere months later will be on the street again. Read a 2010-ish HBR article in which the Honeywell CEO articulates his rationale for furloughing employees during the 2008 downturn very well - as opposed to engaging in the perpetual layoff-rehire cycle so characteristic elsewhere. Kudos!",
		"cons": "Much of the organization is acquisition based rather than homegrown. Core pieces of knowledge and process assets are seldom centralized and remain at the periphery, i.e. the acquired lines of business. At the same time the company has poor vertical and horizontal alignment. Vertically, a towering stack of middle management levels (last I counted 9 between me and the CEO) leads to diffuse responsibility but maintains a surprisingly authoritarian command and control approach. Horizontally this is matched by extreme silo formation. Management longevity is poor. At some point in my career I had to deal with a veritable revolving door of supervisors (and their supervisors, and so forth)."

Half the people in my class did not understand the basics of statistics, problem solving, etc. \r\n- More meetings with people who did not contribute a single comment, take responsibility for an action, or otherwise participate.

The top management has been changing regularly, with very limited opportunities for other employees to advance in the organization. I believe that if you do not have a big sponsor or you do not play back-channel politics nowadays, there is no way for you to advance in the organization.

Management made it look as if everyone gets a chance and that you can get started quick after a year with the company, but they have made it impossible for me to obtain approvals to continue studying in related fields (after more than 2 years) and in cases where I have had the opportunity to grow and learn from other design tools I have been slamed with a no for an answer in front of other peers.

It was like getting an early Christmas present each year when HR announced the requisite 4-5% cost increase, with the corresponding pay freeze (of course).  The cost of Obamacare was rapidly converging with this massive corporation's medical benefits and it's only a matter of time before it becomes cheaper.\r\n\r\nYou will also receive the privilege of learning how to perfect beuracracy and spend endless hours making meaningless powerpoint slides, better known internally as the \"journey to HOS Gold\".\r\n\r\nSeriously, if you are considering a position here, you've been warned.

		"cons": "Honeywell is so big that it can be a huge city by itself. There are so many different business units that you will be easily overwhelmed. You can be seated next to a person that is not related at all with the products you work on. There are lots of changes in the company, budget stuff and people that have left, but there's also lots of people trying to improve things. I picture Honeywell as a giant trojan horse with lots of people inside it, trying to move everything as fast as they can, but the world already has rockets and space ships. It's very bureaucratic. No parking space for newbies in Mexico City, it's full."

Many long term employees are a wealth of knowledge that should be shared with others. Tools provided by Honeywell to manage results/metrics are simply excellent. Dashboards are very easy to use and all information is right there.  Town hall meetings and employee mingles are also very helpful especially for younger works who might want to transfer into new opportunities. Benefits are also pretty good compare to the rest of companies and overall management (at least in sourcing) is very understanding of family situations.",

The other 50% create additional work to follow up with the rest, power point pushers, which takes away focus from real work.  A lot of conflicting metrics and constant direction changes.  Not sure if management outside of Intelligrated really understands project type of business. You can not design your supply chain for project/engineering same as supply chain for safety glasses/gloves.  Metrics are very important in a big company; however, the most important metric is to service our installation sites/plants and internal customers.  Good customer service/quick turn around is exactly why Intelligrated grew from nothing.  Lets try not to lose that niche."

Once the daily meetings are over, everyone returns to their desks and communicates through email. There are no community areas to meet as a team and there isn't time for collaboration, brainstorming and sharing ideas. \n- The only behavior that is truly rewarded is \"getting the product shipped\" \n- Several silos and there is plenty of bad blood across teams. \n- Two unpaid 1-week furloughs in 6 months and layoffs just announced for August 2016.

It's seen as a negative aspect if you're not working that ~45 hours or more. Health insurance isn't very good at all, and raises at the end of the year aren't higher than 2-3%, and that's if you're lucky. The moral is very very low because of how the company treats the employees, and that drives a lot of people to other companies and to retire earlier than planned. The process of getting promoted is very difficult as well. You have to wait for your manager (and other higher ups) to open up a job req, you have to apply, fully interview, and be \"selected\". Promotions don't happen very often so people just leave the company or move groups to move up. People who transfer into the company from other companies also get paid 5-15k more than someone in the same position that's been at the company from the start so there's a large pay gap between people doing the same jobs."

		"pros": "The Aerospace product lines are high impact and wide-reaching, so the work can be rewarding. Benefits are decent for vested employees, but not great. My advice: get your start here to gain experience in the field, but don't stay longer than 5 years.",
		"cons": "While the stock prices rise, and the CEO rakes in over $20M, Honeywell Aerospace employees did not receive raises in 2016. Further, nearly all non-manufacturing employees had to take 2 weeks of unpaid furlough so far this year (we expect to be asked to take another by the end of the year). There have also been 2 rounds of layoffs this year with another round coming in November. The icing on the cake is the new Aerospace Remote Working policy that basically eliminates that option for nearly all Aerospace employees. The ability to work remote at least part of the week in an area that suffers from extreme traffic congestion was a huge perk that is now being revoked. It is the last straw for many of my colleagues. While many other companies are ditching the traditional 40 hour work week at the office in favor of more flexible schedules and telecommuting options, Honeywell once again proves just how out of touch it is with technology and today\u2019s workforce. How does the company expect to attract and retain top talent with such outdated, old school thinking?  It\u2019s a shame because the products people work on in Aerospace are pretty cool, but that cool factor only goes so far."

		"pros": "Honeywell gives employees great opportunity to travel around the world when necessary to visit co-sources in other countries or team members that you have worked with virtually. There is so much work on conference calls that you lose the people connection so traveling is a key component. I like the way Honeywell enables managers to direct their own resources. I feel that I have a direct responsiblity to make my team successful with the clear goals that my manager provides. I feel challenged in the work that I do because of the aggressive goals that I am asked to meet. It makes the reward (often small monetary \"bravo\" bonuses) feel earned.",
		"cons": "Many people are often expected to know more than your job description initially entailed. People work beyond their strong knowledge areas and often is harder on them and not as rewarding as it may not be where their interests lie. I believe that this eats away at morale due to the time it takes people away from their friends and family outside of work. Because we are global there is a lot of time spent doing these heavy workloads outside of normal office hours. As these resources hit burnout and leave, we are unable to hire externally in many cases which only increases the burden on current employees or forces us to hire internally from a pool of resources that might not be the most qualified for that position. I know this isn't the case in all of the Honeywell groups, so take this with a grain of salt."

The hiring manager has the right to keep you in that position until 18 months to avoid the hassle of finding someone else internally regardless of how unhappy you're in your current role.  HR can't assist no matter how unhappy you're. If going for a technical or engineering role, avoid Production and Customer Repair Center if possible.  This has the least amount of experienced managers, unprofessional environments (in a bad way), and is overall the most avoided areas when you ask around the company. Go with recommendation from the Pro section. Also, Health Insurance... you're better off going privately.

		"pros": "Benefits are excellent (vacation, holidays, personal days, 401k, medical, dental and eye, long and short  term disability, life insurance, etc.). They also pay for your education.  I got two degrees while working for Honeywell.  Honeywell Aerospace is one of the last to have layoffs when the economy is not doing very well. The company is financially strong. They have never been underfunded in their retirement fund.\r\nManagement is very good at telling everyone what is going on with the company, where they stand and where they are heading in the future. There is a cafeteria open all day as well as a company store.",
		"cons": "I do not care who gets hired for a job just as long as they are better qualified than others applying for the same position. To meet their \"quota\" they tend to favor minorities when hiring even when they are not fully qualified or as qualified as many applying. I have witness this several times. I have also seen Honeywell make a special job position and title for one employee just because they had no where to advance but then refuse to do it for other individuals. You are required to go to company meetings (on their time!) and also to take certain self improvement and training courses. Honeywell is a very buracratic company that does things just because that is the way it has always been done. The culture is, right or wrong, do as you are told and do not say anything otherwise you will labeled as a \"trouble maker\"."

Let's create a new position and elevate one of his cronies. Yes, it is that simple. \r\n4. If you are a woman, I am not sure this is the place for you. Recruiters are known to ask about pregnancy plans (I believe this is Gurgaon specific again). One of the managers in Gurgaon refused to entertain an existing female employee's  application to move to his team because she was in a live-in relationship with her husband (also an employee) before marriage.  \r\n4. Men get away with a lot of behaviour that a woman may not. I have seen a male team leader yell at his team member in front of the entire team and perform poorly and yet, get away it. Try that as a woman and you have a behaviour problem."

I can't even use the garbage can in my cube for food waste because they don't pick up garbage every night so all food waste has to go in the central garbage.  \n\nThey have no consideration for quality of life or work / life balance.

Writing is on the wall you have to go. PIP is used as a tool for RIF. Be cautious after  completing one year. its about surviving year after year. Be careful with the Mid-Term, essentially you get a bad mid term even if you do your best your annual appraisal will be  really bad. The management is using PIP as a tool to show the door even though your team is doing overall good. Check your manager behavior if he is ought to get  its better to leave the company and look for a job elsewhere. Even your past good records will be ignored if placed under PIP.

The pay is terrible for the industry, as it always has been,  but the benefits that made it worthwhile have completely disappeared in the last five years.  80 hour workweeks while abroad with no vacation nor holidays is the norm.  FOS managers are petty and will spite people they talk to three times a year like children.  The FOS managers also lie to other managers among the company to keep their shady practices under wraps.  The management is now all in the Honeywell mindset, which will simply not work for this type of company.  When field workers charging thousands a day to the customers are begging the customers for transportation, translators, and food, unlike any other licensor out there, it is embarrassing."

Too much money is spent on the senior employees who do not deliver much and not many oppurtunitites for a fresher in the company. The kind of work you do, does not align with your interests. It is just pure luck! There is a lack of life in office, due to lack of energetic and young people. What else can you expect when there are so many oldies in the campany... Work environment SUCKS!!"

Huge emphasis on safety & improvement ideas, but this is only to pad the metrics for a manager or director. Immediate supervisor really clueless and rarely gives positive feedback. Very demoralizing environment. With the current management it will never realize it's full potential.\r\nThe current HOS system is a one size fits all and no one there has the guts to tell Mr Cote that guess what, one size does not fit all.

You should be ready to accept that almost all the managerial positions, or lead positions, are occupied by either a bengali or a chennai guy...performance evaluation and yearly appraisals are 100% biased....managers are technically absolutely incompetent, and only knows dirty politics to insure getting THEIR (bengali/south indian) guys in key positions....they themselves got to managerial positions without working at all!!....if you are a bengali or a south indian candidate, then this is your place (mecca)....others, pl do not waste your time....one entire technology center has ALL the candidates coming from south india!!....even the anonymous feedbacks aren't anonymous, and the next day your manager would talk to you about the feedback...managers nominate THEIR guys for good assignments, or career progression....everything is evident, but no one could do anything about this.... managers are enjoying easy money with collaborative political efforts, and screwing lives of working level engineers....it sums up to the fact that the managers in gurgaon office are absolutely not adding any value to this company...very unfortunate for a prestigious organization."

The people are great and treat each other great. Lots of activities going on for everyone like Language Training, Lead Training, Customer Handling Training and Fun activities like Festival Celebrations, Competitions, Get together and Team Outings.\r\nVery good structure for Awards and Recognition.

		"pros": "Was once a great innovator in Aerospace before Allied Signal acquired Honeywell and turned it into Honey-Ah-Lied.  Still has some great engineers for new grads to work with, but very little new development to learn from, as management wants to \"milk\" the old products rather than invest in new development..  Benefits and pay were comparable to other aerospace companies, but the benefits have been steadily eroded for several years, including actual 10% pay cuts in 2009.",
		"cons": "Upper management's entire  focus is to outsource everything to save money -- even if the engineering work and manufactured products coming out of the outsourcing are shoddy.  Upper management takes no responsibility for the product problems and only wants more work outsourced while experienced engineers are laid off or pushed to retire due to benefit cuts.  The company is being driven into the ground by greedy corporate executives who don't contribute any real leadership or vision for the future of the company. The profits generated by all the cost savings go to bloated executive salaries and buying other businesses to pillage.  The first thing the management does after an acquisition is to sell off all the buildings and land of the new business (and lease back the buildings) to pretend that they have made a profit.  Then the outsourcing and layoffs begin, followed by the stifling of any investment in new products.  Basically it's a cannibalistic company, devouring any resources and terminating employees."

Even an individual contributor can average 8 hours of meetings a week, so there are plenty of excuses for falling behind. \r\n\r\nYou don't necessarily need to understand how the product works in order to be a manager, you can just deflect questions to someone else.  Managers don't need to be involved in development if there are lack of resources, their only responsibility is to give opinions at meetings.  Talented people leave the company, so there is plenty of space to move up.\r\n\r\nJob is quite secure.",

No autonomy, no ownership of work.  Pace of development is quite slow.\r\n\r\nCode base is outdated and built on deprecated technologies, very difficult to innovate.\r\n\r\nLots of restrictions on what software you can install, excessive blocking of internet access.\r\n\r\nTechnical excellence doesn't seem to be valued much."

The irony is the surprise when certain areas of the company experience high turnover. It\u2019s a pretty clear indicator of a bad company when you can\u2019t get anyone to accept or interview for positions on your team because your reputation is so bad.\r\n\r\nAlso work from home is a pretty standard modern benefit. Good companies allow it because they trust their employees and know that it encourages employee retention and productivity. You guessed it. Honeywell no longer allows work from home without a prohibitive and antiquated review and approval process. It\u2019s ridiculous and the reasons given for eliminating this benefit were crap! Team building, productivity, blah, blah.

In general, most of the work you get to do here will have some global impact and in keeping with that you'll get exposure to a diverse, global workforce. Hiring policies are conservative - this means tight headcount control, but positions are generally safe compared to other organizations which go overboard hiring people who mere months later will be on the street again. Read a 2010-ish HBR article in which the Honeywell CEO articulates his rationale for furloughing employees during the 2008 downturn very well - as opposed to engaging in the perpetual layoff-rehire cycle so characteristic elsewhere. Kudos!",
		"cons": "Much of the organization is acquisition based rather than homegrown. Core pieces of knowledge and process assets are seldom centralized and remain at the periphery, i.e. the acquired lines of business. At the same time the company has poor vertical and horizontal alignment. Vertically, a towering stack of middle management levels (last I counted 9 between me and the CEO) leads to diffuse responsibility but maintains a surprisingly authoritarian command and control approach. Horizontally this is matched by extreme silo formation. Management longevity is poor. At some point in my career I had to deal with a veritable revolving door of supervisors (and their supervisors, and so forth)."

I had to play the roles of a functional analyst, project manager and support team lead (some long-termers find that very special)\r\n- career path and growth opportunities are hazy\r\n- little or no knowledge retention within the company, since development and support work are done by contract employees\r\n- no co-located teams, since the contract employees work from another city (loners can rejoice)\r\n- colleagues in the USA rarely adjust to IST, so work-life balance goes for a toss\r\n- some colleagues (mostly long in the tooth ones) work long and late to earn brownie points\r\n- no work from home option\r\n- top management is very dense\r\n- HOS Gold is all preach and zero practice\r\n- no travel opportunities\r\n- business analysis is an often ignored and under-developed discipline in the entire organization; BAs steer clear!\r\n- software licences are shared, so you need to keep requesting IT Help Desk to renew/extend it for continued usage"

Unfortunately, several strategic mistakes were made in planning, and this has cost the company millions.\r\n- Six Sigma for most everyone, even if you must fly to another city to be trained. Half the people in my class did not understand the basics of statistics, problem solving, etc. \r\n- More meetings with people who did not contribute a single comment, take responsibility for an action, or otherwise participate. Since many meetings are hosted \"remotely\" (using LiveMeeting or similar tools), often people who should have been listening and participating were busy reading their email or checking their BBs. \r\n- Stated targets for back-office functions (IT, procurement, etc) were based on industry \"best-in-class\" comparisons, but after probing for additional details the basis for these comparisons were never provided."

In fact, I think that the managers are more than the regular employees in the company. The processes became very centralized which led to many organizational dysfunctions. The top management has been changing regularly, with very limited opportunities for other employees to advance in the organization. I believe that if you do not have a big sponsor or you do not play back-channel politics nowadays, there is no way for you to advance in the organization. I agree with the one who said that Honeywell is converting UOP into a software company. A lot of talents left the company, especially those who are competent enough to get jobs in the market."

Management made it look as if everyone gets a chance and that you can get started quick after a year with the company, but they have made it impossible for me to obtain approvals to continue studying in related fields (after more than 2 years) and in cases where I have had the opportunity to grow and learn from other design tools I have been slamed with a no for an answer in front of other peers. (Almost makes it feel like they really didn't want me to grow).\n\nMany employee discounts for PR are irrelevant or outdated to local stores and discounts available are less than half of those in U.S mainland... worst than that... company products offered to employees at a diacounted price are actually cheaper in Amazon for everyone to buy."

Strong focus on high tech products - jet engines and flight guidance/management systems - military and commercial products. There are reasonable training opportunities and a reasonable support for initiatives such as Six Sigma and Lean. If you take the initiative and know what you are doing, build consensus and get the right level of support it is possible to move the needle on things you initiate/believe in  - and not just follow Leadership initiatives. There us a huge gap in the demographics - lots of 20+ year folk, many younger people but few \"middle managers\" in the 10 -15 year range - so opportunnities will be growing as teh old guard retires.",

No respect for company service - they will cram someone with 10, 15, 20 years service in the same cubicle as someone who just joined the company - usually both of them in the same cubicle. Corporate policies are followed only when convenient - rules say you fly business class if a flight is over 8 hours, bosses say \"fly in the back\". Of course this only applies if you don' fly on one of the many corporate jets that the \"leaders\" fly around in."

It was like getting an early Christmas present each year when HR announced the requisite 4-5% cost increase, with the corresponding pay freeze (of course).  The cost of Obamacare was rapidly converging with this massive corporation's medical benefits and it's only a matter of time before it becomes cheaper.\r\n\r\nYou will also receive the privilege of learning how to perfect beuracracy and spend endless hours making meaningless powerpoint slides, better known internally as the \"journey to HOS Gold\".\r\n\r\nSeriously, if you are considering a position here, you've been warned.

It is foolish for executives to believe employees do not know our leaders are looking into the future. They know in advance if actions are needed and yet, they refuse to help their employees by giving as much notice as possible. They don't care. Then to add, a few weeks ago, it was announced no longer remote working was allowed...We just step backed into the 80's. No other fortune 500 company believes in this philosophy. If Honeywell is looking for people to quit to avoid another layoff, they will get it, the problem is their high performing employees will quit and they will be left with what is left."

The only way you'll be able to get an actual pay increase at this company is to switch to a different role. \r\n\r\nLosing experience:\r\n\r\nHoneywell is losing engineers quickly. Mainly due to retirement, and there are no engineers to take their place. There has been no foresight to hire and train people to fill the shoes of these engineering giants as they leave. \r\n\r\nNo guidance/training:\r\n\r\nWhen getting a job here, there is little to no guidance or training on how to preform your new role. I don't think I've actually ever been trained on how to do something at this company. I've had to figure it out myself, or if I'm lucky, I can get someone to reply to one of my emails or answer a call for a few seconds to tell me what needs to be done. \r\n\r\nWork/life balance:\r\n\r\nThere is a constant push from the higher ups to work more. This is tracked and we are constantly urged to put in more hours in order to help Honeywell reduce labor cost and push out contracts quicker."
