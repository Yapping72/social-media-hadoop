Took corporate FOREVER to finally allow work from home during the pandemic compared to other businesses of similar caliber and size. The official plan is to have employees come back to the office 3 days a week starting July 6th, 2021, and then full-time back in the office sometime in the fall, September/October time-frame. With no planned exemptions or flexibility involved. The WFH policy up until this point is essentially \"you can't\" unless you're legally required to be allowed to. They claim that working in the office is better for collaboration and teamwork and innovation, but as an employee both before and after being purchased by Honeywell, I can tell you there is almost NO collaboration or innovation going on, nor is it actually incentivized. They just like the buzzwords.\r\n\r\n- No Upward Mobility\r\n You would think a company like this would be incredibly interested in keeping the younger generation around and attracting young, new talent and retaining them to replace the \"old guard\" when they move on or retire, but they don't remotely care and it's obnoxiously evident. They drag out promotions for nearly a year or more, if you even get one at all. They get incredibly stingy with the raises when they actually do give them. They don't seem interested in giving you a career path, just expect you to be happy you're where you are and to stay there.\r\n\r\n- 401K Paid Out Once Per Year\r\n They only pay 401k match once a year in January, meaning you lose out on potential dividends. interest gains, and general gains over the course of the year that they could have been matching monthly. This also means if you leave at any point other than right after you receive your match, you miss out on potentially 11 months worth of 401k match funds.\r\n\r\n- Furloughs and Cut Cost-of-Living Raises are the Norm\r\n It's very typical to be furloughed, even as an engineer, for anywhere from 1 week to 1 full month every year. That's a lot of time that you can't really plan for to go without a paycheck, and there's no telling when they decide the financials need to look better, so everyone should take one for the team. They also frequently find excuses to not offer the yearly cost-of-living wage increases; Usually it's that the financial performance hasn't been great, despite having just shown slides that seemed an awful lot like the company was doing pretty good.\r\n\r\n- Inefficient, Silo'd Engineering & Lack of Training\r\n Almost all engineering teams work in silos all the time and team collaboration is just handled at the end when it has to be done, instead of integrating things throughout the course of development. There is also little to no training. If you ever do go through training, it's usually way to late to have ever been useful, but the training itself isn't usually actually helpful in the first place so it's really wouldn't matter.\r\n\r\n- Heavy Focus on Short-Term Stockholder Gains\r\n Most of the town-halls and other company-wide meetings usually cover financials from a high-level perspective talking about how great we are usually doing, and quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year financial improvements. As well as how great this would be for the stockholders. This wouldn't be such an issue if it weren't for the people that make the business profitable (the sales teams and the engineering teams) weren't treated as a disposable meat grinder. There is no conversation had about employee retention or what could be helpful to keep employees, giving the impression to back up the evidence, that they couldn't care less whether you stay or go.\r\n\r\n - Lots of Broken Promises\r\n They frequently like to have \"surveys\" that a mysteriously large portion of the company report never receiving and use these surveys to justify the state of things, while making \"promises\" and \"plans\" on how to \"improve\" things that NEVER actually come to fruition in any way more than an abstract \"we should be doing this\" conversation in a town-hall.\r\n\r\n- Hemorrhaging Employees\r\n Employee retention seems to be the last concern to upper-management. I've heard losses of engineering employees described as \"un-regrettable losses\". That speaks for itself."}, {"review_title": "good to start a career", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "29 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Senior Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good work life balance\ngood to start", "cons": "no sabbatical option in the company"}, {"review_title": "Honeywell", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Procurement", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to work, if you're in the right location/demographic", "cons": "you need to fit their mold of emlpoyee to succeed"}, {"review_title": "Great Company!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Chemical Engineer in Kansas City, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people to work with,", "cons": "Very frequent changes in leadership."}], [{"review_title": "Great Company!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Chemical Engineer in Kansas City, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people to work with,", "cons": "Very frequent changes in leadership."}, {"review_title": "They are very by the book corporate", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Senior Data Architect in Aguadilla, PR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay\nNice team\nSome good growth potential", "cons": "Bad management\nCheap \nBy the book corporate and wont budge even in the slightest"}, {"review_title": "superb", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in New Delhi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "this company is superb and best", "cons": "there is no cons of this company"}, {"review_title": "Ruthless means to achieve the quarter", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Senior Engineer in Baton Rouge, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "World class in safety and manufacturing processes.

I arrive at the position and am ready to dive right in. \"Another team manages that\" or \"another team is responsible for that\" became frequent statements when asking questions. You have a question on a firewall? Go talk to this team. You have a question on how the network is configured? Go talk to that team. Any attempts to build a relationship, collaborate, request access (even view only) to learn the lay of the land and how things are configured ended up in black holes. Neither of those teams are forthcoming with information even though it was your assigned responsibility. I don't know whether it was the fear of job security or just internal politics, but it was nearly impossible to get anything done. If you had an idea or a suggestion, you had to have a meeting about it. Not only did you have to have a meeting about it, but you had to have a meeting to talk about needing to have a meeting for it. 8 hours in a 10 hour workday was spent in non-productive meetings, but they were mandatory and you couldn't get out of them. \n\nThe internal politics are the worst that I have ever seen. \n\nMy direct manager was great.

However, the running joke is \"it's the place where smart people go to feel bad about themselves.\" If you are willing to relocate, you can move up in the company.", "cons": "Too many to list, but here are the main cons:\n-Work/life balance: This is one of the biggest concerns across the company. We are a global organization so it's common to have early morning (6:00 am) and evening meetings (after 7:00 pm) and also working weekends and during \"vacations\". There is no consideration for personal commitments outside of work. You don't ever really get to take a vacation because you are still expected to check emails, attend meetings, etc.\n-Workloads: Due to significant layoffs across the company, most people are doing the job of 2 and 3 people. During the pandemic, there were times where the finance teams were pulling all nighters and working until midnight most days of the weeks. We had employees quitting after a couple months due to the workloads.\n-Diversity: Within the past year, they jumped on the diversity bandwagon but is disingenuous. I've observed them promote women or persons of color and shortly thereafter fire them and replace with a white male.\n-Compensation/Benefits: Benefits are subpar, 0% vesting on 401k until 3 years. In order to get health benefits you have to do a medical screening. Compensation is terrible. 2020 was a tough year for most companies but Honeywell was still meeting their financial commitments to the street yet not giving salary increases and little to no bonus. Also, to increase savings for the year, they would layoff employees a few weeks prior to bonus payouts and merit increases.\n-Culture: It's a punishment-based culture. The CEO sent an email to his leaders that ended-up making it's way throughout the org, basically encouraging his leaders to rule with an iron-fist, and by creating an environment of fear and more \"stick\" and less \"carrot\" will make you a more successful leader. They live for the month and quarter which means they will push and drive at all cost to meet their numbers to the street.

Multiple people left just to come back at a higher rate of pay because of this limit. \nThe inability to hire locally puts an added strain on managers and supervisors since it forces them to work 14 to 18 hour days to manage people in various time zones (My average day was 14 hours). Many managers have to take on the work of the employees they are trying to replace to meet deadlines, so this increases the stress. Very little Work-Life balance.\nThere are no bonuses for lower level management or general employees other than a Bravo, which are giving sparingly, and the compensation is low, even when the performance reviews are high, leading to a disgruntled workforce. \nChange to process without any consideration for the impact on work flow or adherence to standards needed to meet certain certifications causes extreme stress to the people who have to maintain those certifications, especially QA.\nThe strive for quality was overwhelmed by the need to meet numbers.

Took corporate FOREVER to finally allow work from home during the pandemic compared to other businesses of similar caliber and size. The official plan is to have employees come back to the office 3 days a week starting July 6th, 2021, and then full-time back in the office sometime in the fall, September/October time-frame. With no planned exemptions or flexibility involved. The WFH policy up until this point is essentially \"you can't\" unless you're legally required to be allowed to. They claim that working in the office is better for collaboration and teamwork and innovation, but as an employee both before and after being purchased by Honeywell, I can tell you there is almost NO collaboration or innovation going on, nor is it actually incentivized. They just like the buzzwords.\r\n\r\n- No Upward Mobility\r\n You would think a company like this would be incredibly interested in keeping the younger generation around and attracting young, new talent and retaining them to replace the \"old guard\" when they move on or retire, but they don't remotely care and it's obnoxiously evident. They drag out promotions for nearly a year or more, if you even get one at all. They get incredibly stingy with the raises when they actually do give them. They don't seem interested in giving you a career path, just expect you to be happy you're where you are and to stay there.\r\n\r\n- 401K Paid Out Once Per Year\r\n They only pay 401k match once a year in January, meaning you lose out on potential dividends. interest gains, and general gains over the course of the year that they could have been matching monthly. This also means if you leave at any point other than right after you receive your match, you miss out on potentially 11 months worth of 401k match funds.\r\n\r\n- Furloughs and Cut Cost-of-Living Raises are the Norm\r\n It's very typical to be furloughed, even as an engineer, for anywhere from 1 week to 1 full month every year. That's a lot of time that you can't really plan for to go without a paycheck, and there's no telling when they decide the financials need to look better, so everyone should take one for the team. They also frequently find excuses to not offer the yearly cost-of-living wage increases; Usually it's that the financial performance hasn't been great, despite having just shown slides that seemed an awful lot like the company was doing pretty good.\r\n\r\n- Inefficient, Silo'd Engineering & Lack of Training\r\n Almost all engineering teams work in silos all the time and team collaboration is just handled at the end when it has to be done, instead of integrating things throughout the course of development. There is also little to no training. If you ever do go through training, it's usually way to late to have ever been useful, but the training itself isn't usually actually helpful in the first place so it's really wouldn't matter.\r\n\r\n- Heavy Focus on Short-Term Stockholder Gains\r\n Most of the town-halls and other company-wide meetings usually cover financials from a high-level perspective talking about how great we are usually doing, and quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year financial improvements. As well as how great this would be for the stockholders. This wouldn't be such an issue if it weren't for the people that make the business profitable (the sales teams and the engineering teams) weren't treated as a disposable meat grinder. There is no conversation had about employee retention or what could be helpful to keep employees, giving the impression to back up the evidence, that they couldn't care less whether you stay or go.\r\n\r\n - Lots of Broken Promises\r\n They frequently like to have \"surveys\" that a mysteriously large portion of the company report never receiving and use these surveys to justify the state of things, while making \"promises\" and \"plans\" on how to \"improve\" things that NEVER actually come to fruition in any way more than an abstract \"we should be doing this\" conversation in a town-hall.\r\n\r\n- Hemorrhaging Employees\r\n Employee retention seems to be the last concern to upper-management. I've heard losses of engineering employees described as \"un-regrettable losses\".

You have a question on a firewall? Go talk to this team. You have a question on how the network is configured? Go talk to that team. Any attempts to build a relationship, collaborate, request access (even view only) to learn the lay of the land and how things are configured ended up in black holes. Neither of those teams are forthcoming with information even though it was your assigned responsibility. I don't know whether it was the fear of job security or just internal politics, but it was nearly impossible to get anything done. If you had an idea or a suggestion, you had to have a meeting about it. Not only did you have to have a meeting about it, but you had to have a meeting to talk about needing to have a meeting for it. 8 hours in a 10 hour workday was spent in non-productive meetings, but they were mandatory and you couldn't get out of them. \n\nThe internal politics are the worst that I have ever seen. \n\nMy direct manager was great. He was always willing and able to try to clear any roadblocks I had, but even he couldn't bulldoze through the existing political roadblocks or immaturity of some of the other team and their leads.\n\nI should have heeded HR's warning about the politics during onboarding more instead of just shrugging it off that every company has political issues."}, {"review_title": "They are so disorganized", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Machine Operator", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent pay,laid back, everyone pretty much sticks to themselves", "cons": "They don't have a clue what's going on in there own facility"}, {"review_title": "Overall", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Atomation Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Innovative, customer-based, Flexible, adaptable and futured", "cons": "challenging, challenging, challenging, challenging, challenging"}], [{"review_title": "Many smart people that are treated like widgets", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "World class processes\r\nVery smart people\r\nGlobal company with many career opportunities", "cons": "Only cares on bottom line\r\nDoesn\u2019t care about employees"}, {"review_title": "My Experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Senior Data Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Career Development, Professional Growth, Stability, Communication", "cons": "I would consider the high end competition between piers is the only cons."}, {"review_title": "Nice environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Senior Advanced project engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice culture and flexible work environment", "cons": "Lack of benefits\r\nNothings more to say"}, {"review_title": "RDE Finance Assistant manager", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "9 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company and culture and good place to work", "cons": "Nothing big as negative ..."}, {"review_title": "HON", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "15 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Senior Engineer in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Company to Work, Innovative Products", "cons": "Too much emphasis on Hierarchy and process ,"}, {"review_title": ".", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Career advancement opportunities\r\nMentoring programs\r\nTravel opportunities", "cons": "Work-life balance\r\nThey are not really interested if you are working 14 hours/day or not"}, {"review_title": "Went down hill", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "12 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Technical Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Used to be avery good place to work.

We are a global organization so it's common to have early morning (6:00 am) and evening meetings (after 7:00 pm) and also working weekends and during \"vacations\". There is no consideration for personal commitments outside of work. You don't ever really get to take a vacation because you are still expected to check emails, attend meetings, etc.\n-Workloads: Due to significant layoffs across the company, most people are doing the job of 2 and 3 people. During the pandemic, there were times where the finance teams were pulling all nighters and working until midnight most days of the weeks. We had employees quitting after a couple months due to the workloads.\n-Diversity: Within the past year, they jumped on the diversity bandwagon but is disingenuous. I've observed them promote women or persons of color and shortly thereafter fire them and replace with a white male.\n-Compensation/Benefits: Benefits are subpar, 0% vesting on 401k until 3 years. In order to get health benefits you have to do a medical screening. Compensation is terrible. 2020 was a tough year for most companies but Honeywell was still meeting their financial commitments to the street yet not giving salary increases and little to no bonus. Also, to increase savings for the year, they would layoff employees a few weeks prior to bonus payouts and merit increases.\n-Culture: It's a punishment-based culture. The CEO sent an email to his leaders that ended-up making it's way throughout the org, basically encouraging his leaders to rule with an iron-fist, and by creating an environment of fear and more \"stick\" and less \"carrot\" will make you a more successful leader. They live for the month and quarter which means they will push and drive at all cost to meet their numbers to the street.
