The reason corporations are now switching to this mentality is that extra cost is now hidden in the extra hours the employee will inevitably have to work to do both his job and the ancillary roles.

It is good to be part of a company that has the potential to impact/influence many areas across the globe.  \r\n\r\nMost employees are high-quality, great to collaborate with and, generally, are aligned to help deliver excellent products to customers.  \r\n\r\nHoneywell has a very good internal set of tools, resources and training to keep employees informed of what is going with the company, and many of the online resources are easy to navigate via self-service portals.  \r\n\r\nAs I the headline suggests, it is company that offers jobs, pays its employees* and provides benefits. It is most likely middle of the road in that regard - not standout but not subpar.  \r\n\r\nAccepting a job with Honeywell is a fine decision if you so choose - you could do worse  but you could also probably do better.  When I was hired I was told by a fellow colleague that \"Honeywell is a great company to come from...\", and I can see how that rings true at times.

Negotiate hard prior to accepting a job because the salary increases, bonuses and the like are few and far between.  \r\n\r\nAlso, depending on your region and business unit make sure you know the definition of furlough.  Here's a hint >> mandatory, unpaid time off.  I suppose it is better to lose one paycheck then to lose a job, but for the average employee that lost paycheck can mean a lot too.  \r\n\r\nMovement through the job bands?  Nearly impossible.  Regardless of your performance and the HR talk track about valuing employees etc... it rings hollow when time to increase pay or provide a bonus.  Times are always tough and justify why payouts and increases were not great (or nonexistent) at performance review time. \r\n\r\nAlso, I hope you like politics because they company is hierarchical and political. Probably the worst I have encountered in my two decades of professional life. It would be ideal if you could wade cleanly through the passive-aggressive behaviours that go on within Honeywell, but that is just not possible. There is always someone above you that you have to \"be careful of\" because they are connected to someone more important.  And to that end it appears that Honeywell has a level of leader that is immune to criticism or correction.  \r\n\r\nSimply put, it seems that Honeywell believes that it is a privilege to work for the company, and that its pedigree and history should compensate for the areas where it is lacking."}, {"review_title": "Solid Employer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "10 Mar 2020", "job_title": "PPC Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Consistently challenging work\r\nTeam environment in dept", "cons": "Working on better training\r\nWorking on better tools\r\nBetween department communication is poor\r\nStrict policies due to government contracts"}, {"review_title": "Honeywell is a good place to work and grow", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Sept 2008", "job_title": "Logistics Manager in Morristown, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Many avenues for personal growth, salary is decent, work life balance is good.

Perfect for people who value stability over a dynamic environment - i.e. a couple about to have kids paying off a mortgage. You don't get fired, or at least the chance is as low as public service. Six Sigma quality control and approach to software quality is good but outdated. Would recommend the place for the right type of person. They will pay for training like MCSE. They give you a decent powerful desktop and change almost every year and 2 huge monitors. People are genuinely nice and I liked my team and team Leader on a personal level. There is pride in quality of product. Weekly meetings to get everyone together and discuss issues. Extensive interview process makes you feel like you've really achieved something by getting the job. Transparency is god, everyone is honest. Generally its a 9-5 job though sometimes they try to ask you to work after 5 or weekends to which I would decline since pay was so low.", "cons": "Salary increases are barely higher than inflation. Automatic software/ system spits out a number based on your managers yes/no answers so your performance can be quantified into an overall performance index. Basically whatever number it spits out you just have to say no. My annual salary increase was $3500 when I was expecting $8000 at least. You then have to complain and say what you expect (this is what they tell you) making the whole automated system pointless unless you're a sheep and stay quiet. Movement between divisions almost impossible e.g. if you're in HVAC building control systems you're not going to transfer to aircraft control systems - thats like applying for a new job in a different company. Very little opportunity for work travel overseas and if it happens its to Minneapolis Minnesota in the case of the Sydney Branch for the absolute minimum amount of time - no time for sightseeing. Office set out more like cubicle public service than a modern cool IT company with spartan simple clean decor. Distance to work an issue unless you live on the North Shore of Sydney. AGILE is the new way of software development and Honeywell is still more waterfall model like. HVAC building control systems aren't that interesting (for me at least). You feel like a cog in the wheel sometimes. Sometimes tried to be encouraged to work overtime and on weekends with offer of free pizzas literally - how patronising (How about a decent salary and I'll happily put in the hard yards). As a dev you're completely separated and shielded from anything happening beyond tasks you have to do - makes you feel unimportant. People generally don't socialise outside work - they're very much your work colleagues not friends. Numerous meetings and disagreements made my project take six months and it didn't get done - they got an external contractor in who did it in 1 week and it was perfect, flawless and without bugs.

It is like a partnership to achieve our individual and group goals. For the partnership to work, it implies me to help and advice my peers and my manager whenever requested. I expect and I have received in return the same helping and advising from my peers and from my manager whenever I have asked them.\nFurthermore, there is a trust relationship meaning that my manager trusts me and is a strong supporter of me being proactive in solving issues.\n2.\tLearning materials\nLearning it is important as it ensures personal growth that contributes to the overall growth. At Honeywell, we are encouraged and we have access to many courses some mandatory and other optional. These courses are provided based on your professional development needs and your own requests.\n3.\tHoneywell culture and values\nOur culture and values that are based on behaviors, integrity, compliance, diversity, respect, performance awards, etc. safeguards that we have a propitious environment to focus on our tasks and, consequently, to shine in our jobs.\n4.\tDiversity\nAt Honeywell, diversity is not an empty word. I had the opportunity to work with wonderful people from around the world and I see diversity in all its forms, (age, gender, nationality, etc.) on a daily base.\nDiversity at Honeywell gives me hope and allows me to strongly push forward as I know what it means to be rejected at a job interview based on age.", "cons": "I have never heard about a result driven promotion program.

The benefits are ok, nothing really stands out except the HSA.

I was told as long as I get my work done well and in a professional manner that it did not matter whether I left at 3:00 PM or 9:00 PM. Most of the time I work nine hours or at most an hour over if I'm a bit busy but nothing too bad. My only problem is starting the day at 6:00 AM.\r\nCareer Experience - Where I am at (and most locations), I will get lots of experience that will allow me to grow as an engineer.

This is a review primarily of the ACST group, previously called SRDC and then CSTC.  It will probably be renamed and re-shuffled several more times in the next 5 years.  Regardless of the name, it is the group composed primarily of defense contractors in Golden Valley, MN.\r\n\r\nThe defense/gov contractors get priority here.  Anyone who wants to work on commercial products for regular consumers gets pushed aside.  This group is simply a group of panhandlers for corporate welfare from the government.\r\n\r\nManagement is incompetent.  There is almost no direction from the higher ups.  The only guiding motto is, paraphrasing: get more government money, and keep your work secret.  The group is so heavily compartmentalized that almost no one works together.  There is little sharing of knowledge and skills.  I heard that some new employees sit around doing nothing with no direction.  I don't feel that management encouraged or cared about my work.\r\n\r\nManagement (across Honeywell) is slow at making any decisions and cannot move on opportunities.  Bureaucracy is a problem.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, management, especially in ACST, is unethical and unprofessional.\r\n\r\nGossip is a problem in ACST.\r\n\r\nThe benefits at Honeywell are the worst of any company I\u2019ve seen.  The company\u2019s new vacation policy of \u201cwhatever number of days the employee feels like taking\u201d was an obvious theft of everyone\u2019s vacation time.  The health insurance is terrible with the highest deductibles and premiums of any company I\u2019ve seen.  The required health screenings are awkward.  Every year, management announces some new reduction in benefits.  This year, they stopped subsidizing dental insurance.\r\n\r\nDespite Honeywell being founded and based in America, the broader company seems to be giving American jobs to other countries as vigorously as possible.  Globalization is one of their primary goals.    The outsourcing of American work is just driven by greed.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Honeywell was at its peak circa 1960.  The company has very little in-house innovation today.  The products they\u2019re in, such as thermostats, jet engines, barcode readers, and gas burners, are old technology.  Honeywell just buys newer companies.  When I think of high tech companies, Honeywell does not come to mind.\r\n\r\nIn the broader Honeywell, I\u2019ve seen many layoffs, furloughs, and pay freezes."}, {"review_title": "Terrible", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Engineering Tech in Kansas City, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work schedule is easy and workload was simple.", "cons": "Insurance was terrible.

Good 401K and a marginal benefits package.", "cons": "The people who have been with Honeywell through all the changes have seen the company go from one of the most desirable places in Phoenix to work to a company that has no respect for their employees and no representation from the so called human resources office. With an aging workforce of retirement aged manpower of that which encompasses over 60% of the current workforce it will be interesting to see how they survive.\r\n\r\nWorking in one of the so-called elite departments of Honeywell it was badly managed. This department released 75% of their workforce with many technicians having 25 years or more walked out the door from a manager who had been with Honeywell less than a couple years. And had never turned a wrench or picked up a multimeter in his time of service with Honeywell.\r\n\r\nEmployees were taking the blame on projects not meeting deadlines because management failed to listen to the employee who the manager assigned to that project. Many times the employee was not involved in any form of an engineering review meeting for their inputs of the newly assigned project. They were never asked what they projected for a length of time and how many man hours would be needed to complete this project. Many times if you did voice yoru concerns this was seen as a bad attitude on the part of the technician, management was never wrong.\r\n\r\nManagers would hand out projects that would surpass hundreds of thousands of dollars to build, yet this was all done without any form of an engineering review process.  A project that exceeded a cost of $10,000.00 in most companies had at least 2 people reviewing this project to provide an estimation of time and cost to build and to review the whole scope of the project to review it for any problems. There was no set standard for doing any task, if you had to build a wire harness with 100 wires terminated on each end, some single wires and other triple shielded wires there was no standard used to provide a proper estimation of hours and cost to even strip a single wire and terminate it.\r\n\r\nWhen projects were in jeopardy of not meeting a deadline the employee paid the price. The manager called you into his office and expected a full explanation even if this project was first assigned to another technician and then passed onto you. If the first technician estimated the job wrong the second technician took the fall for this failure. Your manager would then tell you that you are now approved to work 70 hours a week. If you did not work the overtime and the project failed to meet the deadline this was reflected on your review as substandard performance. \r\n\r\nOne week we are working 70 hours and the next our hours cut to 36. Because of the location of where our shop was located on the campus the hourly charge for a technician from the shop was $140 per hour. It did not matter if the task was to replace a fuse or build a whole test cell the hourly charge was the same. There was no consideration from Honeywell for the technicians to save their jobs and move the shop to a cheaper piece of real estate. Again the technicians paid the price for this, even though it was no fault of theirs they were forced to send work to the Honeywell facility in Mexico and now Puerto Rico. Projects sent to Mexico often were sent back to Arizona with problems. Once again the technician had to troubleshoot this and repair it while management complained that the project was over-budget and the blame placed upon the technician. Over 700 machinist jobs and support personal were cut when Honeywell sent those jobs to Mexico and Czechoslovakia. Again no respect to an employee who has spent the better part of their working life for a company then shown the door. \r\n\r\nCarrer advancement was an excuse, there was none. If you did not call in sick during the year you got a $140 dollar bonus at the end of the year and a pizza party and a trophy to have. The math did not add up, at $25/hr for $1000.00 for 5 days and you get a bonus of $140.00. You could not take vacations at the beginning or end of the month. This was a problem with coworkers who had 4 or 5 weeks of vacation and you a new employee with 2 weeks and an under-staffed shop and then the days you could use it were mandated by management when you were allowed to take your earned vacation. And you had to find a coworker to accept your project too while you were away and then send out a email to all your customers, set up your outlook and voicemail even if this was for a single day...or your boss would call you into his office and have a closed door talk."}, {"review_title": "Tough Management crowd.

I\u2019m not going to tell you that you shouldn\u2019t, because I don\u2019t know you. But, you should do your due diligence and read the experiences of others and imagine yourself working here. You can start by taking a look at the negative reviews and compare them to the positive reviews--does it seem odd that the negative reviews tend to be very thorough and detailed, while the positive reviews are short, vapid platitudes? Filter the reviews by Software Engineer. Does it seem plausible to you that the positive reviews were artificially extracted out of interns and new hires who have no experience to accurately judge the environment or say anything of substance? You should consider if such an HR practice is objectionable to you on ethical grounds or not, and if you would feel comfortable being asked to do deceptive things like this habitually through your career.\r\n\r\nWhile on the topic of duplicitous behavior, it\u2019s important for you to consider the degree of confidence you have in any job description, or project description you may have received, and whether it would bother you to learn that the reality significantly deviates from your expectations. Would it bother you if three months from now, the project that you started working on were handed off to an offshore team on the other side of the planet, while you and your teammates are separated and distributed to other random projects? How would you feel about having to join late night meetings to train your offshore replacements, who have no familiarity with the technology or the architectural and design patterns you used? What if the \u201cflex-time\u201d you were promised manifests in reality as 12AM-3AM conference calls, and 16 hour workdays 7 days a week, for weeks, or months? Maybe this doesn\u2019t bother you, maybe you\u2019ve negotiated a salary sufficient to justify such risks--these are just considerations for you to evaluate.\r\n\r\nSalary, of course, is an important consideration. At first glance, it might seem like the salaries are in accord (or maybe even competitive) with the local market. However, it\u2019s important to compare apples to apples when you make your final decision, and you should come up with a fiscal value for various aspects of a work environment to quantify all factors and arrive at a final number.  Are you expecting to work 9-5, 40 hour weeks? Calculate your hourly rate--what would be the total salary if you were habitually required to work 60+ hour weeks? What if you had to spend weeks filling out forms and documents, and going through committee reviews and ticketing systems before you are allowed to use an industry-standard open-source technology on a project? Would that be a neutral, positive, or negative experience for you? What monetary value would you ascribe to such a work experience? What if you were forced to use 15-year old technology instead since it's already been approved? How do you feel about using deprecated versions of third party libraries from a decade ago in support of legacy software solutions? Would an extra $100/month be sufficient juice for the squeeze to stagnate professionally? How about an extra $200/month for adopting known industry anti-patterns and bad practices into the way that you create software? What would it take for you to stay motivated if you are told to build something that no customers want, but will be forced to buy through government contracts awarded via lobbying efforts? Think hard. Maybe a free mediocre lunch that takes 25 minutes of standing in line is fair recompense; maybe the idea of turning r/programminghorror into a karma mine for yourself puts a smile on your face? Each person is different. All I can tell you is that there\u2019s a high turnover rate as good people leave (unless they are trapped here by H1B visa sponsorship), and positions remain open for months (frequently they expire/are closed to save face without being filled).

You gain experience fast.", "cons": "Environment, culture, type of work - it's all awful. You are treated amazing during the recruitment process and provided with ambiguous descriptions for what you'll be doing- then once you accept- you start to see the ACTUAL nature of the day-to-day. I was lured in with the promise of a promotion and of course, just enough money to get my attention away from a terrific job I was happy at. The extra money IN NO WAY makes up for the TRULY AWFUL \"benefits\" you receive. Before I started I read the reviews here and thought it couldn't be THAT BAD - I assure you, it's worse. There isn't a choice of medical plans- it's the same exact AWFUL high deductible plan that is offered at two different providers, but the plan is the same. Basically, you pay a HUGE PREMIUM for coverage you aren't entitled to even use or access until you've met a GIANT HIGH DEDUCTIBLE. So for a family, this year, I will be $13,000 out of pocket before ANY benefits kick in - and even then it's 80% if its in network. It's almost useless insurance. None of my regular everyday prescriptions are covered by the insurance - so I pay 100% out of pocket cash for prescriptions each month. I am about $20,000 into health insurance for 2018 and I haven't seen any medical professionals at all under their plan. Now onto the environment. It's old, awful and feels like a prison or rat maze. If space, design or ambiance is important to you- this is nowhere near the company for you. The most comfortable place at my site is my car in the parking lot. Private offices are reserved for only the very highest levels of leadership so you are in an open bay. Everyone is on a headset all day talking so no matter what career level you are professionally, you'll be working in a terrible call center environment. And people have no shame - my \"neighbor\" clips his nails daily and lets it fly. ~cringe~ Sales people telecommute and work from home offices. Handfuls of people IN MY IMMEDIATE AREA telecommute. When I asked for a few days a month, I was told that it's not supported and people abuse it and those people are grandfathered. It's clear that *certain* people are afforded \"perks\" (it's a basic work/life family benefit these days) and promotions - and if you don't fit the mold, you're undesirable. Promotions are by who had been around the longest not on merit. There are no procedures or training materials in my area. It's a sink or swim mentality which means you show up, get a badge, they walk you around and people say hi and then you have to spend excruciating days trying to guess what to do, who to ask to ask about who you should ask, and what is expected of you. I am a mid to late career professional and have been at many workplaces across the country. I can say this has been the most awful because the reality differs so much from the promises during recruiting.  The pace is outrageous. There is no way you can keep up with the volume and pace of work given to you. If you do, guess what? You get even more so now you're expected to do even more on a schedule that was already impossible. The expectation for volume and results is unsustainable. This isn't a place where I could ever see how anyone builds a career without stressing out so bad you're sacrificing your health."}, {"review_title": "Executive Assistant", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "free coffee/soda  a handful of quality people", "cons": "NO Diversity and most of the discussion/presentation is around Gender only\r\nThe \"Good ole Boys Club\" is alive and well.

Regardless if you have a 100% high-performing group, approximately 10% (standard Bell curve) will be delivered a less than desirable performance review, whether or not deserved, resulting in a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) when placed in the lower right elbow of the 9 block. Then, approximately 3 to 4% of those people will be walked out the door after completed.  Every year, management comes together to discuss employee placement in the 9 block. The 9 block placement does not grade you as just an individual, but how you perform against the people in your group with the same title and across the entire organization.  \r\n\r\nOf the chosen pool, there are people who will not survive regardless of how well they perform to the PIP.  Senior Management unfortunately does not challenge their first-level managers even if they deserve to be challenged.  If the PIP becomes a formality because the first-level manager has already made up their mind, there is a minimal chance of surviving even if the expectations of the PIP are fulfilled. Several people have been targeted (not because they were lousy employees), and as a result, their lives were made miserable in the process.  There have been several people who were very well respected in the work community, but were still eliminated. In addition, there have been a couple managers who actually went to bat for their employees and lost because the quota to walk people out the door had not yet been fulfilled for the year. \r\n\r\nFor those of us who could have conquered the impossible, at the end of the day, it would not have altered the outcome. When there were well-deserved accolades, some of our managers would either never acknowledge them or slant them in negative light.  There were even times when comments were made which were quite frankly inaccurate and/or made up.  Next, is it acceptable to deliver a PIP with a 30 day requirement to a person the day they return to work from an approved short-term disability?  And when they request some time to regain their bearings after being out of the office for several months, they were denied accommodations. Then, to learn the PIP was actually finalized while the employee was on disability, in addition to it having an insurmountable intent.  After the PIP was completed, being told the expectations were fulfilled and then several months later being told they had failed.  After all this, having false accusations and mandates made by the first-level manager, and finally, when brought to HR's attention as being retaliatory, they were disregarded.  HR's existence at FM&T is not to assist in protecting the employees, but to side with the managers.  \r\n\r\nMorale is very low at FM&T due to the unfavorable treatment of their employees.  People are scared when it comes to performance review time because they question whether or not their turn has arrived to be considered a poor performer.

I've never encountered a develper that I actively dislike", "cons": "I want to start by saying that most of the positive reviews come from interns and not real employees with experience. So the number of stars is highly inflated. There are also several other major issues here:\r\n\r\nThere are multiple cases of people getting promoted for doing nothing. In addition, they've gotten promoted without offering these positions out to other people. This is unfair and demotivating to those of us that work hard.\r\n\r\nPromotions are given out not based on delivery; but based on how much you drive a project or your team. This produces an environment where the more competent managers are not rewarded for their technical acumen and wisdom. \r\n\r\nYour development skills will somewhat stagnate and possibly decline here. Many of us spend time producing nice documents because it looks good for the executives instead of actually developing Software. \r\n\r\nThe executives expect the software developers to do everything. You want customer feedback: YOU go talk to the customer (this is the job of marketing and customer relations). You want to know what the business value of the project is? YOU go calculate it. There are different departments in the company for a reason. We can't do everything!\r\n\r\nThis is one of the only places where the upper level management doesn't listen to the software engineers. If you tell them something is not feasible, they will still go ahead and attempt to build it because they have already made the decision without considering the viability of the project.\r\n\r\nThe project requirements and use cases change mid project (assuming they were even defined in the first place). It's a struggle to determine why you were even working on a project and what the business value is. This causes a chaotic process where at the end of the project, all the departments blame each other because there is no deliverable.\r\n\r\nWhile we're bringing up business value: We hardly ever have customers for the products that we build. We build something because somebody in the company thinks it's a good idea without getting customer validation.\r\n\r\nThere is no sane process for selecting metrics to hit for projects. Why does the UI have to respond is 100 milliseconds? Why does the latency of this API have to be 50 milliseconds when the user will only be querying it every 15 minutes? This is all driven by someone just blurting something out in a meeting as opposed to actually analyzing something.\r\n\r\nWorking with other departments is toxic. It's always a constant battle to get the resources that you need because everyone thinks that they are going to be stabbed in the back. The collaboration with other parts of the company is always a political struggle.\r\n\r\nThe executives don't seem to understand that there are legitimate blockers to software projects. When the platform that you have to integrate with is broken, this is a blocker. Telling me to \"get it done\" doesn't help anyone. You can't just drive people and yell at them for not getting stuff done when there are legitimate high level blockers to your work.\r\n\r\nHoneywell is a marketing driven company. It seems like EVERYTHING here is done for pure marketing purposes even if the final product isn't that good. Rational functional requirements don't really exist here. As long as it looks good for the cameras, they'll execute it!\r\n\r\nThey want to make it seem like this is the Google of Atlanta. IT'S NOT! \r\n\r\nThe idea that this company operates like a startup is wrong. There is too much bloat in the process for this company to ever function like a startup. The only way some projects are similar to a startup are the hours that you put in because you have to constantly rebuild stuff because the requirements are a moving target. This regularly produces death marches.\r\n\r\nEverything is driven from the top down. So when you have people that don't really understand software trying to tell people that do how to build software, this causes an immense amount of disconnect, discord, and completely unrealistic expectations.\r\n\r\nThis is compounded by the fact that non-technical people lead projects. This is chaotic because the non-technical people don't understand that we cannot deliver a product without explicit requirements and that what is usually asked is not even remotely close to being viable. Assuming it is viable, the timelines are usually completely unrealistic.\r\n\r\nIt takes forever to get the simplest of tasks done here. What may take a developer a week to achieve takes 2 months because there is so much red tape around everything. It's like the company actively attempts to not release software that they're been working on.\r\n\r\nBecause all of these issues, there is a major attrition and retention problem. Developers are always leaving the company. It's actually sad because I wanted to like Honeywell. I think there was a lot of potential for this company to create some really cool products. We also have some fairly strong developers (many of them leave and go to high profile tech companies). But that get's lost in bloat, politics, and indecision that plagues the executive level. Until the executives stop driving everything, the situation won't improve. Please save yourself some time and don't come here. You'll be sorry that you did."}], [{"review_title": "It's a nice place", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Nov 2010", "job_title": " in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good people, good benefits, stable company, lots of opportunity in the Phoenix area to move around and try different jobs.", "cons": "Lower level jobs being sent overseas very rapidly.

They do not allow you to work from home or take vacation. Work/Life balance does not exist.  They have moved to an \"unlimited\" vacation program, but this is not because they want salary/exempt employees (non-exempt employees are not eligible for the program) to actually have unlimited vacation.  It\u2019s because their turnover is so high and they cannot retain people, they needed a way to reduce cost and not payout vacation to employees who quit. Their culture is disgusting.

Quick decisions are stifled by matrix-ed corporate hierarchy.\r\n Benefits -  especially health care are not competitive with top employers.  During the interview process - you have to dig deep to find out what the benefits include.  The offer letter will simply state that they offer a benefit package that includes health, dental , etc. with no details on the cost or options.  As a former manager who hired several people - I always encouraged prospective new hires to push HR for answers on this - so they would not be surprised or disappointed should they accept a position.  \r\nHW has an attitude that suppliers want to work with them because they are so big.   The reality is often different.  Long time local suppliers who have a history of supporting a business are often thrown out in favor of national, or global contracts - where the new supplier has no relationship or familiarity with the newly acquired business.  This can lead to delivery problems and quality issues.\r\nTravel is virtually non-existent unless you are in a \"customer facing\" role.   So - forget that technical seminar or trade show unless you're a salesman.   Career opportunities for non-sales or marketing people is also very limited.   \r\nFocus and tooting the horn of top management (Mr. Cote) is relentless.  Each day when you log onto the internal web site - you are informed of some new wonderful thing he has done.

If you make it, the Project & Program people (Band 4) all get fat bonuses and you will be lucky to get 1.5% raise at the end of the year.  You exist as a Band 3 employee to make everyone else successful.  My first year here, after agreeing on a salary, I came in and they took 10% of everyone's pay that year.  They also did not purchase office supplies, cut back 401K, cut back on insurance, etc.  The next year, the raises averaged 2.5%, the 3rd year it averaged 2%, the next 2 years everyone's raises were 0% (except for Band 4 employees, they all had 0% raises, but received huge bonuses), and this year the average raise was 1.5%.  People are leaving all of the time because you can easily make between 33% to 50% more salary at another company doing the same work.  Raises are determined in a \"totem-pole\" meeting that only Band 4 people are invited to.  They sit around and discuss every single employee in the department and assign you to a place on the totem-pole.  Of course, the Band 4 employees are always at the top, because they make the decision.  Then, there is a pot of money of a certain size, and then they go down from top to bottom deciding raise amounts.  When you make $120k per year (for example) 6% to 8% raises (and even upwards of 10% at times) eats up a lot of that money quickly.  After all of the Band 4 people get their raises, there is not very much money left, so the Band 3 employees get the scraps, based on totem-pole ranking.  Everyone will tell you that if you want to make money, you have to leave the company and either stay away, or then come back later to get hired in at a higher salary.  Sticking it out will keep you near your starting salary.  In the 6 years I have been here, the three small raises I have received (summed together) has not even made up the 10% they took from that first year."}, {"review_title": "This company allows you to excel in your position by giving a lot of training online and in a classroom setting", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Oct 2014", "job_title": "Senior Product Technology Specialist in Des Plaines, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people are nice & excellent at their jobs, and they are willing to mentor you.", "cons": "I would have to say that my #1 con was that I was not mentored or trained at all by my manager.

It is like a partnership to achieve our individual and group goals. For the partnership to work, it implies me to help and advice my peers and my manager whenever requested. I expect and I have received in return the same helping and advising from my peers and from my manager whenever I have asked them.\nFurthermore, there is a trust relationship meaning that my manager trusts me and is a strong supporter of me being proactive in solving issues.\n2.\tLearning materials\nLearning it is important as it ensures personal growth that contributes to the overall growth. At Honeywell, we are encouraged and we have access to many courses some mandatory and other optional. These courses are provided based on your professional development needs and your own requests.\n3.\tHoneywell culture and values\nOur culture and values that are based on behaviors, integrity, compliance, diversity, respect, performance awards, etc. safeguards that we have a propitious environment to focus on our tasks and, consequently, to shine in our jobs.\n4.\tDiversity\nAt Honeywell, diversity is not an empty word. I had the opportunity to work with wonderful people from around the world and I see diversity in all its forms, (age, gender, nationality, etc.) on a daily base.\nDiversity at Honeywell gives me hope and allows me to strongly push forward as I know what it means to be rejected at a job interview based on age.", "cons": "I have never heard about a result driven promotion program.

Across Honeywell, I saw many who had mastered the art of looking busy while contributing almost nothing (aka, fake work).  This is a place for someone who wants to fill their schedule with travel of dubious value or purpose.", "cons": "Overall, a truly awful place to work.  This is a review primarily of the ACST group, previously called SRDC and then CSTC.  It will probably be renamed and re-shuffled several more times in the next 5 years.  Regardless of the name, it is the group composed primarily of defense contractors in Golden Valley, MN.\r\n\r\nThe defense/gov contractors get priority here.  Anyone who wants to work on commercial products for regular consumers gets pushed aside.  This group is simply a group of panhandlers for corporate welfare from the government.\r\n\r\nManagement is incompetent.  There is almost no direction from the higher ups.  The only guiding motto is, paraphrasing: get more government money, and keep your work secret.  The group is so heavily compartmentalized that almost no one works together.  There is little sharing of knowledge and skills.  I heard that some new employees sit around doing nothing with no direction.  I don't feel that management encouraged or cared about my work.\r\n\r\nManagement (across Honeywell) is slow at making any decisions and cannot move on opportunities.  Bureaucracy is a problem.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, management, especially in ACST, is unethical and unprofessional.\r\n\r\nGossip is a problem in ACST.\r\n\r\nThe benefits at Honeywell are the worst of any company I\u2019ve seen.  The company\u2019s new vacation policy of \u201cwhatever number of days the employee feels like taking\u201d was an obvious theft of everyone\u2019s vacation time.  The health insurance is terrible with the highest deductibles and premiums of any company I\u2019ve seen.  The required health screenings are awkward.  Every year, management announces some new reduction in benefits.  This year, they stopped subsidizing dental insurance.\r\n\r\nDespite Honeywell being founded and based in America, the broader company seems to be giving American jobs to other countries as vigorously as possible.  Globalization is one of their primary goals.    The outsourcing of American work is just driven by greed.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Honeywell was at its peak circa 1960.  The company has very little in-house innovation today.  The products they\u2019re in, such as thermostats, jet engines, barcode readers, and gas burners, are old technology.  Honeywell just buys newer companies.  When I think of high tech companies, Honeywell does not come to mind.\r\n\r\nIn the broader Honeywell, I\u2019ve seen many layoffs, furloughs, and pay freezes."}, {"review_title": "Terrible", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Engineering Tech in Kansas City, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work schedule is easy and workload was simple.", "cons": "Insurance was terrible.

Good 401K and a marginal benefits package.", "cons": "The people who have been with Honeywell through all the changes have seen the company go from one of the most desirable places in Phoenix to work to a company that has no respect for their employees and no representation from the so called human resources office. With an aging workforce of retirement aged manpower of that which encompasses over 60% of the current workforce it will be interesting to see how they survive.\r\n\r\nWorking in one of the so-called elite departments of Honeywell it was badly managed. This department released 75% of their workforce with many technicians having 25 years or more walked out the door from a manager who had been with Honeywell less than a couple years. And had never turned a wrench or picked up a multimeter in his time of service with Honeywell.\r\n\r\nEmployees were taking the blame on projects not meeting deadlines because management failed to listen to the employee who the manager assigned to that project. Many times the employee was not involved in any form of an engineering review meeting for their inputs of the newly assigned project. They were never asked what they projected for a length of time and how many man hours would be needed to complete this project. Many times if you did voice yoru concerns this was seen as a bad attitude on the part of the technician, management was never wrong.\r\n\r\nManagers would hand out projects that would surpass hundreds of thousands of dollars to build, yet this was all done without any form of an engineering review process.  A project that exceeded a cost of $10,000.00 in most companies had at least 2 people reviewing this project to provide an estimation of time and cost to build and to review the whole scope of the project to review it for any problems. There was no set standard for doing any task, if you had to build a wire harness with 100 wires terminated on each end, some single wires and other triple shielded wires there was no standard used to provide a proper estimation of hours and cost to even strip a single wire and terminate it.\r\n\r\nWhen projects were in jeopardy of not meeting a deadline the employee paid the price. The manager called you into his office and expected a full explanation even if this project was first assigned to another technician and then passed onto you. If the first technician estimated the job wrong the second technician took the fall for this failure. Your manager would then tell you that you are now approved to work 70 hours a week. If you did not work the overtime and the project failed to meet the deadline this was reflected on your review as substandard performance. \r\n\r\nOne week we are working 70 hours and the next our hours cut to 36. Because of the location of where our shop was located on the campus the hourly charge for a technician from the shop was $140 per hour. It did not matter if the task was to replace a fuse or build a whole test cell the hourly charge was the same. There was no consideration from Honeywell for the technicians to save their jobs and move the shop to a cheaper piece of real estate. Again the technicians paid the price for this, even though it was no fault of theirs they were forced to send work to the Honeywell facility in Mexico and now Puerto Rico. Projects sent to Mexico often were sent back to Arizona with problems. Once again the technician had to troubleshoot this and repair it while management complained that the project was over-budget and the blame placed upon the technician. Over 700 machinist jobs and support personal were cut when Honeywell sent those jobs to Mexico and Czechoslovakia. Again no respect to an employee who has spent the better part of their working life for a company then shown the door. \r\n\r\nCarrer advancement was an excuse, there was none. If you did not call in sick during the year you got a $140 dollar bonus at the end of the year and a pizza party and a trophy to have. The math did not add up, at $25/hr for $1000.00 for 5 days and you get a bonus of $140.00. You could not take vacations at the beginning or end of the month. This was a problem with coworkers who had 4 or 5 weeks of vacation and you a new employee with 2 weeks and an under-staffed shop and then the days you could use it were mandated by management when you were allowed to take your earned vacation. And you had to find a coworker to accept your project too while you were away and then send out a email to all your customers, set up your outlook and voicemail even if this was for a single day...or your boss would call you into his office and have a closed door talk."}], [{"review_title": "Tough Management crowd.

I\u2019m not going to tell you that you shouldn\u2019t, because I don\u2019t know you. But, you should do your due diligence and read the experiences of others and imagine yourself working here. You can start by taking a look at the negative reviews and compare them to the positive reviews--does it seem odd that the negative reviews tend to be very thorough and detailed, while the positive reviews are short, vapid platitudes? Filter the reviews by Software Engineer. Does it seem plausible to you that the positive reviews were artificially extracted out of interns and new hires who have no experience to accurately judge the environment or say anything of substance? You should consider if such an HR practice is objectionable to you on ethical grounds or not, and if you would feel comfortable being asked to do deceptive things like this habitually through your career.\r\n\r\nWhile on the topic of duplicitous behavior, it\u2019s important for you to consider the degree of confidence you have in any job description, or project description you may have received, and whether it would bother you to learn that the reality significantly deviates from your expectations. Would it bother you if three months from now, the project that you started working on were handed off to an offshore team on the other side of the planet, while you and your teammates are separated and distributed to other random projects? How would you feel about having to join late night meetings to train your offshore replacements, who have no familiarity with the technology or the architectural and design patterns you used? What if the \u201cflex-time\u201d you were promised manifests in reality as 12AM-3AM conference calls, and 16 hour workdays 7 days a week, for weeks, or months? Maybe this doesn\u2019t bother you, maybe you\u2019ve negotiated a salary sufficient to justify such risks--these are just considerations for you to evaluate.\r\n\r\nSalary, of course, is an important consideration. At first glance, it might seem like the salaries are in accord (or maybe even competitive) with the local market. However, it\u2019s important to compare apples to apples when you make your final decision, and you should come up with a fiscal value for various aspects of a work environment to quantify all factors and arrive at a final number.  Are you expecting to work 9-5, 40 hour weeks? Calculate your hourly rate--what would be the total salary if you were habitually required to work 60+ hour weeks? What if you had to spend weeks filling out forms and documents, and going through committee reviews and ticketing systems before you are allowed to use an industry-standard open-source technology on a project? Would that be a neutral, positive, or negative experience for you? What monetary value would you ascribe to such a work experience? What if you were forced to use 15-year old technology instead since it's already been approved? How do you feel about using deprecated versions of third party libraries from a decade ago in support of legacy software solutions? Would an extra $100/month be sufficient juice for the squeeze to stagnate professionally? How about an extra $200/month for adopting known industry anti-patterns and bad practices into the way that you create software? What would it take for you to stay motivated if you are told to build something that no customers want, but will be forced to buy through government contracts awarded via lobbying efforts? Think hard. Maybe a free mediocre lunch that takes 25 minutes of standing in line is fair recompense; maybe the idea of turning r/programminghorror into a karma mine for yourself puts a smile on your face? Each person is different. All I can tell you is that there\u2019s a high turnover rate as good people leave (unless they are trapped here by H1B visa sponsorship), and positions remain open for months (frequently they expire/are closed to save face without being filled).

You are treated amazing during the recruitment process and provided with ambiguous descriptions for what you'll be doing- then once you accept- you start to see the ACTUAL nature of the day-to-day. I was lured in with the promise of a promotion and of course, just enough money to get my attention away from a terrific job I was happy at. The extra money IN NO WAY makes up for the TRULY AWFUL \"benefits\" you receive. Before I started I read the reviews here and thought it couldn't be THAT BAD - I assure you, it's worse. There isn't a choice of medical plans- it's the same exact AWFUL high deductible plan that is offered at two different providers, but the plan is the same. Basically, you pay a HUGE PREMIUM for coverage you aren't entitled to even use or access until you've met a GIANT HIGH DEDUCTIBLE. So for a family, this year, I will be $13,000 out of pocket before ANY benefits kick in - and even then it's 80% if its in network. It's almost useless insurance. None of my regular everyday prescriptions are covered by the insurance - so I pay 100% out of pocket cash for prescriptions each month. I am about $20,000 into health insurance for 2018 and I haven't seen any medical professionals at all under their plan. Now onto the environment. It's old, awful and feels like a prison or rat maze. If space, design or ambiance is important to you- this is nowhere near the company for you. The most comfortable place at my site is my car in the parking lot. Private offices are reserved for only the very highest levels of leadership so you are in an open bay. Everyone is on a headset all day talking so no matter what career level you are professionally, you'll be working in a terrible call center environment. And people have no shame - my \"neighbor\" clips his nails daily and lets it fly. ~cringe~ Sales people telecommute and work from home offices. Handfuls of people IN MY IMMEDIATE AREA telecommute. When I asked for a few days a month, I was told that it's not supported and people abuse it and those people are grandfathered. It's clear that *certain* people are afforded \"perks\" (it's a basic work/life family benefit these days) and promotions - and if you don't fit the mold, you're undesirable. Promotions are by who had been around the longest not on merit. There are no procedures or training materials in my area. It's a sink or swim mentality which means you show up, get a badge, they walk you around and people say hi and then you have to spend excruciating days trying to guess what to do, who to ask to ask about who you should ask, and what is expected of you. I am a mid to late career professional and have been at many workplaces across the country. I can say this has been the most awful because the reality differs so much from the promises during recruiting.  The pace is outrageous. There is no way you can keep up with the volume and pace of work given to you. If you do, guess what? You get even more so now you're expected to do even more on a schedule that was already impossible. The expectation for volume and results is unsustainable.

Regardless if you have a 100% high-performing group, approximately 10% (standard Bell curve) will be delivered a less than desirable performance review, whether or not deserved, resulting in a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) when placed in the lower right elbow of the 9 block. Then, approximately 3 to 4% of those people will be walked out the door after completed.  Every year, management comes together to discuss employee placement in the 9 block. The 9 block placement does not grade you as just an individual, but how you perform against the people in your group with the same title and across the entire organization.  \r\n\r\nOf the chosen pool, there are people who will not survive regardless of how well they perform to the PIP.  Senior Management unfortunately does not challenge their first-level managers even if they deserve to be challenged.  If the PIP becomes a formality because the first-level manager has already made up their mind, there is a minimal chance of surviving even if the expectations of the PIP are fulfilled. Several people have been targeted (not because they were lousy employees), and as a result, their lives were made miserable in the process.  There have been several people who were very well respected in the work community, but were still eliminated. In addition, there have been a couple managers who actually went to bat for their employees and lost because the quota to walk people out the door had not yet been fulfilled for the year. \r\n\r\nFor those of us who could have conquered the impossible, at the end of the day, it would not have altered the outcome. When there were well-deserved accolades, some of our managers would either never acknowledge them or slant them in negative light.  There were even times when comments were made which were quite frankly inaccurate and/or made up.  Next, is it acceptable to deliver a PIP with a 30 day requirement to a person the day they return to work from an approved short-term disability?  And when they request some time to regain their bearings after being out of the office for several months, they were denied accommodations. Then, to learn the PIP was actually finalized while the employee was on disability, in addition to it having an insurmountable intent.  After the PIP was completed, being told the expectations were fulfilled and then several months later being told they had failed.  After all this, having false accusations and mandates made by the first-level manager, and finally, when brought to HR's attention as being retaliatory, they were disregarded.  HR's existence at FM&T is not to assist in protecting the employees, but to side with the managers.  \r\n\r\nMorale is very low at FM&T due to the unfavorable treatment of their employees.  People are scared when it comes to performance review time because they question whether or not their turn has arrived to be considered a poor performer.

The company is obsessed with minimizing all line-item costs at the expense of difficult to measure costs (cost of unhappy employees).  We have perks, but the perks seem to be there simply to that HR can check a box to say that they are there.  For example, my facility has a ping-pong table so that we can claim to have a game room.  One ping-pong table for over a thousand employees.  We have a fitness room, but you need to sign a waver, and wait 3 weeks for that paperwork to be processed before you can begin using it which discourages people from bothering.  We have very competitive base pay, but literally no financial perks like an employee stock purchase plan or company-paid HSA contributions like other companies have.  We have a cafeteria on site with decent food, but the prices are so high that you'd be silly not to walk across the street.  We have unlimited time off, but it's actually at the discretion of your manager, who is under immense pressure to cut costs and deliver projects under an already unrealistically low budget, so good luck getting more than 2 weeks, and expect to be made to feel like you're making things difficult whenever you take a day off.  We're a huge company, so you can move around if you're unhappy in a position, except, there is a policy and politics in place that force you to stay in a particular job, so in reality, you are forced to quit if you want to make things better.  To make matters worse, if you leave before the 3 year mark, the company will take back the 401k matching benefit.  I keep working here because I want to hit the 3 year mark to get the match as well as have some solid evidence of experience for my resume.  It sucks because I love my coworkers and I find the work I do to be very interesting.  It's just that every time I start to get excited about my job, a manager will do something to remind me that there will be no reward for my hard work.", "cons": "Apart from the pros actually being cons, due to the obsession on costs, we try to avoid giving raises and promotions until people threaten to leave.

I've never encountered a develper that I actively dislike", "cons": "I want to start by saying that most of the positive reviews come from interns and not real employees with experience. So the number of stars is highly inflated. There are also several other major issues here:\r\n\r\nThere are multiple cases of people getting promoted for doing nothing. In addition, they've gotten promoted without offering these positions out to other people. This is unfair and demotivating to those of us that work hard.\r\n\r\nPromotions are given out not based on delivery; but based on how much you drive a project or your team. This produces an environment where the more competent managers are not rewarded for their technical acumen and wisdom. \r\n\r\nYour development skills will somewhat stagnate and possibly decline here. Many of us spend time producing nice documents because it looks good for the executives instead of actually developing Software. \r\n\r\nThe executives expect the software developers to do everything. You want customer feedback: YOU go talk to the customer (this is the job of marketing and customer relations). You want to know what the business value of the project is? YOU go calculate it. There are different departments in the company for a reason. We can't do everything!\r\n\r\nThis is one of the only places where the upper level management doesn't listen to the software engineers. If you tell them something is not feasible, they will still go ahead and attempt to build it because they have already made the decision without considering the viability of the project.\r\n\r\nThe project requirements and use cases change mid project (assuming they were even defined in the first place). It's a struggle to determine why you were even working on a project and what the business value is. This causes a chaotic process where at the end of the project, all the departments blame each other because there is no deliverable.\r\n\r\nWhile we're bringing up business value: We hardly ever have customers for the products that we build. We build something because somebody in the company thinks it's a good idea without getting customer validation.\r\n\r\nThere is no sane process for selecting metrics to hit for projects. Why does the UI have to respond is 100 milliseconds? Why does the latency of this API have to be 50 milliseconds when the user will only be querying it every 15 minutes? This is all driven by someone just blurting something out in a meeting as opposed to actually analyzing something.\r\n\r\nWorking with other departments is toxic. It's always a constant battle to get the resources that you need because everyone thinks that they are going to be stabbed in the back. The collaboration with other parts of the company is always a political struggle.\r\n\r\nThe executives don't seem to understand that there are legitimate blockers to software projects. When the platform that you have to integrate with is broken, this is a blocker. Telling me to \"get it done\" doesn't help anyone. You can't just drive people and yell at them for not getting stuff done when there are legitimate high level blockers to your work.\r\n\r\nHoneywell is a marketing driven company. It seems like EVERYTHING here is done for pure marketing purposes even if the final product isn't that good. Rational functional requirements don't really exist here. As long as it looks good for the cameras, they'll execute it!\r\n\r\nThey want to make it seem like this is the Google of Atlanta. IT'S NOT! \r\n\r\nThe idea that this company operates like a startup is wrong. There is too much bloat in the process for this company to ever function like a startup. The only way some projects are similar to a startup are the hours that you put in because you have to constantly rebuild stuff because the requirements are a moving target. This regularly produces death marches.\r\n\r\nEverything is driven from the top down. So when you have people that don't really understand software trying to tell people that do how to build software, this causes an immense amount of disconnect, discord, and completely unrealistic expectations.\r\n\r\nThis is compounded by the fact that non-technical people lead projects. This is chaotic because the non-technical people don't understand that we cannot deliver a product without explicit requirements and that what is usually asked is not even remotely close to being viable. Assuming it is viable, the timelines are usually completely unrealistic.\r\n\r\nIt takes forever to get the simplest of tasks done here. What may take a developer a week to achieve takes 2 months because there is so much red tape around everything. It's like the company actively attempts to not release software that they're been working on.\r\n\r\nBecause all of these issues, there is a major attrition and retention problem. Developers are always leaving the company. It's actually sad because I wanted to like Honeywell. I think there was a lot of potential for this company to create some really cool products. We also have some fairly strong developers (many of them leave and go to high profile tech companies). But that get's lost in bloat, politics, and indecision that plagues the executive level. Until the executives stop driving everything, the situation won't improve. Please save yourself some time and don't come here.

The division was profitable and growing, yet not enough to meet the arbitrary standards of leadership. Stock prices went up and the dividend % increased, but employees were called to sacrifice their pay. This might have been more palatable if the leaders had given up their bonuses as well in a sign of solidarity - but of course they did not and likely received larger bonuses because of the furlough. The cherry on top came in early 2018 when one of the SPS VPs was given an expensive sports car as a \"reward\" for his part of the company doing so well - how out of touch are you that you think that would be received well by the employees who just lost 5% of their 2017 salary due to \"inadequate performance\"? Either A) leadership is really that out of touch or B) they know exactly what they're doing and don't care, because they'll likely get promoted or find a new opportunity elsewhere soon, leaving someone else holding the bag."}, {"review_title": "Not recommended-run away, you will not be happy here. no respect to people", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Dec 2018", "job_title": "Senior Executive in Golden Valley, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Big name, decent base pay but be careful with no raise, furlough, super high health care cost, etc.", "cons": "No culture; low morale, no respect to people, just top down,people who k-ass can survive; no investment into new products and people; Constant wipe out higher ranking folks then new people come in and turn around asking why the business is not growing and fire people below; Super high cost healthcare; bad 401k policy(3yr vest, year end match);  no one is happy there, move jobs to Atlanta;"}, {"review_title": "Project Manager", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "15 Dec 2018", "job_title": "Project Manager in Morris Plains, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Its legacy, its brand and reputation that people inside have built over decades with best in class avionic product line.

Further, Honeywell does not grow organically;  it grows by raising prices and cutting wages.  As an employee, you quickly learn which side of that equation you're on.  Pay raises are meagre (mine was <1% in 2019),  benefits were very expensive compared to any other I've ever had, and our division--the business unit of the year in 2018--was punished with a 2-week unpaid furlough in 2019, as it was just a few years earlier.   Honeywell generally operates on a zero goodwill, letter-of-the-law business practice, so employees should be very well versed on all clauses of their employment contract, as Honeywell is unafraid to exercise parachute clauses that would be rarely used otherwise.  From what I saw at Honeywell, fairness is irrelevant, contractual obligations are the only thing that matters.  I've never seen a company so unafraid to flush its customers down the toilet.\r\n\r\nHoneywell's culture is defined by employees who compete with each other to play the role of Captain No, and management who go around yelling at people to just do some work.  Basic decisions are constantly stalled in \"SEA approval,\"  meaning management is continually operating as petty financial approvers rather than executing to a grand vision.   Management runs its businesses off a spreadsheet, generally with little-to-no understanding of the customers or markets it serves.\r\n\r\nWith a corporate culture where 'no' as the de-facto answer and talent management is nowhere to be seen,  most people who had any semblance of ambition lost their mind and went elsewhere (and I did), often in less than a year at Honeywell.  Turnover in sales was particularly bad, as many people quickly realized that it's easier to win a prize at a rigged carnival game than it is to earn full sales commission at Honeywell.  A customer of a fellow colleague told him (who was the umpteenth Honeywell rep they had had): \"you won't even last a year there!\" and the customer's premonition was ultimately right.   While Honeywell's offer looked close to my previous employer's total compensation on paper, as the year wore on, had I not quit, my 2019 pay would have been nearly $45,000 lower than what I earned at my previous employer.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I learned the hard way that you can`t fix stupid.  Honeywell's workforce is rife with morons, nincompoops, and dumb-dumbs, which fosters a willpower and spirit depleting environment where it's just easier to be complicit in letting bad decisions pass along rather than push 20 boulders back up the mountain to fight it.  The only people who do stick around are bottom 10%'ers who enjoy the comfort of swimming in a sea of incompetence and are generally unemployable elsewhere."}]]
