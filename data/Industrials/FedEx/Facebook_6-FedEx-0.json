During orientation they tell you the goal is 100 packages loaded an hour, this was a great pace not dangerous or hard if you're active and in shape leaving you time to load, organize, and stage your trucks. Now (about 6 or 7 months in) the pace is commonly 150-200 packages an hour, this is to cut labor hours I guess, to make the pace somewhat possible management and people from unload will come to help clean up your areas. Problem is (besides the inhumane treatment of employees) they need to help clean up because that pace causes you to constantly \"Stack out\" basically scan/drop your package to load when you can and keep doing that because you're taking 5 - 15 packages off the belt at the same time. When you're doing this all day you're more likely to damage packages, you're more likely to have tripping hazards, when you get large items it's very hard to make space for them, you will have a much harder time providing a quality load for your truck drivers. Heavy Items Hours (time and amount) Early odd hours to get the longer shifts, longer shifts are commonly less then 5hrs even for the best loaders who are kept on the longest. PTO is based off the hours posted on the schedule 3hrs perday (after 90days employed) Everything else with almost every low level labor jobs in the US."

FedEx is still Not leaving me alone (FedEx fired me in January 2022 for my excellent work there), - like - in this moment FedEx is hindering me to put my review here, - FedEx does not want anybody to know their Real Organized Criminal Gang FedEx face. FedEx hacked all of my personal electronics, including my Toyota, and, was deleting my personal files with my evidences against FedEx. Some files were completely ruined - I could see only the names of the files and nothing else. Some of my folders were emptied. My recorded calls with FedEx were deleted from my smart phone or edited - the recorded phrases were replaced with others (by the same voices). My voice mail messages on my phone were listened by FedEx on the purpose - before I knew about them. My adobe software on my laptop was constantly \u201cedited\u201d that I could not use it. Audio on my laptop is ruined. My accounts were blocked very often and my passwords were constantly changed. When I was going to a public computer in a library - it was the same, my accounts were blocked. I could not operate my Toyota Highlander with satellite connection - as I wanted, - they were stopping my navigation to work during my trip out of town and accelerating my Toyota to 106 miles per hour inside the city limits. My Toyota did not obey to me anymore. Anything in my Toyota I was trying to do - FedEx was blocking me from doing this. I had to sell my Highlander. FedEx changed my favorite music application on my phone, - they changed the song words - to what FedEx wanted me to listen - their requirements to me. When I was coming to my Toyota - without me doing anything - FedEx was starting playing my music from my phone without my wish - through my JBL audio system in Toyota. Later FedEx killed my favorite music application and I can not use it anymore. FedEx broke remotely my Medtronic Minimed insulin pump and blew my Guardian wireless blood sugar sensor up on me under the tapes into the pieces. I reported this hacking to Medtronic Minimed. FedEx was blocking my most important calls, like to the clinics, and, muting my interview with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. I had to call from other phones. FedEx was disconnecting me from my internet and switching my Wi-Fi to airplane mode. VPN protection does not help at all. FedEx was reading in front of my eyes my emails and moving on my personal laptop screen the scroll bars as \u201cFedEx wish\u201d. It looks like a help desk took over your computer and doing something while you were watching them. FedEx idiots were discussing my personal life 24/7/365 on their conference calls on the speakers loudly and openly with a lot of witnesses at FedEx. Every day FedEx was talking at FedEx conference calls about - what I was doing and talking about a day before, what tone I was using, etc. FedEx employees asked me in the closed office: \u201cHow FedEx is Listening to me?\u201d \u2014 Then immediately FedEx \u201cmanager\u201d was called to RUN to us to STOP That TALK."

Expect to be going to bed by 7pm the latest, as you will be waking up at 2am to be there from 3am working till 8am. Bring a large bottle of water with you, as you will be working hard the entire time.\r\n\r\nPay and benefits for FedEx Ground (and privately owned) is probably the worst out of all the Fed Ex companies. If you are looking for pay and benefits, do not apply at a privately owned Fed Ex site. Also, apply for a Driver position instead.\r\n\r\nIn terms of job security at FedEx Ground, \u2018package handler\u2019 is an essential job. It\u2019s also your foot in the door as to how shipping companies work. If you can handle your schedule changing constantly, your job is secure.",

Oh, and you will not receive overtime.\r\n\r\nWhile FedEx has diversity, not all can assist you in lifting heavy packages. Expect to pick up packages as heavy as 100 lbs by yourself sometimes.\r\n\r\n Calling out is considered by management as a no/call no/show. Provide a dr note to manager if you need to call out."

During orientation they tell you the goal is 100 packages loaded an hour, this was a great pace not dangerous or hard if you're active and in shape leaving you time to load, organize, and stage your trucks. Now (about 6 or 7 months in) the pace is commonly 150-200 packages an hour, this is to cut labor hours I guess, to make the pace somewhat possible management and people from unload will come to help clean up your areas. Problem is (besides the inhumane treatment of employees) they need to help clean up because that pace causes you to constantly \"Stack out\" basically scan/drop your package to load when you can and keep doing that because you're taking 5 - 15 packages off the belt at the same time. When you're doing this all day you're more likely to damage packages, you're more likely to have tripping hazards, when you get large items it's very hard to make space for them, you will have a much harder time providing a quality load for your truck drivers. Heavy Items Hours (time and amount) Early odd hours to get the longer shifts, longer shifts are commonly less then 5hrs even for the best loaders who are kept on the longest. PTO is based off the hours posted on the schedule 3hrs perday (after 90days employed) Everything else with almost every low level labor jobs in the US."

FedEx is still Not leaving me alone (FedEx fired me in January 2022 for my excellent work there), - like - in this moment FedEx is hindering me to put my review here, - FedEx does not want anybody to know their Real Organized Criminal Gang FedEx face. FedEx hacked all of my personal electronics, including my Toyota, and, was deleting my personal files with my evidences against FedEx. Some files were completely ruined - I could see only the names of the files and nothing else. Some of my folders were emptied. My recorded calls with FedEx were deleted from my smart phone or edited - the recorded phrases were replaced with others (by the same voices). My voice mail messages on my phone were listened by FedEx on the purpose - before I knew about them. My adobe software on my laptop was constantly \u201cedited\u201d that I could not use it. Audio on my laptop is ruined. My accounts were blocked very often and my passwords were constantly changed. When I was going to a public computer in a library - it was the same, my accounts were blocked. I could not operate my Toyota Highlander with satellite connection - as I wanted, - they were stopping my navigation to work during my trip out of town and accelerating my Toyota to 106 miles per hour inside the city limits. My Toyota did not obey to me anymore. Anything in my Toyota I was trying to do - FedEx was blocking me from doing this. I had to sell my Highlander. FedEx changed my favorite music application on my phone, - they changed the song words - to what FedEx wanted me to listen - their requirements to me. When I was coming to my Toyota - without me doing anything - FedEx was starting playing my music from my phone without my wish - through my JBL audio system in Toyota. Later FedEx killed my favorite music application and I can not use it anymore. FedEx broke remotely my Medtronic Minimed insulin pump and blew my Guardian wireless blood sugar sensor up on me under the tapes into the pieces. I reported this hacking to Medtronic Minimed. FedEx was blocking my most important calls, like to the clinics, and, muting my interview with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. I had to call from other phones. FedEx was disconnecting me from my internet and switching my Wi-Fi to airplane mode. VPN protection does not help at all. FedEx was reading in front of my eyes my emails and moving on my personal laptop screen the scroll bars as \u201cFedEx wish\u201d. It looks like a help desk took over your computer and doing something while you were watching them. FedEx idiots were discussing my personal life 24/7/365 on their conference calls on the speakers loudly and openly with a lot of witnesses at FedEx. Every day FedEx was talking at FedEx conference calls about - what I was doing and talking about a day before, what tone I was using, etc. FedEx employees asked me in the closed office: \u201cHow FedEx is Listening to me?\u201d \u2014 Then immediately FedEx \u201cmanager\u201d was called to RUN to us to STOP That TALK."

Bring a large bottle of water with you, as you will be working hard the entire time.\r\n\r\nPay and benefits for FedEx Ground (and privately owned) is probably the worst out of all the Fed Ex companies. If you are looking for pay and benefits, do not apply at a privately owned Fed Ex site. Also, apply for a Driver position instead.\r\n\r\nIn terms of job security at FedEx Ground, \u2018package handler\u2019 is an essential job. It\u2019s also your foot in the door as to how shipping companies work. If you can handle your schedule changing constantly, your job is secure.",

Oh, and you will not receive overtime.\r\n\r\nWhile FedEx has diversity, not all can assist you in lifting heavy packages. Expect to pick up packages as heavy as 100 lbs by yourself sometimes.\r\n\r\n Calling out is considered by management as a no/call no/show. Provide a dr note to manager if you need to call out."

You put in 6%, they put in 8% instead of the old 3.5% match.\r\n\r\nIf you desire it, this company is very upwardly mobile and always hiring all over the place.
