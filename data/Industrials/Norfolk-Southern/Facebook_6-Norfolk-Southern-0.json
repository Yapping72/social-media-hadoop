The company is now hiring as fast as possible to account for the massive cuts made to the workforce.\n\nPay across crafts is the lowest of all Class I railroads. Pay for office personnel is not at all competitive with respective industries. Bonus pay at lower levels is based on \u201cindividual performance\u201d.

The review tiers are structured in such a way that if you perform your job well - you\u2019ll receive the lowest possible annual bonus rate. \n\nCommunication is atrocious. You\u2019ll have no official avenue to comment on the performance of management at any level. Performance reviews at Norfolk Southern are one-sided at best leaning towards farcical.\n\nNorfolk Southern offers nothing in terms of education reimbursement or career training if you\u2019re looking to further your career by taking online courses or college credits outside of work. The education reimbursement program was cancelled, abruptly a couple of years ago with no notice to employees enrolled in the program.\n\nThe company has made an absurd number of \u2018re-orgs\u2019 in the past few years. Most with no prior notification or planning. This lack of proper planning or communication obviously has an adverse effect on the systems, applications and processes that support day-to-day operations in the organization. \n\nIf you want to work somewhere where you\u2019ll be under-compensated, unappreciated, and forced to take on additional responsibilities at a moments whim without additional compensation - come to NS. If you want to work for a company that outwardly touts its \u201ccommitment to diversity\u201d while internally setting up \u201cdiversity councils\u201d consisting of an oddly homogenous group of males - come to NS.

Without a robust transportation system, America would never have become and remained so prosperous. Norfolk Southern continues to make commerce happen every day and touch the lives of hundreds of millions of people. I like being a very small piece of that.\r\n\r\nFor sure, the best benefit at NS is the triple retirement (401k with company match; company-funded pension; and railroad retirement instead of social security).  It is very possible to have a higher income during retirement than you did while you were working.  HR does regular surveys, and the retirement package is always the benefit that employees value most.  The retirement here is *really* hard to beat.\r\nThe other benefits are numerous. Of course we have comprehensive medical/dental/vision, but also some fringe benefits that are really nice: company match on your HSA contributions, on-site childcare (convenient but not free), pre-tax parking garage, discounts at various vendors, and company events/socials, and so forth. \r\n\r\nThere is tremendous opportunity for growth at NS. People change roles internally quite often, which results in employees with experience in lots of different areas. So you, as an employee, get to develop a lot of different skills and make a lot of connections.  Most people spend their entire careers working here \u2013 if you get bored, you can change to a completely different occupation without leaving the company. I\u2019ve been very fortunate so far to have a great team of coworkers and mangers, but there are people here who I think I\u2019d have a hard time working with/for.", "cons": "For non-union jobs, the more you get promoted, the more severely underpaid you become.  Each promotion comes with a raise, of course. But the raise is a percentage of your salary, dictated by some archaic HR policy.  Your new salary has absolutely nothing to do with your market value in your new position. Currently, I could do the exact same work somewhere else and make about 17% more money. The more promotions I get, the bigger this gap will become.  NS is pushing freight prices as high we can, trying to gain the maximum market value for the service we provide. But ironically, employees can\u2019t get the full market value of the service we provide. NS really needs to pay people their market value if we want to attract and retain top talent.\r\n\r\nSo, when you negotiate your starting salary, negotiate very hard. Get your base salary as high as absolutely possible. All of your future raises and bonuses will be a percentage of this initial salary.  Yes, extra vacation or a signing bonus are nice. But 10 years from now you will wish you had negotiated a higher base salary.\r\nFurthermore, your job title and job description have nothing whatsoever to do with what you\u2019ll actually do from day to day.  I just so happen to love what I do, but I\u2019d never have guessed that based on my title or job description.  I\u2019ve had 4 different job titles and 4 different job descriptions with NS, none of which were remotely close to describing my actual work, and all of which I could\u2019ve earned a higher salary elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMy management has never established any written, measurable performance goals for me. I have no idea how my performance will be evaluated.  When it comes time for my performance review at the end of each year, it will be a complete surprise to find out whether I \u201cneed improvement,\u201d am a \u201csolid performer\u201d, or an \u201cexceptional performer.\u201d  Furthermore, I have no recourse if I disagree with my review, because it is not based on any measurable figures. My review is simply the arbitrary opinion of a group of leaders many levels of management above me, who have no idea what I do, much less whether I am doing it well. And everyone is judged to a different standard.  I want so much to be exceptional, and I\u2019m sure the company wants me to do exceptional work, but there is no way for me to know what it takes to be considered exceptional. \r\n\r\nAlso on the subject of performance, the performance reviews are required to follow a bell curve. Meaning that a department can only give \u201cexceptional\u201d to a certain percentage of their top employees.  Your performance review has little to do with how well you met your goals; it has to do with how well you met your goals relative to how well everyone else met their goals. I think NS could deliver much better results if we built teams of only high performers. \r\n\r\nIt is especially frustrating because people\u2019s annual bonus depends on their performance review.  In order to get the bigger bonus, you have to be reviewed as exceptional.  So even if you have a legitimate objection to your review, it just sounds like you are whining because you didn\u2019t get a bigger bonus. \r\n\r\nIf you are in a non-unionized field position, there can be lots of moving.  I\u2019ve talked with one guy who\u2019s moved 12 times in 10 years.  The company pays for the entire move; the employee never has to lift a finger. But that can be a very hard lifestyle. On the other hand, office jobs are almost all located in Atlanta, so if you\u2019re taking a headquarters job there is very little moving.  \r\n\r\nThere is an expectation of constant work.  Nights, weekends, even on vacation, people are checking and responding to emails and phone calls, and doing work.  There is little separation between work and personal life. You\u2019re in the office from 8-5, but the work never really stops.  You\u2019re given the flexibility to leave for doctor appointments, sick days, car repairs, and so forth. But in return, you have to be available 24/7. In my opinion, if one individual is so critical that they have to be reachable 24/7, then there is a fundamental flaw in the business structure. What happens if that person suddenly has a heart attack? We need to be able to detach ourselves after hours and decompress with our families. That is key to a long and successful career.\r\n\r\nNS is under constant pressure to please shareholders.  One of the drawbacks of a publically-traded company, is that we are working at the whim of Wall Street.  We have limited ability to make our own decisions about what is best for the long-term future of the company, we are only able to do what is best in the eyes of the investors \u2013 usually, that means short-term profits and an operating ratio lower than some other railroad.

The bosses do not know anything about anything it seems like yet they are in charge of a mechanical department and dont even know what a wrench is(I am not exagerating). They will bust you for stupid things like not putting your emergency brake on your truck when you park it and will go out of there way to try and bust you. That's just one example of many. It seems like They do anything in there power to make it miserable for the employees. They took away our bonuses that we used to get every year of $1000 but they will always brag about the company making record profits every year/quarter. They change jobs around all the time and have been changing jobs with weekends off to days off in the middle of the week for no reason other then to make the employees mad. If the bosses don't like you they will keep abolishing your job until you finally bump on a job that you dont like. You are always being harrast especially when you actually do your job the way your supposed to meaning a full fra inspection and you will really be harrast and have a target on your back (like I have) if you shop cars and find defects like your supposed to do according to federal regulations. For example: I was pulled into the office for taking to long on my freight car inspections and was threatend to be reprimanded if I do not work faster so I started to work my cars faster until I got reprimanded for missing a defect on a car that FRA found so now I am back to doing my original thorough inspection and now I am being hurrast again for taking to long and findimg to many defects. Let me remind you that if the FRA(federal railroad administratoin) inspects my cars after I do and finds defects I will be reprimanded for missing it like I was before. You can't win. And this isnt just how they treat me this is how they treat everyone. That is why everone has been quiting and the bosses can't seem to figure out why.

They favor whatever shifts they decide could be more productive and have limited job postings that have weekends off. A refusal to favor weekends off is common. Vacations are limited to seniority and available slots per craft per shift. Low roster members are frequently only able to get pre-April vacations. You may be stuck working night-shift with Tuesday/Wednesday off and your 2 weeks of vacation in March for 5+ years. \"Someone else can take your child to the hospital.\" was said to an employee asking what they should do if an emergency at home arises.\r\n\r\nLimited Progression - Progressing your career from an agreement position is very limited. You can move into management a couple steps but must move to another location before progressing further. Most administrative jobs are located in Atlanta and they do not entertain telework. Education assistance has been removed for agreement employees.\r\n\r\nRefusal to change culture - The culture has continued to deteriorate over a decade of my career. Craft employees are miserable and have a strong distaste for management. Supervision and management walk around with their noses high in the air. Local Unions do not have a foot to stand on and layoffs are common. Over the last few years, all bonuses/gifts/meals for craft employees have been removed. After the decision was made to remove all extras, a corporate email was sent to everyone (intended only for non-agreement employees) speaking of how well the company was doing and how bonuses may be the highest they've ever been. They promote diversity, opportunity and the \"development of people\", however, that starts and stops at Atlanta.\r\n\r\nHypocrisy/Deceit - Management is quick to punish employees to the fullest extent for the lightest rule infractions (small tears in clothing, not having a \"good enough grip\", or stepping on rails which are level with walking platforms) but are frequently seen breaking the same rules. Employees do not report supervision/management due to the fear of retaliation. Education Assistance has been used to give employees a choice between their tuition reimbursement (and signing disciplinary acceptance paperwork) or going to investigation and risking their assistance (formal discipline voids your reimbursement and you are required to repay the previous 12 months). Supervision has a required quota for writing employees up. It is a \"requirement\".\r\n\r\nManagement frequently changes. Locations are seen as stepping stones and management is looking to add a feather to their hat at each location so they can move up the corporate ladder. Work tasks, packets, sign-off sheets, and rules frequently change or flop back and forth depending on who is in charge. All changes made in the last 5 years can be cut in an instant when new management steps in. Everyone thinks their idea is the greatest and wants to add their \"improvement\" to their resume/profile. The focus should be on the company/location as a whole, not the individual themselves.\r\n\r\nSecurity is never guaranteed. Layoffs have become very common. Push back against corporate plans can lead to termination (even if you are offering positive advice). Challenging current practices can get you a letter in your file.
