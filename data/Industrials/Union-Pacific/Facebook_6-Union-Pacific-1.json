Pay close attention to the reviews of union pacific because the departments are drastically different. Managers and office people are in a whole different universe than the folks throwing switches and turning wrenches. The mechanical department employs craftspeople who work on the Locomotives: Electricians, Machinists (mechanics), Sheet metal workers (welders and pipefitters), and Laborers (MSO's or Fireman & Oilers). Unlike non-railroad union trades you pay for your healthcare and pension out of your check so subtract $5 an hour from whatever the current rates is and that's more realistic for calculating take home pay. The job training is laughable, most recently hired electricians have a construction background which doesn't translate well to locomotives. You will be put with a mentor who will teach you the wrong and quick way to do every task. The company has training instructors that hold official classes BUT they can only teach 3 to 5 people at a time for some unknown reason and all they do is show you a powerpoint. I received Locomotive familiarization class a few months after I had started working on locomotives which shows how much the company cares. You are going to be expected to do work you have no training for and then you will have to sign government documents saying you did it properly. Most of the tasks you do in the mechanical department are Federal Railroad Administration (government) required maintenance tasks. The company doesn't care about these things and the foreman and your fellow workers will encourage you to just sign off a lot of tasks without actually doing them. I have been yelled at by foreman for doing work properly because it was a waste of time. Following company and FRA rules is a waste of time to the mechanical department. Safety is stressed from day one but you will see by the pathetic facilities that it's just for show. The PPE is nice but locomotive blue flag lockout equipment is not adequate. Smoking and cell phones are not allowed even though people smoke everywhere and are always on their cell phones, in fact foreman and workers communicate exclusively with personal cellphones on the job even though it's against company policy to even have a phone on you at work. Working for UP is like a football game, the referees can call a penalty on every play if they really wanted to. The rule book is thick like a bible and open to managerial interpretation so no matter what you do you're probably doing something wrong. The company has completely incompetent leadership at every level. They claim to use the Toyota management model where every workers input and suggestions will be heard, but that is just not true. If you (the low level employee) sees a problem or an opportunity for improvement and you tell a manager or foreman the only response you will get is \"put it in the solution center\" (in a heavily condescending tone). Solution center is a computer program where you enter your suggestions and someone from management will get back to you. Do you know how many mechanics and electricians care enough to follow through this process? Not many, so things remain unpleasant. Tools and equipment remain broken for months because the system depends on the lowest level employee taking all the responsibility for improvement, it's not working UP."}, {"review_title": "Management", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 May 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Railroad retirement ik nstead of social security. \r\nHistorically opportunities to work multiple departments.", "cons": "Terrible management health ins , very very political instead of based on work and daily contributions.

You get an idea of when you might get called, then try to adjust life and rest accordingly, (usually a 2 hr call), but that can change in an hour (people lay  off ahead of you, phantom trains pop up, etc.).  then you have to decide whether to lay off sick, costing you two days pay, or to throw water in your face and live on coffee for 12 hours with no or little sleep.  THIS IS NOT A JOB FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS TO GET 6-8 HOURS OF REGULAR SLEEP A NIGHT.  No shifts, you'll be called when your turn comes up; could be any hours day or night.   \r\n\r\nOutside conditions can be tough, although most engines  now have AC and sufficient heat (not so 30 years ago.)  \r\n\r\nVery responsible position, so many rules and regulations to keep up with.

If you don't pay attention, the chance of injury is always lurking.  \r\n\r\nWhen the work force is poorly allocated, you are under pressure to work too much.  Pay is good, but its hard on the body and home life.  And again, the unpredictability of on-duty times can break a person down.

This varies by railroad and location.  Some terminals are managed by railroaders with experience who know to let the men do the work with as little interference as possible.  Others are people who were hired out of college with little work experience, (I'm not anti-college, I have a degree.)  and then are drilled to constantly be doing road tests for finding violations and subsequent discipline.  Most RR's require their managers to perform so many tests per month.  The poorly managed ones even require so many FAILURES  per month.  (how's that for pessimism.)  Again, this varied greatly over the years, and I'm sure it still does - highly dependent on the tone set by the local superintendent or district manager.  Over my 30 years it was about 50/50.

This is not an exaggeration. \r\n- The only way you can get time off is by \"Laying Off Sick\" (basically calling in sick).. However, this is highly monitored by the managers and there is a ridiculous formula they use to determine if you're doing this to often. Also, since there are NO paid sick days off, be prepared to lose an average of $600 each time you call in if your a through freight employee.\r\n- While at home, you will have 10 hours that they cannot call you to work, after that you are free game for them to call you in. \r\n- The biggest problem is the separation between Managers and Train Crews. The managers are required to test the employees on all rules and operations while they are in the field running trains. The problem with this is that the rule book is literally 4 inches thick and it changes DAILY. So, things that were okay to do yesterday will get you fired today. So, even if you stay up on all the changes your manager might not and since a majority of them have never even been on a train, their interpretation of the rule could be wrong. Now, I don't want to say that managers are always to blame because the crews mess up plenty but just imagine going to work everyday knowing that instead of having a Manager that's going to lead, motivate and manage crews that you're going to have to worry about them surprising you with a test after you've been working all night and firing you.\r\n- If you want to be a crew member on a Through Freight Train expect to stay in some of the worst hotels you can imagine.

All lies. The insanely hectic schedule is worth 100K a year, but I've never made more that 40K in a year. You are 24/7/365 on - call, you never know your days off.... good luck scheduling anything. You can call out sick to schedule stuff, but do it too much and you're fired. That type of horrible schedule is worth 100K a year, but you won't be making that. You're not going to start off making a lot of money, It takes like 15 years to get to the 100K mark even though they'll tell you differently. Everyone you know will say that it's a great job and you should take it, but none of them have ever worked for the railroad. I was furloughed (no pay or benefits) four times my first year, I barely made 15K. Most people get a side job to keep them afloat during a furlough, but when the railroad calls you back, you need to start working for them within 30 days or you're fired. Hopefully you can get a decent side gig that won't mind you coming and going as you please, because you'll need it. There are guys with 10 years of seniority that are on the verge of being furloughed, so expect it for a third of your career. The union keeps selling out the new guys so the old guys continue getting hooked up, I seriously doubt it will even be possible to break 100K in the future with how much the union bends over for the company. I got two vacation days for my first year and a half, one week after that. You don't get to choose when you take your vacation, the union decides for you. I think the job is going to get reduced a lot in the future with the implementation of automated equipment. The retirement is okay, but they take out ~15 percent of every pay check, if you put that into an IRA for 30 years you're going to have a good retirement regardless of where you work. If the retirement was so awesome, the old guys would retire, but they don't. The company doesn't match a 401K. Do not make any major purchases for at least 10 years. I know so many guys that lost a house, had their commuter cars (civic, corolla, etc.) repossessed, and were out of health insurance when they needed it most. Basically I would only recommend this job for desperate individuals, train enthusiasts, and people that don't need a consistent pay check or health insurance. The company wants to own your entire life when they need you, and toss you to the curb when they don't.

Field managers work 90+ hours on road territories and are on call 24 hours of each work day. Terminal managers work 55-70 hours per week however they are fighting fires every minute of it. Its not just the hours that create the poor work life balance, it\u2019s the stress. When you get home you are so on edge about your operation you can\u2019t unwind. \r\n2) Culture: this is the biggest con by far. The company expects you as a manager to be a authoritarian dictator. I have a collaborative leadership style which is quite opposite of the authoritarian. I tried to lead my way and eventually you have no choice but to play their game and lead their way... otherwise the other managers who do lead their way will shine well above you and you will earn a target on your back. Their style over the years has instilled a negative mindset into every agreement professional\u2019s head and had burned out a lot of good managers. \r\n3) Cost Cutting: Union Pacific is implementing precision schedule railroading which is effectively a major cost cutting effort. I believe PSR is good in a lot of respects. Everyone knows there is opportunity for our company to be more efficient with its money. Unfortunately we have cut too deep in key resources such as locomotives.

I have had oppertunities to make almost 100,000 a year but it requires giving the company 80 to 100 hours a week of my time working and being away from home \"which by the way they don't pay you for when they force you out of town or to stay in their disgusting unclean company hotels\"! It was a good place to work but the way they treat their employees is inhumane and degrading now. Also the  pay hasn't kept up with inflation and now I make a smidge more than some of the college kids serving and restaurants! That is based off a 40 hour work week. You could make more but will have to work a road trio for 12 to 14 hours then stay in a dirty railroad hotel away from your family for 16 hours and work another 12 to 14 hour train back to your hometown. Then you will get 10 to 12 hours with your family \"most of which you will use to sleep\" then do the 40 to 44 hour trip all over again! Then you might make 100,000 a year but you gotta do that all year long! Also the medical benefits used to be top notch. Now it is comparable to any other average job out there so don't let them fool you by saying they are good because they used to be but not anymore. \r\n\r\n      The union can never get decent pay raises either. It doesn't matter what president is in office they always get tiny pay raises with contracts  and boost that they did a good job negotiating.  In comparison my pay is about 75% higher than when I hired out 20 years ago. But the average house in my area costs 300% more than 20 years ago. Food is at least 100% more. Cars are like 150% more. Utilities are 200% more, And just about everything I can think of has at least doubled. My pay hasn't doubled that's for sure! It's not even close to average inflation. If you factor in $400 the union takes per month and how much monthly  insurance is taken out then my 75% increase in pay over 20 years goes down even more. Then the union takes $400 bucks a month, \"that includes job insurance which you pretty much have to buy because you WILL get fired at some point for something.\" Anyways this old dog doesn't like learning nee tricks so I trying to hold out for retirement but if your young and considering the Union Pacific take my advice and go to college and get a job that will make you happy.

It's been over a year since I left and I still get upset when I think deeply about my time with UP.\r\n\r\nWell first off I have to say the culture was terrible. Nobody seemed to care about anything, much less completing the minimum assigned tasks. When work was performed it would be only what was explicitly assigned. Nobody owned their work or took pride in what they did.\r\n\r\nThe unions and management have a terrible relationship. I often felt like I was caught in between 2 divorced parents when dealing with the two, and in the end I resented both of them for it.\r\n\r\nWhen I would insist on doing my job correctly and tried to favor long term solutions over short term fixes management would likely be upset, or indifferent at a minimum. For example: One of my coworkers at my current job quit working at UP after only a few weeks after getting into an argument with a foreman where the foreman was upset the he had done his job correctly and in accordance with federal, and company standards.\r\n\r\nFor a time I helped install PTC equipment on locomotives. This was a task the company grudgingly completed and it showed. After failing to meet deadline after deadline the company would complain to congress about how difficult it was and how hard they were trying. This got them yet another extension. The company then turned around and laid-off over 50% of the installers. \r\n\r\nMy problem wasn't with the work. I actually enjoyed what I did, but every day felt like an ethical compromise. \r\n\r\nThe company simply doesn't care about job performance or customer satisfaction.

You\u2019re also bothered when on vacation and are never really \u201caway\u201d. Many times, I\u2019d work 60-70+ hours each week and still had to be on-call regardless. \r\n2. Long hours. The ones in the \u201cglass palace\u201d work a modest 8-5 with a lunch break and have time to go to the on-site gym. The ones at the Harriman work a minimum of 10-hour days with no lunch (they can\u2019t tell you that you CAN\u2019T take a lunch, but it\u2019s frowned upon to leave and get something to eat. Most just eat at their desks).\r\n3. The HDC also does not have a gym on-site for employees to use. It\u2019s a mile and a half from the UP HQ building, so it would be impossible to get a workout in over lunch. \r\n4. Incompetent management and nepotism runs rampant. People are promoted based upon their popularity rather than their skill level, tenure, and knowledge of the railroad. \r\n5. Management and directors will block people from interviewing for promotions because they\u2019re worried about losing good employees. \r\n6. Management and directors will also hold employees for MONTHS until a replacement is hired. Oftentimes, the new department rescinds their offer because they can\u2019t get the employee in time, leading to the employee not getting a promotion they rightfully earned. \r\n7. Unrealistic expectations set forth by management.\r\n8. Attitude from subordinates that are never addressed by senior leadership, which leads to a negative work environment. Everyone is constantly walking on eggshells as to not say something that may get them subject to an EEO investigation. \r\n9. Participation in work-related groups and events is discouraged by managers, even though they want us to be involved in activities per our TPT/performance review. Lose/lose situation here.\r\n10. CONSTANT layoffs. There have been a round of layoffs every single year I was here, with more coming. The executives don\u2019t understand the bigger picture.
