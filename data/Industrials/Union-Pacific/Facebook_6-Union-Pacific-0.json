Often you spend over 24 hours in a hotel away from home, which resets your consecutive days worked under the Federal Rest law, which prevents you from earning 48 hours off at home, so now they can make you work even more without seeing your family. Upper management is totally out of touch with their workforce and the work they do; they preach safety and caring, but only act upon maximizing profits for themselves and shareholders with no regard to how it actually impacts the people doing the work that brings in their record profits. Then they task lower management with handing down discipline to employees who make even the slightest petty infringement on rule compliance. We must follow all rules at all times, but management is free to bend and break rules whenever it suits their convenience with nothing more than signing their initials to it. Even though this job is union protected, the union has little power against the company. Federal law prohibits the unions from striking except under certain circumstances.

Most of your co workers will spread gossip and misinformation based on what they heard someone else say they heard from a guy who was talking to someone that heard about a situation that somebody else heard about.\r\n\r\nmost people are more concerned with what everyone else is doing than minding their own business, and someone always has something to say about how they think you aren't doing what they think you should be doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only thing Union Pacific truly cares about is that you are available to answer the phone and show up to work your train.

Meaning if I was to have more time than someone else and I have them on established rights, I can \"bump him\" meaning I took his position. Then, the man that I \"bumped\" has to now find someone he has time over and \"bump\" them. It may sound very confusing, lol but trust me it's actually pretty simple. And cutoffs.... Especially the past 2 years, we've been getting cutoff towards the end of the year. But at the beginning of the year the jobs had been put back out. But HOPEFULLY that is over with.
