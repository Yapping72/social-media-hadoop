Time off can practically be thrown out the door. Doesn't matter if you have family affairs going on or even if a loved one dies, if you're manager doesn't like or know you all that well you're stuck with your schedule. And if you call out or miss a few days when you don't have PPT you're screwed. They threaten termination with everything. Training is strict too for a minimum of 10 weeks and then you're in a probation period for 6 months. Meanwhile on the actual job, aka; taking phone calls, they offer no support or assistance. As well you have to transfer 80% of your calls cause they don't train you for the information until after 3 months (within the first 6 months) and only if your stats look the way they want them to. They micromanage you and watch your every move too. They measure your performance with arbitrary numbers and surveys but can't comprehend that calls you get are the luck of the draw. They also look down on transfers out of reservations and opt against it no matter where you try to transfer to. They put on a fa\u00e7ade of caring for your well being and your health but when that stuff interferes with work they're suddenly not so caring. They also blatantly show favoritism, so watch out there. They base a lot of stuff on seniority - which can be great but nowadays with how many new employees there are it's ridiculous. They promote moving on up within the company but you can't do anything unless you've been there longer than a year, but almost 60% of res is new employees now. Management doesn't care either unless a big figurehead or a VP comes around.

You arrive they split you into 3 groups each group is assigned a task. One group will do their F2F, the other group will have a Q&A where if you\u2019re wanting the job ask as many questions as possible. During this section they will be doing a jump seat test where the belt is only about 18 in around (smaller than a regular airplane seatbelt) but there are bigger people as FA don\u2019t let that scare you. and a test to see if you can reach the the storage cabins on a Boeing 737. The 3rd group will be doing a cart activity where you need to read the instructions in full, delegate who does what, work and talk as a team, they don\u2019t give you any feedback the entire time so you\u2019re just guessing, you\u2019re putting on the drinks, ice trays, snacks and lunches there even is a peanut allergy so watch that. (it\u2019s only a 10 minute exercise work fast) They give you no instructions other than to read the paper. (google what an airline cart looks like). After all task are completed they break you down into zones 1, 2, and 3 if your are escorted out in the first group you didn\u2019t get it, second group is a maybe, and there\u2019s group that stays you hit the job you will do your fingerprint and drug test in spot. They give you really good encouraging words but I\u2019d rather have honesty they lie to your face saying wait for an email when they no you didn\u2019t get it. Training is for 6 weeks and is it $7.25 where you work 50 hours a week. Pay after training is $32.50 based on flight hours when the cabin doors close a $2.48 per diem if you are not home or moving and are still on company time. Everybody is super fake friendly to the point where they\u2019ll compliment your whole outfit but they no you\u2019re not the right pick. Currently as of November 2022 they only have an offering of the worse airports, you will only work domestic flights as a Junior FA as they told us a lot of Oklahoma, Idaho, South Dakota random places like that. So if you\u2019re doing it for the thrill and wanting to travel I recommend trying a different airline the senior FA get first grabs of flying abroad. If you live where there isn\u2019t any bases you will have to either commute which can lead you to paying for your own hotel if you are left somewhere or taking your days off to travel ahead of time to your base. Or to move and there is no moving package it\u2019s all on you financially to move. I got all the way to the F2F on my first try and I won\u2019t be applying again as you have to wait 6 months. Just move on to another airline that promises to have you home every night and have relocation packages.

Schedules are flexible, you will have 6 on call days a month rather than a full reserve schedule (very rare for a new hire, most if not all other airlines put new flight attendants on straight reserve) but keep in mind you will have these 6 on call days for years before you have enough seniority.\r\n\r\nStandards at Delta are very high.

They lack the opportunities for their frontline employees, to progress professionally, which makes any form of upward mobility, seem like a far fetched dream. No training programs in place, no tuition reimbursement, only some small discounts on overpriced online colleges. Pretty much as frontline employee, I professionally feel that, management has been negligent on investing into their human capital. The culture has somewhat changed, in the last couple of years, with the departure of our previous CEO. I professionally feel, that morale is at an all time low, and with that being said, the turnover rate will start to increase if, management fails to address the issues as stated above. Their is too much of an emphasis on metrics, especially from lower level management. Not many corporate or merit positions, outside of Atlanta, which is the headquarters, and the lacking of remote opportunities. I feel that our customers, have better technology through their apps on their phone, than we do as an agent assisting customers. For example, we use computers that have Windows 7 OS, and currently, Windows OS is on its 11th edition. I don't even need to further explain the absurdity which I just mentioned.
