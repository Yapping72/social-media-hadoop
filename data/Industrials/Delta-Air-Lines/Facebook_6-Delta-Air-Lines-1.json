Delta doesn't care. Recently, they've gotten in a lot of trouble regarding lobbying the CDC to make it so that employees who have covid have to come back to work after 5 days. Well, I BELIEVE IT. In training they tell you that calling out (especially in your first 6 months) will more than likely result in probation (ranging anywhere from a year to 3 years) I knew SO MANY people, especially new hires who were TERRIFIED to call out even when deathly ill. I recall one particular situation where I was flying with a new FA and her eardrums were about to rupture and she was SOBBING next to me on the jumpseat because she was in so much pain but was unable to call out because she had already called out for food poisoning a month prior and her manager told her if she called out again she would be put on extended probation. Delta cares about profit NOT people. \r\nManagement is NOT there for you. They are there to keep score and tabs on you for the slightest mistake to get rid of you. Your punishment for whatever you did or didn't do is also based on which manager you have. Some managers are more reasonable and some will fire you without coaching or help. You are disposable.

This was a quirk of the CAM software being used (CAMWorks, which saves CAM data inside the Solidworks 3d models). The upshot is that every time a shipset came through the shop, CNC programmers would have to regenerate programs for every single component to verify that the GCode to be run in the shop matched the current drawing released by Engineering. Including Production CAM work with Engineering models was in process at the time I left, but there were rampant issues with Engineering's 3d models not adhering to ASME Y14.41 (read: 3d models did not accurately match the 2D drawing specifications, and CNC programmers had to make adjustments to models until they matched the prints, then generate CNC programs, etc.--this is why CNC programmers were having to constantly re-do the work on every shipset, this work could not be saved back into the system for future use/reference to have a clear evidence trail from Engineering to the programs posted for previous shipsets).\r\n\r\n-Engineering had a terrible habit of referencing industry standards on their released prints that CNC programmers and other shop personnel did not have access to (because they did not have Engineering roles, so the system would not allow us to view those standards for reference). A detailed audit of time spent on various shop operations would reveal an astronomical waste of time spent asking Engineers to tell people at various stages of production what a specific standard meant for the feature in question in terms of dimension/finish/etc."}, {"review_title": "good job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Ramp Agent in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "fly benefits, overtime and good management", "cons": "hard work short staffing.

That sounds great, until its actually time to live by them. Management frequently targets employees who they don't like. They will scour the internet trying to dig up dirt on employees, who have done nothing wrong, to bring disciplinary action against the unwanted. As proof, Delta recently lost a whistle blower case where a pilot reported safety concerns and management responded by requiring the pilot to submit to a medical review where they subsequently paid a doctor (who has since lost his license to practice) $73,000 who diagnosed the pilot with bipolar disorder, a diagnosis that would permanently ground a pilot. The pilot went to the Mayo Clinic to dispute the diagnosis and a board unanimously found the pilot did not have bipolar disorder. The diagnosis cost $3200. Delta lost the judgement and is ordered to pay the pilot $500,000. All of the managers and lawyers still work here expect for one. Most have been promoted and the one who doesn't work here is now the head of the FAA.\n\nStill don't believe me. Google \"Labor Dept. rules Delta discriminated against whistleblower pilot\" and you will see the ruling for yourself\n\n-benefits are terrible. You will pay thousands in premiums and deductibles before Delta pays a penny. Walmart of all places has better benefits.\n-pay is subpar. Delta likes to talk about \"Total compensation\" which includes profit sharing. Well, a profit sharing of $0 doesn't pay many bills. This year for profit sharing day I was given a king sized Kit Kat candy bar\n-management loves to put out propoganda about how much they appreciate everything employees are doing and then turns around and throws any agreements they have made out the window.\n-flight benefits are great if you can find an open seat. Delta is in the business of filling airplanes which isnt helpful when you fly stand by.\n-they will try to outsource your job to the lowest bidder. Heavy MX checks....outsourced to Mexico and China. Regional jets.....outsourced. Gate agents, ramp agents, ticket agents and catering all over the world.....outsourced. Delta even owns some of the companies they outsource work to so they can pay employees less\n\nOverall, there is simply a lack of respect for employees. Management lacks the integrity and honesty to uphold their side of agreements.
