Southwest lacks diversity in leadership roles and actively overlook POC for roles when considering Senior Manager and above positions. \r\n2.) Southwest is a place where you will have to spend 3+ years before you are promoted. Promotions are not based on hard work but rather who you know. \r\n3.) Working hard and creating great work does not matter at Southwest. What matters is who you suck up to. That is the only thing that will get you promoted. \r\n4.) The culture at SWA was really fun when I first joined 5 years ago. But since then, consultants have taken over the company and the company culture has changed for the worse. \r\n5.) In past years, we use to be at the top of the \"Best Places to Work in America\" list. We've dropped a lot. Internal Employee satisfactions scores are ABYSMAL. \r\n6.) For the past two years, most of us worked from home. WFH policies across the department are not all equal. \r\n7.) There is no work life balance. During COVID, most of us were working 12 hours a day. \r\n8.) Salaries are ridiculously low. On average, someone in my role at SWA makes about $115 to $130. That same role, people outside of SWA would make about $150 to $165. \r\n9.) We have flight benefits but no PTO to even use them. \r\n10.) It has become a revolving door at SWA.

The things you hear are 100% true. I don't feel the need to cover the positives extensively as that has been done everywhere. If you have the luck of interviewing or taking a job at SWA you will not regret it - it's an absolutely amazing company with incredible People, culture, and opportunity. BUT - be aware whats most important to you out of a job & company, and recognize that may change over time, as there are some drawbacks and no place is perfect.\n\n1. Amazing People and culture \n2. Benefits are incredible - flight perks, 401k, profit sharing, etc. \n3. You will feel apart of the mission, and what a wonderful mission.\n4. Stability - no layoffs even through covid.", "cons": "1. The People and culture - while listed above, this can also create a very challenging environment. My department was a bit \"cliquish\"and the Director tended to also have his favorites who were awarded projects and the recognition. Personal Ideas, improvements, and projects are encouraged, but only if it fits into the strategy box set by Leadership. If you tend to challenge the status quo you might find yourself a bit annoyed here and constantly having to \"disagree & commit\". Positivity, agreeance, and personal projects over innovation, high performance, and utility/cohesiveness. Also, poor performance tends to slip under the cracks and is never truly addressed.\n\n2. Compensation - I have heard there have been improvements here, but SWA still falls on the lower end for many roles. They emphasize the benefits (which are great) but in a world where cash in hand is increasingly more important - their salaries miss the mark. This is also accentuated by the internal compensation philosophy and poor job architecture - which doesn't reward monetarily but by opportunity. \"We are going to promote you into a Manager role because you are doing amazing, but you don't have Manager experience so we are only going to adjust your salary by 5% and put you at the absolute bottom of an already low range which you will constantly be trying to recover from\". At the end of the day, it is a low-cost carrier and pay increases once you are in, are just not great. I received a 50% pay increase when I left and got a bigger raise in the first year than I got the entire time I worked at SWA..... \n\n3. Work-life balance - Feeling apart of a mission can be great. It can also throw WLB out of the window, and cause you to become emotionally involved when things are going great. SWA has a way of making work being heavily integrated into your life (which again is one of the pros - its alot of fun with great people who become friends/family) but it also can really stretch WLB. \"if this doesn't get done, I'm letting my customers (friends/family) down\". While Im sure it varies by department, my work/life balance disappeared for a while and I was working 10-12 hour days just to keep up with an unreasonable workload as I didn't want to let my customers down. Referring back to number 2. there was a real lack of awareness (potentially care) of the ridiculous workloads our Team was trying to manage.\n\n4. Change - I almost didn't put this, as im sure People will discount me as the person who just hates change. Change is necessary, hard, and fantastic. I love progression and finding new ways of working and efficiencies. BUT - The strategy for my department was constantly changing to a point where it became difficult to get any thing done. My director had the tendency to chase the next shiny tool and buzz word, which left our Teams scrambling to make things work. Change for the sake of change, in too large of chunks, without a cohesive vision/strategy, and without the understanding of day to day tactical work is futile."}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 May 2022", "job_title": "Market Strategy Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits currently \nStrong Leadership\nCo-hearts\nSkill development", "cons": "Pay vs cost of living"}, {"review_title": "Awesome, Awesome Company!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Ramp Agent in Oklahoma City, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free Flights, Great people, paid uniforms, overtime whenever you want, great 401K, multiple career advancements and transfers after 6 months!", "cons": "None!
