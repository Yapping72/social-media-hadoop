Most locations will just feel like standard bland corporate fair.\r\n\r\n- While senior leadership and the sustainability team are thinking about and working on how to transition our economy to one that produces less trash or 0 waste and recycles everything to create a cradle-to-cradle model, the area teams from the route managers to the vice presidents are not really in support of this vision. My manager would often ask me why I was trying to sell recycling accounts.\r\n\r\n- As an outside rep you are pretty much doing things the exact same way that that position has operated probably since it has existed...drive around and walk into any business that doesn't have a green can. Waste Management has an unGODLY amount of data in their salesforce CRM and could leverage this so much more effectively to make more intelligent sales.\r\n\r\n- Realizing how the financials in the waste business actually function may leave a bad taste in your mouth. They will offer competitive rates at first to win business, and from there on out will essentially pray that that company doesn't pay enough attention to their bill to realize they are getting reamed by price increases year over year. This basically means that instead of valuing long time customers they will gladly rip off churches, schools, etc. for 7, 8 , 9, 10 dollars a yard if they aren't vigilant over their own bill, know how to read the contract and fight it, or if they don't have a rate cap to start with.\r\n\r\n- Waste Management is indeed the largest in the industry, but that is mainly because it makes very astute acquisitions (ie their recent purchase of Advanced Disposal) and performs savvy financial moves rather than actually having superior customer service, ops, reporting, or anything of real value to the customer to justify their high bill from WM for the exact same service that Republic or WCN or a solid local hauler could do for much less.

Not to mention adding unessarry Extra fees and yearly increases to the bill. You would be upset too. Waste management is all about maximizing profits for its stock holders and getting the most out their employees for the least amount of money. At least pay your employees what their worth. Most of my co-workers are college educated and with above average intelligence and very talented people. How they ended up in a low paying dead end job I don't know? Due to the economy it seems many people has to scale down to this job until they find something better.  Most people come in and try to tranfer into other departments or bolt soon as a better opportunity comes along. Or remain trapped. \r\n\r\nI basically sat in a cubical and had to put up with angry rude customs all day. You have to really take multi tasking to the next level working with 10 different computer programs at once including operating systems while talking/typing super fast and answering calls back to back. It can be stressful at first. It's a skill that comes in time. You can't even leave the building for lunch because they give you only 30 mins. For the amount of abuse and workload given at this job isn't worth the low hourly wage. Nobody cares about providing quality or focusing on good customer service here. It's about hitting your numbers and getting the customer off the phone to take the next call so your numbers look good. It's a call center where irate customers call in to scream and let out all their frustrations for being over charged or not having their trash picked up on time. You have to smile and be a door mat basically. I had to learn about 1000 new acronyms to input new tickets and cases. Reps do it all for a low wage. \r\n  The DOS system is outdated and the sales force program wastes too much time and adds busy work while trying to close a sale. Don't even think to ask a manager for any help because they will roll their eyes at you or make some smart comment and try to avoid you if you need assistance.  It's better to tell the customer what they want to hear and take the next call. I had no patients to wait for a manager to come help me. So I stopped asking for help.  They just don't care. \r\n\r\nAll the employees are also graded several core factors from talk time, hold times to adherence. Your a slave that is tied down in a cube until the end of your shift. If your one minute late logging on into the phone system you are screwed. Management will say something to you.  You have 20 different passwords that you need to log into different programs. Then you have unessarry emails constantly being sent that need to be completed including additional on going usless computer training quizzes and other usless mind numbing work. After a while you get used to all this madness and you are bear after each day. I see it in the faces of all my peers. They are exhausted and count down the seconds to go home.  I felt like a caged animal being and trapped half the time with a head set infused over my head 8 hours a day. Its not healthy to sit for so many hours.  Yes no job is perfect I get it.

Beginning in 2012, to take away this corporate benefit, the current management has written an attendance policy that penalizes you for taking any of the 40 hours of sick time.  You are given 1 point for each and every time (1 hour or whole day) that you use this time.  After 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 points, you are then given a verbal warning.  Further points lead to termination.  Even though you still have remaining sick time hours.  \r\nThis new policy is based on a rolling 12 month time period even though each calendar year employees are awarded 40 hours of sick time.  If you happen to take three one hour increments for doctors appointments, then say you are sick with the flu for three days, you will be given a verbal warning even though you have only used 27 hours of the 40 hours available to you.  Now, if this all happens towards the end of the year, since it is based on a rolling 12 months, and you get sick in January and you have to take sick time, you are on your way to being terminated even though the corportion just gave you 40 hours to use for the new year. \r\nDue to the massive amount of turnover and manipulation of benefits, I would not recommend this as a company to work for in Phoenix."}, {"review_title": "Houston we have a problem.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Technician", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Overall not a bad company to work for.

Therefore everyone in these positions is usually miserable, which doesn't help the situation.  Program Managers are overworked beyond any and all reasonable expectations, so customer service suffers...constantly.  Most of the job of any middle management employee revolves around convincing an irate customer to stay rather than gaining new business.

There is a general negativity around the office, generated by the laziest employees constantly fighting and bickering and complaining about how their job is harder than everyone else's and how they are most invaluable. It's quite bizarre and juvenile and pathetic.  Employees who know which fellow employees work hardest and have the most responsibilities will treat them with aloofness and resentment. Fellow employees often conspire against others to land them in trouble or to get them punished, over some kind of envy or a petty squabble or whatever else. Incompetent employees rarely get disciplined by management, and overall there is almost an incentive to underperform because there is no benefit to exceeding expectations and excelling at what you do.  It's painfully obvious that doing the very barest minimum while a small handful of people pick up your slack will not get you fired, or even in trouble. It's so weird that it almost seems as if WM has a masochistic desire to push their best employees AWAY from the company by kicking them around constantly and using and abusing them until they have burned out while coddling relatively worthless other employees indefinitely.\r\n\r\nManagement, while polite and generally kind, will just demand more and more of you if you can handle everything they throw at you and you'll get nothing in return.\r\n\r\nUpward mobility feels hopeless and unobtainable once you have become irreplaceable in your current role and the only thing that can breed is discontentment and apathy. \r\n\r\nFrom the top down, WM does a very good job of making sure all the middling employees on the frontlines of making this company efficient have no value and are absolutely replaceable.

Even with 20 years of sales and customer service experience, there was a severe lack of training offered.  I was kept afloat by my team members in the district, luckily I'm a pretty quick study.  As others have mentioned, communication is nonexistant - whether it's from the top down or just between departments.  This always leads to animosity that is unnecessary.  I agree that employees are often treated like children, if you thought enough of us to hire, perhaps you should allow us some empowerment and trust in our integrity, micro-management never works and just brings out the worst in people.\r\n\r\nThis company likes to roll out multiple initiatives at one time - this is common at large organizations with an extensive senior leadership staff - everyone has they're pet project that they expect to advance themselves with.  The problem is the field personnel and other minions can't possibly keep up with it all and soon the initiative is dropped due to lack of interest, whether at the corporate or local level.  I was told when I was hired by employees from ALL areas of the company that our mantra was: \"the only thing that stays the same is change.\"  That's fine, I can roll with the flow, but truly it can become laughable after a point.\r\n\r\nAs previously reported there is a great deal of nepotism/favoritism at this company, it is very much an old boy network mentality. As I have no wish to advance here, I suppose this poses no real problem for me.\r\n\r\nMy biggest complaints are two-fold:\r\n1 - There is a real problem here - it's called paranoia, this organization has a serious culture of fear.  Whether your a driver, a customer service/call center rep, corporate employee or in sales, your always reminded that those who don't meet their goals will not retain their employment.  I'm not against this normally, I believe everyone should work hard and give 100% every day, but please don't hold it over our heads like a sword that we can be replaced.  We know we can, especially in our current economy.\r\n\r\n2 - Our customers should be treated with respect.  This means offering competitive pricing within the market, exceptional customer service and common courtesy.  This does not mean nickel and dime-ing them with ridiculous extra fees and surcharges and expecting your sales team to try and sell the value of them, stop trying to show \"growth\" to wall street at the expense of your customer.
