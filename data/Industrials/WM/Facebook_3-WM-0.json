If you don't fort in with your politics they blackball you and you're never allowed to even mention the word union without the threat of being fired. Management try to pretend to have a family feel but it's all smoke and mirrors. Behind closed doors the truth comes out about the shady tactics used to manipulate workers. They come up with ways to make people quit by making their work life suck so they can say they didn't fire them, they manipulate employees to not file workman's comp claims, they have all kinds of schemes to use company resources for personal gain like funneling goods through corrupt venders or purchases of TV's and stuff that they say are broke but really go to their house. They use employees to work on their personal projects like welders building their personal trailers, mechanics working on their personal vehicles, having employees wash their personal vehicles and go to their house and cut their grass on the clock with the company mowers. Just all kinds of shady crap. They use the gas cards and green cards for personal expenses. The level of corruption is staggering. At my site they won't even hire the correct amount of managers because the few they have are in cahoots with each other and they're afraid an outside person would turn them in. They won't hire black people but then claim it's because they don't apply but behind closed doors they tell nonstop racist jokes and make racist comments. You can never get ahold of management either, they don't answer their phones, they're never in the office and when they are in the office it's because they have the mandatory meetings on the computer that last hours and they're unavailable during those times. Even when you do talk to them they hardly ever remember what you said so nothing gets done. They push the safety narrative a lot but in the same breath they tell everyone they're gonna be out of a job if they don't work faster. Even when employees are telling them that working faster is what leads them to make mistakes while driving and makes them unsafe. You're under constant video surveillance. There are cameras inside and outside of the trucks, they hire companies to follow you around doing video surveillance, and the managers follow you around hiding taking secret video. It's all very draconian. Things that they aren't legally allowed to make you do are volun-told. They say they need you to volunteer but if someone ask if they have to they tell you that you don't actually have a choice not to volunteer, hence volun-told."}, {"review_title": "Driver", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Truck Driver", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay was good for the job", "cons": "The hour's can get to be long"}, {"review_title": "I wish I could give this company no star", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Equipment Operator in Gansevoort, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you are desperate for a job you will be hired.

You can make some decent money selling for WM. Also, their training methods for new reps learning about the industry were solid. By the time I was ready to go out on my own, I was very confident, which made it easier to rack up those elusive cold-call-closes. Being based in a smaller market, the large accounts were sparse (or had already been sold by the more tenured reps), so I had to target smaller accounts that didn\u2019t bring in large dollar amounts. That made it hard to close enough to hit monthly goals, especially once the pandemic hit.

We all thought our jobs were secure, and the company had made a point to reiterate that starting in March 2020. We were well taken care of until until we suddenly weren\u2019t. We were given severance packages, which was nice, but it didn\u2019t really help with the hurt of being cut loose without warning by a company for which we were all proud to work. \r\nAnother con - hitting salesforce metrics every month. A HUGE emphasis was placed on this. Of course, it was theoretically done to help reps build their pipelines and succeed, but it never felt that way. It seemed like more of a \u201ceveryone make sure to hit your salesforce numbers so corporate won\u2019t be mad at us\u201d type of situation.
