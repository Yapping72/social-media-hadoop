THIS PLACE IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF A FAMILY BASED ON THE LOW INCOME HERE.", "cons": "\u201cCommission structure is ridiculous in regards to the pay out and how much we make them. The base salary that they promise you is NOT CORRECT SO ASK MANY MANY MANY questions about what it is WITHOUT commissions. They will try to push that with the commission you will make a certain amount which by the time you follow Alice into the rabbit hole you are in to deep and that there is very little grass on the other side of the fence. Literally I had paychecks that made me feel like i worked at MCDONALD'S and wondered how i was gonna pay my bills. Sales reps are constantly opening accounts that are not suited for a service agreement they just use the SSR in their pawn to make there money by haggling the customer on pricing to win the business. If priced to low you will be nothing more than a glorified delivery girl or boy, and very rarely are the accounts sold at the top tier pricing which nets you the most commission . Also I had to close numerous accounts due to the customer not paying their bills due to the way the Sales Rep set the account up with inaccurate payment information or the person in charge of that company to pay the bills. Also had to close other account because the customer never wanted or needed service. There were times I actually called random peoples houses because the Sales Rep just put a random contact number in the system just to open the account on the premise they'll fix it later, never happened. They were never held accountable for any mishaps everything was a dumping ground to the SSR. Sad part is Management is suppose to approve or disapprove every account being opened, however when the mentality of management is that they will protect their monthly and yearly bonus BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY its a breeding ground for an US vs THEM face off which is sadly the current state of this First Aid and Safety division. Management here DOES NOT CARE ABOUT employees as they say. Even corporate upper management hires managers from the outside and the whole time i was there NO ONE was ever promoted from SSR up into Management. They say they like to promote from within but that is very false and untrue. However they will dangle that carrot in front of you to make you work harder and never give it to you. If you ever wondered how a PACK MULE felt then APPLY HERE. Everyone is just a number that can be replaced. Voicing your view is looked down on if its not that of management even though they preach the company stands on integrity and honor but yet dosen't value that opinion of those like the SSR on the front line. Be prepared for the most UNDERHANDED and DISCOURAGING business practices to be on full display here. The most important thing anyone gets from a job is a paycheck to provide and take care of their family and once that line is crossed, blurred, or just plain out obliterated then all integrity and validity is out the room. The goals they have you work so hard to chase every month can be gone in a instant of achieving said goal because management will issue credits for those accounts that have not paid their bills months ago and WILL TAKE THE COMMISSION BACK FROM YOUR CURRENT PAYCHECK SOMETIMES WITHOUT WARNING OR A CLEAR EXPLANATION AS TO WHY and also THEY WILL TAKE AWAY from the amount of sales you worked so hard to achieve during the month and this is SADLY AND DISCOURAGINGLY DONE ON THE LAST DAY OF THE MONTH. So example if your goal is $20,000 and they credit $2,000 against that then you just LOST YOUR COMMISSION (Taken from next check) AND YOU MISSED YOUR KPI GOAL all in one click WITHOUT WARNING. THEY NEVER EVER KEPT US IN THE LOOP about credits they would send out a mass email stating certain accounts will be getting credited on the LAST DAY OF THE MONTH AND IT WAS 95% of the time between the hours of 3-5pm. Therefore there is no way you can go out and sell $2000 dollars to put you back in the clear. Then because you did not obtain a certain amount of KPI's they will have a performance review and ask why you are not hitting goals but seem to skip over the fact that your sales just got HIJACKED days prior. DO NOT ---DO NOT----- DO NOT trust Human Resources here who claims they have an open door policy more like an BIG OPEN MOUTH policy as they frequent lunch with management partners on a constant basis. I know you're thinking its a harmless business lunch until you find out that what was discussed by you in confidentiality was being told to that person and used against you. The famous phrase \"TRUST NO ONE\" fully describes the HR staff here. Many SSR's had to utilize the anonymous number to voice their opinion because of the BLATANT FRATERNIZING between HR and management. Sad to say I was actually warned about this my first week on the job. \r\n\r\nI AM NOT A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT I AM A COLLEGE EDUCATED INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS AN EXTENSIVE WORK HISTORY IN MANY INDUSTRIES IN ORDER TO VOUCH FOR GIVING THIS REVIEW I AM GIVING.

There was constant change from what was told at the onset of the position to what was expected. If you are a good liar and want to sell customers products they don't want and can be sneaky and fill their cabinets then you could make good money. If you are pushy and enjoy being overloaded with what you are expected to do  and know then you will enjoy this environment. \r\n\r\nYou are given ride along training and every SSR is different with how they train. They make it appear as an easy job start at 8:30 - 9 and finish 2:30 - 3:30 depending on the SSR. Well once they give you your van everything changes. You are expected to go through the van yourself and figure out what inventory you have. You are given a PRC and expected to follow what is scheduled for you without being able to provide your input in order to make your route more effective. You may or may not have the correct catalogues you need to know all of the products you are expected to sell and you are definitely not given any training on the products once again this is something you are expected to do your self. \r\n\r\nBasically it is figure it out yourself but don't expect to get any support from management as all they do is tell you you need to sell this and then they add more products, more customers and no input from yourself in order to make your route more efficient. You are to follow what is called a PRC device which has your customers and daily service route in it. These as well are very dated technology which crashes all of the time which then you are expected to go to a manual service - which you may or may not have been explained this.\r\n\r\nThey pay - start base $40K you then have the opportunity to go on bas $311/week + commission if you upsell the first aid (stuff customers don't need) and safety products. Most people stay on the base as the company makes it a challenge to earn enough to make the $311+ commission to live.\r\n\r\nIf you are desperate for a job then go ahead and apply if you enjoy sheer frustration and no support, if you enjoy the challenge of dated technology that you are expected to rely on then apply for a position with First Aid & safety.

In reality, many times trucks are only loaded at 70%-80% full though customer is charged full amount.  (My manager actually told us to make up statistics of how much we could save customers if they would sign a service agreement).\r\n\r\nMost managers are hired directly from military or college and it is evident they have little managerial experience.  if you have any manager experience elsewhere, they will not hire you.  They train all new managers \"Cintas' way\".  It is extremely frustrating because they just end up  repeating the same things that they read in trainings verses really thinking it through.  They tell you to run the route like your own business but micromanage to the smallest detail.  They ask  your feedback, but will use it against you as being negative if not what they want to hear\r\n\r\nExtremely high employee turnover rate really says it all.  If this was a good job, people would be sticking around!  An example:  In just over two years of my employment,  only 25% of SSR employees are still here.  Out of 4 service managers that were here when I started, only 1 is still here.\r\n\r\nThere are way too many sales contests, sometimes 4 going on all at the same time.  Compensation is low for these contests, too. Sales goals are unrealistic, and continue to get worse as you do better.\r\n\r\nToo many meetings (ex:  weekly debriefs, weekly team meetings, weekly sales quota debrief, monthly location meeting, sales contest meetings, quarterly safety meeting, and online trainings).\r\n\r\nEverything is one sided with Cintas:  They sign one sided service agreements with customers that will lock them into 5 years of service, then they will systematically increase the price at least 2 times a year. If you lose an account because management doubled price, it's your fault.  If you are unable to resign a new agreement with a customer before their agreement ends, it will go against you on your review and your monthly commission.\r\n\r\nCompany does not embrace new technology so there is incredible amount of paperwork that must be filled out, signed off on, reviewed, and ultimately entered into the system.  Also, safety is toted as number one but is really just lip-service as many times you may not have a cart to transport materials into customers, vehicle fleet is not properly maintained.\r\n\r\nLack of communication between departments which needs to poor experience to the customer, and frustration to employees as they many times have to do it all just to make sure it gets done.  \r\n\r\nNo paid holidays if you have 4 day work schedule."}, {"review_title": "Great Company - lack of focus", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 May 2013", "job_title": "Service Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strong, well respected company in the industry\r\nLeader in industry - our competitors follow\r\nWork with great people\r\nBuilding stronger relationship between sales and ops on a corp level", "cons": "No work/life balance - 5am until....(some people insist Saturday is the 6th work day)\r\nFlavor of the week mentality \r\nLack of support from above - figure it out\r\nPoor Fleet Management - shoestring budget"}, {"review_title": "Good and Bad", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "10 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Henderson, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I enjoyed the work I did.

During the interview process they make a lot of empty promises, such as getting you out of training early, or you'll make commission on everything you sell. They will also talk about bonuses that can get up to $30k quarterly (still haven't seen anyone get that). While you're an SRT the other rep that is sharing your territory is getting bonuses off of everything you sell. They are incentivized for your sales. They say this makes them help you, but what I have noticed is it makes them give you all the customers they don't want but still get paid for selling them. You have to go thru a mandatory 12 weeks of training where you will make little to no money at all. You will not be able to get on the auto package until you graduate training.

Your truck will break down and not occasionally. You will break down because this cheap ass company doesn't maintain anything on their fleet. Their main focus is to keep the appearance up & thats it. The routine oil change wasn't even done. This doesn't sound to bad...right? Sit on the clock & get paid... right? not then, they called you \"salesmen\" you didn't get paid any extra & most of the time they would tow a truck to you, at that point you would have to cross load everything then finish your route hours later. I believe Cintas has to pay overtime now after losing a large class action law suite for not paying employees properly. \r\n\r\n2. Your pay will change for many different reasons. One would be loss of an account. It may be your own fault but not usually. If a very large account goes belly up, defaults on payment or leaves for any reason a large part of your pay goes with it. After you feel the affects in your pay, Cintas tells you to sell more at other accounts. Remember you're a salesman! Another way would be Cintas frequently changed goals, incentives, bonus pay, or the overall pay plan and pretty much changed anything pay related anytime they pleased \r\nAt one point drivers that covered a far distance were paid more to cover the lack of earning ability due to distance. That was removed & fair was not part of the equation.\r\n\r\n3. Product: Never had a full days worth of it. Missing products from uniforms, towels, paper products, soaps, mats and most supplies the customer pays for. You were never to credit a customer for this. If you could lie your way out of it every time, that was good enough for Cintas! Most drivers had morals and made it up the next day but you were short product for those customers & cycle continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bottom line with Cintas is it's a corporation and the bottom line is most important. Not the customers or employees. They have things called \"spirit day\" and try to impose a \"family like videos\" that get rammed down your throat but it's smoke and mirrors. If you're not ripping off a customer with their sales promotions you better be an ass kisser! The benefits went from good to ok to go get your own.\r\n\r\nHere's what most drivers said Cintas stood for: Constantly In Need of Towels And Supplies. \r\n\r\nMost of our customers learned that saying the hard way."}, {"review_title": "Development", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Nov 2015", "job_title": " in Roxbury Township, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The best part about working here is upper management is constantly involved in developing people to make them better.

You are treated like a number despite how hard you work or how many years you have put into the place and how much you have done for the location and will be fired at any point.

You do not have anywhere near the amount of administrative support as the other divisions. your compensation is way lower than the other divisions. you are expected to track all of your own paperwork and billing (no other roll has to do that) and if you can't provide 100% documentation you do not receive your comission \r\n\r\nUnrealistic sales goals and implementation: they will try to tell you that an average deal sells for 5k... more like 1-2k. you are expected to hit sales goals that reflect the average job being 5k. Heres the kicker though, even if you sell all the necessary business, for you to get paid it has to be installed. This means you have to fit all those jobs on the schedule for that month. you also have to share the schedule/resources with another rep as well as the market managers \"recurring business\" It is also important to know that the market manager has full say of what goes on the schedule and when.\r\n\r\nOverworked/non existent technicians: Our branch had technicians quit left and right. if the techs can't work, they expect you to go out on the job and help to get the job done (unpaid). if the jobs don't install, you don't get paid and its still reflected in your goals.\r\n\r\nUsed as a stepping stone for people wanting in upper management: This division is used by the ambitious in order to get to the next levels of management. several people have had to be the head of that division in order to get to the next level of management and are now in upper management. They will squeeze you dry, and leave promises of being able to get you to a different division with no follow up action. I had a manager trying to tell me i needed to go on 25 new appointments a week, which is completely unrealistic. When i asked him if he truly thought this was realistic, he told me that I just wasn't working hard enough, even though this boss never had to sell this product in this division.\r\n\r\nComplete unawareness of the product and sales process from other divisions management: my favorite was when they said that \"FS and Uniform are a harder sale than deep clean is\", which is unbelievably false. Seeing as how Cintas is one of the few companies who can consistently fill orders of supplies without hiccups, the majority of people use them simply off this fact. With deep clean, you have local competitors everywhere who are willing to do it for 1/3 of the price without a major difference in end result (most of the time), you are automatically disqualified from many large job bids due to Cintas' \"non union\" status, and frankly even if you did win a big contract the resources deep clean has would in no way be able consistently meet the terms of the contract. \r\n\r\nIf your operations team is unable to complete the jobs management will still put you on a plan: If the schedule is full or you don't have the technicians to complete jobs, the management will still put you on a performance plan.\r\n\r\nask these questions while in an interview (but if you do they will probably cut you, Cintas doesn't really like \"Free thinkers\")\r\n\r\n1. what happened to the last rep here? what about the one before that? the one before that?\r\n\r\n2. what would you say the retention rate for the division as a whole has been?\r\n\r\n3. Can you direct me to some people who used to work in this division so I can ask further questions regarding their experience? (if they're still employees the may not tell you the truth directly, but their body language will say it all)\r\n\r\n4. what has the staffing been like for this position on the ops side?

The 2nd problem with Cintas is that they don\u2019t care about the employees. In their mind they can easily replace their SSRs. They also act like they treat us amazing and boast abouy their  16k salar they pay us. It\u2019s laughable. You make commission on top of that, most people are making under 40k bc they keep splitting people\u2019s routes. There used to be SSRs that would make 55k plus, heck some people made 65k-75k, but once you make good money they will split your route. I seriously know people who can barely pay their mortgage now bc of their route splits. Our turnover rate was 66% a year ago, it\u2019s probably even worse now. One average we lose at least one SSR a month.\r\n\r\nManagement acts like we are an ethical company but they secretly are pushing us to sell things to our customers they don\u2019t need.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but the internet is so much better for our customers.

The job i work for now has even better benefits.\r\n\r\nTraining - I added this in here because you have the ability to be cross-train in different positions. Your pay will stay the same, regardless that a specific role may pay more than another. My advice, make goals, get your experience, add it to your resume, and find another job who will pay you your worth. Cintas on your resume has some weight when looking for another job.", "cons": "Cons: Where do I begin\r\n\r\nIncentives - A free candy bar for exceeding your fellow partners expectation! They are enacting incentives at this facility due to the revolving door but even what they have in place is not enough with the competitive markets all around Groveport. No bonuses are given for performances for both associates and coordinators. This is not the place you want to be if you have work at other warehouses that values their employees.\r\n\r\nPay - Cintas has a spartan mentality, and they will not pay you to stay competitive in the market. The location I work, Cintas is in a highly competitive warehouse market and they will not find the right quality of people to sustain operations for long. We all signed on the dotted line, but all of us hired on was told about the vast opportunities the company offers to move up and assuming how large Cintas is, you feel there is hope. It\u2019s very slow. the first-year raises were highly disappointing thus began the revolving door.\r\n\r\nPay pt. 2 - Just because one location in your company pays less for similar job functions does not mean the cost of living is the same in this location. Each department has their own base pay, regardless of experience, you all start off at the same amount. If you don't want to pay more for your workers, just leave the area once your contract is up. You won\u2019t be miss.\r\n\r\nOpportunities - Slow, unless you are right out of high school, you may have the fortitude to wait several years at a chance for a good opportunity. Be wary though, applying internally does not mean anything, you will still wait months for a call back, if they even grant that. I know people who applied internally, and their resume was never viewed from HR.\r\n\r\nProrated time off \u2013 Good/ or bad. You are immediately allowed to use your time off as soon as you are hired vs some companies\u2019 standard of waiting 30-90 days. I have seen people hired in first day, see what the job entitles, then start calling off to use up there PTO, then quit.\r\n\r\nDisciplinary Action- Management claims that they aren't babysitters, and with that attitude, the actions of their 'partners' show. You have gossipers, and complainers who travel from each department who aren't happy, and with the amount of people in this location, the word spreads fast.\r\n\r\nDisciplinary Action pt.2 - The 'partners' who are the root cause of discomfort in the warehouse are not discipline enough for change. They have zero action plans thus the entire warehouse morale stays low. You will discover who they are first day easily for they will approach you to walk out the door cause it \"sucks here.\"\r\n\r\nHR - There is a comment about how disarray HR is, that is 100% true. There infrastructure is weak, causing mass confusion with their 'partners'. What you hear today and sign off on can change one day later (seriously). HR is very slow with processes and you will have constant anxiety on whether something was done correctly. \r\n\r\nTraining - While I made a positive comment about training, there is also a negative. The training can be limited due to the lack of experience with management. Since they do not want to babysit and don't have SOP's straighten out and finalize, you are forced to make mistakes, it\u2019s okay because no disciplinary actions are taken. One lady had been written up almost once a day, 4-5 times a week by Quality and nothing was done. She got her own self fired for doing something extraordinary out of context.\r\n\r\nQuality - Bad products coming in and out the door and quality is overwork and underpaid. There Inbound person after 1 year had enough, put in his notice and left. The customer complaints will roll in because production management thinks they know more about quality due to their experiences on the rental side of the business. Quality management is non-existent from what I seen in the warehouse, they just had quality associates.\r\n\r\nManagement - Management lacks the experience to handle their team. There \"were not babysitter\" attitudes makes for an uncomfortable/hostile environment. With HR not taking a unbiased/anonymous approach, you will be left speaking in uncomfortable positions, sometimes with the management person in the room. The walls in the rooms are paper-thin so when gossipers see you go in the office, they will pretend to go in looking for something, then spread the word of what you said.\r\n\r\nCulture - The CEO would have a full investigation team out in this location for how badly the locations culture is. No PR speech can cover up the mass destruction that is taken place within the infrastructure of this company. Wasting money on throwing up quotes and timelines on the wall and management not showing that they live and breathe these core values to there 'partners' is the reason why this location, and plenty more are tanking."}, {"review_title": "Un-noteworthy", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The company is comprised of several lines of business.
