Field partners are rude and lack coth or professional etiquette and nothing is said to them because the turnover rate is so high. Managers treat you more like their kids, instead of a peer and have serious power struggles, with pulling rank i.e. turn your camera on during meetings even internal, no wfh or flexibility and clocking when you get in or leave, despite all corporate office positions being salaried. Pay is also significantly low for the average for a role like this, which entails organizing their chaos and enduring abuse and overwork from corporate for stupid TODs, MAMS asking for menial tasks they can do theirselves and disrespectful field partners."}, {"review_title": "It's a hit or a miss", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "26 Feb 2023", "job_title": "SSR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "4 day work weeks.

A lot of adding products to invoices under the discretion of free one week and banking on customer forgetting was on invoice for future charges. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Many more examples exist. I'd suggest all customers review all products and services on invoice are being serviced correctly. Some locations follow all cooperate rules but like any company there are individual locations that are shady. One phrase I hated was \"you didn't just hear this from me, but\" and then tells you do do shady things.

They do not want to hire someone who has more than a few years of experience. I have had really quality candidates get dismissed because they have 10-15 years of experience. Beside the age discrimination, Cintas offers a $40-43k base which is laughably low in certain areas of the nation. Sure there are commissions, but your base needs to be able to cover your cost of living and for the majority of independent people looking for work this is a minimum of $10,000 below requirement.

They make candidates jump through these hoops, for what? To be fired after 6-12 months when they aren\u2019t a president club rep?
