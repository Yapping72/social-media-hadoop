Management failed their employees in so many ways from support to gossiping about other employees it was just pathetic they couldn\u2019t even do what they were supposed to.

Any hours over 40 are only 6.5 not time and a half it\u2019s in there pay plan make sure you read. If you think HR will help you with these issues think again HR only cares about your vaccinations status. Rules are constantly changing and you are expected to know and keep up with them even if your management dose not inform you. Be prepared to have to explain to customers on a regular basis why you are out of items and they are still being charged for them and that this is all in their agreement that they will be held to. Overall this company will sell you a big picture of a four day work week, great weekly pay, and team work non of this exist here.

It was like having to fight fires, all day every day on their behalf. Customers will hate you after they realize how you locked them into a contract for 5 years and the verbiage you used was \u201cservice agreement\u201d. You told them they could complain and get out but the service team is telling them, \u201cNope, it\u2019s a contract for 5 years, pay the remaining weeks or we\u2019ll take you to court.

The work is not hard if you love sales, but their expectations are a little ridiculous. If you don\u2019t bring in their undefined weekly sales expectation, they\u2019re quick to put reps on PIPs.  On top of those visits and appointments, you also have to go load up stuff that your service team forgot, uniforms they left behind, or other items they needed. Oh and if you\u2019re unable to help them out, too bad, the customer will still get charged and they hope they don\u2019t notice.\n\nReps are sold on the idea of making 6 figures quick, which can be achieved but there are a lot of uncontrollable aspects to get there like: lack of inventory, location and competition. They claim to be better but in reality they\u2019re the same thing. You can\u2019t possibly expect the same production from someone who is in a big city with more opportunities than someone in a rural area where there isn\u2019t a huge need.\n\nI don\u2019t regret working here because it taught me to persevere against so many different things but I would never return to that industry.

Then I was told to ask my manager who then had to ask the senior team members for help anyways! The second manger was very knowledgeable, but would micromanage us like crazy and didn\u2019t care about the team and was very selfish. We all quickly learned he only cared about himself and looking good to our director. Thousands of employees were laid off in April. They decided to keep someone brand new on the team! And instead got rid of three fully trained employees. Makes no sense at all! Then they said if you saw the position posted you could apply again. Not sure why they didn\u2019t just furlough vs lay off employees. Definitely disappointed in cintas and how they handled the pandemic. They pay your car insurance which means they control your every move! If you get any sort of a ticket it\u2019s a write up. They want you to always park your car in reverse when in a parking spot. They don\u2019t even allow you to go on your own car insurance if you want to. Overall, this was a very stressful job. And who likes working for a company that doesn\u2019t care about their employees and only the bottom line.
