Needless to say, none of the customers get a 100% of what they are paying for their weekly service. However, when customers realized that they are short with their bar towels or aprons and etc, Cintas will be more than happy to increase the quantity and charge them with more money. Can sales reps make money?  Absolutely. Good reps can make somewhere between $90-$120k a year. Average rep about $70-85k a year. HOWEVER, can they sleep at night for knowing they cheated their customers on daily basis???  \r\nAnother thing, the management people. They are very micromanage.

Come to find out, it takes 2 years to  receive any matching contributions or profit sharing in your  401K.  Something had I known, or had been clearly documented some where, I would've never taken the job.  Lastly, if you leave the company they will not cash out your PTO time, so burn it.

The payscale at Cintas for support staff is abysmal. I work in accounting and we have a revolving door of accountants who come here out of college, make next to nothing, but work for two years to get experience and then leave for greener pastures. When questioned about the turnover issue, the CFO Bill Gale said in front of all of accounting/finance that he wouldn't raise the payscale as long as there was a never ending line of people willing to take the lower pay. As you can imagine, this hurt morale and made those of us who have stuck around feel like suckers for taking lower pay. Since that speech six months ago, the turnover rate has doubled within our department. \r\n\r\nThe second issue is the culture. The culture is oppressive. You are not an individual, you are a drone. You will not have your own thoughts and feeling, Cintas owns everything about you, and if you step out of line, you will be punished. I have had several higher ups scream at me in front of my staff because I dared to have an independent thought. Here are just a few examples of the mind numbing conformity that is required to function at Cintas. \r\nEveryone is required by policy to back into their parking spaces, because having some cars backed in and some in head first looks messy. \r\nYou are not allowed to have any food at your desk, because to them you are a little child who will inevitably spill something.  \r\nYou must not openly question policy, or the executive staff\r\nShoes must be polished at all times...I seriously had a supervisor yell at me in front of a whole room full of people because my shoes had a scuff. \r\nAlso, you had better be prepared to work 60-70 hour weeks, forever...because as they say \"That is the Cintas Way\""}, {"review_title": "Rewarding but challenging", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Mar 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High risk, high reward.

You will learn decent business acumen and how to identify/engage decision-makers. Finally, you can take advantage of an uncapped commission structure to earn great commissions - note that this doesn't scale with advancement. You will be given the opportunity to learn more logistically-oriented responsibilities, which will give you some versatility when figuring out an internal career-path. It is easy to move between the sales/ops sides once you've had some success in either. As an average sales rep you can expect a starting salary around $35-$50K and total comp in the $85K range.

Stock-price is everything, and you will notice that there is a top-down mentality that essentially conveys a 'do your job and shut your mouth' attitude. Most of management are drawn from the sales-force, which isn't always a good plan because sales people are individualistic by nature an not necessarily suited to teaching/guiding others. You will not find many MBA's in the company, and very few Ivy-leaguers despite compensation in line with 'smarter' companies. This 'brain-drain' creates an environment that can seem oppressive to intellectuals. There is definitely a blue-collar mentality, and even as a sales rep you will be asked to perform 'service' related functions from time to time. I don't think that's a bad thing however.

You\u2019re literally not solving any problems of importance here\n- they make you take a ton of online courses every month about common sense things like workplace violence, sexual harassment and more. It\u2019s not the fact that the subjects are unimportant but a sexual harassment course doesn\u2019t need to be 80 slides with no option to skip. All you need is one slide that says \u201cdon\u2019t sexually harass your coworkers\u201d ?\n- safety training is ridiculous. I don\u2019t need to take a 2 hour class on how to exit or enter my car\n- if you have any entrepreneurial tendencies you will hate this job\n- have to spend 8 hours per week sitting in a cubicle making calls. It\u2019s about as loud as a football stadium In there\n- forget any flexibility or work life balance if you want to earn a decent living.\n- they push reps to sell certain products and when they succeed then that product end up being on Back order for months so the rep can\u2019t make the commission on it\n- sales process is a joke. If you sell a soap dispenser for example you have to order like 5 different parts with item numbers manually on a little sheet, even after you already typed all the info onto your computer when they signed the contract. Might not sound like much but when you sell 20+ products to one client it can take hours just doing paper work for one client. \n- company only puts focus on quick growth which makes all other areas suffer. The technology provided to the sales team is pre-historic. Walking into the AR department is like taking a trip back to 1995\n- you\u2019re just a minion"}, {"review_title": "Treated drivers horrible", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Jul 2019", "job_title": "SSR in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Provide service to good people", "cons": "Long days\r\nBeing responsible for shortages to customers that i had zero control of."}, {"review_title": "Longevity job security", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "27 Jan 2020", "job_title": "Major Account Manager in Fremont, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Spent 25 years in sales made Presidents club 15 times it was set out to pasture at my 20th year reduction in salary realignment in sales", "cons": "Presidents club 15 times it was set out to pasture at my 20th year reduction in salary realignment in sales"}, {"review_title": "Good Experience, Wouldn\u2019t Do Again", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 May 2020", "job_title": "Outside Sales Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, good training, good compensation, great resources, awesome team", "cons": "Typical corporate company, pure hunting role"}, {"review_title": "Great place to learn the basics", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Feb 2012", "job_title": "Regional Sales Manager in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- slightly above average compensation opportunity up-to your third year in outside sales\r\n- widely respected on your resume\r\n- culture based on working hard, then working harder\r\n- if you're relocatable, there are TONS of opportunities for advancement", "cons": "- no concept of work/life balance\r\n- apart from cash, don't expect many perks\r\n- technologically, they're in the stone age\r\n- thinking \"outside the box\" is not welcomed\r\n- you're expected to be at the office at 7am"}, {"review_title": "Company is 100% micromanaged", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Mar 2012", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative II in Tampa, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stability\r\nGreat Customers\r\nSafe environment\r\n4 day work week", "cons": "Management does not care about morale.\r\nManagement does not care about equality.\r\nManagement believes in retaliation. \r\nManagement believes that family is the most important, when it is there own.\r\nManagement does not realize the normal stressors of a daily route. \r\nToo many \"short man\" syndromes roaming around.\r\nYou get away with with a \"nonprofessional\" if you are of non caucasian decent."}, {"review_title": "Typical big corporation.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits, profit sharing, and stock options.

One could work years with no raise and are told, \"if you want to make more, then sell more\".  Location spends very little on rewarding SSR's for hitting goals or SSR of the month.  No equal equity for partners in sharing location profits and management is always crying broke.  You are encouraged to keep your opinions and thoughts to yourself.  If you do say anything, then you're isolated and counseled for having a bad attitude or corrupting others around you.  In reality though, most of the other SSR's hold similar thoughts but are either afraid to say something or have been given the same isolation tactic by management, so they just stop voicing their thoughts.  Management is reactive verses proactive to customer issues.  Product and rental pricing is all over the board for the customer and most times the small customer is hit the hardest with outrageous pricing.  The SSR is expected to not only add on products during the contract period, but also resign the customer or it could be held against the SSR in hitting monthly bonus.  Much of Cintas's lost business could be resolved by fair pricing and not increasing prices for the customer 2 or more times a year throughout their agreement.  Cintas attempts so many gimmicks and programs to entice the partners in ways to increase sales, but the rewards don't justify the extra time and effort needed to make them work.   It's called, \"kool-aid of the month\". HR is totally company biased in it's thinking and quick to note any negative issue in one's file.  The company is all numbers based and partners are second, when in fact, it's the partners that make the company survive.  Partners are usually steered like cattle in whatever direction Cintas deems is the right path, even if it doesn't work.  After awhile, we're steered another way because the previous direction didn't work.  (Cintas rarely admits mistakes or program failures)  The plant is literally run like a sweat shop. Sick time is available but if you don't use it, you lose it.  Why not pay an incentive to partners who don't use all or a portion of their sick time.  Maybe they wouldn't try to use it all up during the year.

There isn't a lot of support for managers on the HR side of things in getting new hires going or anything so you have to set it all up yourself. A new partner comes on and all the sudden your working 60-70 hours a week just to keep afloat. Your new partner won't get professional training until 6 months in so you have to train them until then, Cintas doesn't want to pay to send them to a conference if they aren't in it for awhile. Upper Management is out of touch, in my business specifically they raise projections 20-30% per year, no staff increases or anything they just expect you to \"get there\". I left Cintas for a higher paying position, put in my notice appropriately and worked a few days of it. My last day was terrible, they told me at 4pm as I was leaving for the day that today was my last day and I had to pack my things and leave, I didn't get to say goodbye to anyone and I worked there for almost 4 years. I later learned from a person at another location that my leaving at 4pm made my GM upset and that's when he decided to discontinue my 2 weeks, ridiculous that someone at another location would be privy to this much info. They sent my exit interview out the day I left and my previous boss TEXTED me to tell me that I should have been nicer on the review. Your benefits end the night you leave, even though you'll still be paying them in your last two weeks check they promise you they'll pay right away. Because I was on a car package that ends at midnight too so I had to try and find car insurance at 6pm when I got home just so I could drive the next day, not very easy. When I had a partner put in notice I ensured he was paid within 3 days of leaving Cintas but I had to email and call 5-6 times and eventually take it up to my Regional and HR Regional just to actually get my two weeks check paid to me and then had to fight over it being the correct amount to finally get paid. It took almost 3 weeks for me to get paid the actual amount I was owed. Lastly, I got COBRA for the month between my new job's insurance starting and it was over $200 more than what it initially said I would have to pay for it. If you're applying for a frontline role, go for it and it'll be great. If you're looking for a place to start a career or build a career and get some numbers under your belt, this is a good spot. If you're trying to build a career, work your way up the ladder, or have success in management be prepared to work 60-70 hrs in mid management, close to 90 in upper, and get ready to relocate on small dollars (they gave me $1k) to make that happen.

If you enjoy the maximum amount of pressure, bordering on unreasonable, you may enjoy this.", "cons": "I will organize this cons list into a few sections, and will do my best to remain as UN-biased as possible. \r\nEverything I will speak on is applicable only to the Market Development Representative position itself and is not indicative of any other sales position. Furthermore the operational aspects are only applicable to the CO Springs location in Colorado, and the region it is operating in. \r\n\r\nResponsibilities, Requirements and Expectations. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Position of Market Development Representative or MDR, has dramatically changed from when it was first conceived not so many years ago. In sharp contrast to the simple title of the Outside Sales Position (Facilities and Uniform Sales) which has seen minimal increases to the required number, the MDR position has seen sharp increases in it's quarterly and annual goals. \r\n\r\nPresident's Club Requirements\r\nYou are heavily encouraged to get to PC (President's Club) by the years end to be considered an exceptional rep, and PC nets you a nice little vacation along with some company stocks as well. The number is closely monitored and to ensure that only 5% of all reps nationwide are able to go and is increased sometimes yearly if more than this number attain it. (You are also not likely to be considered for a promotion unless you go to PC a few times as well.) The Goal is very high, and very lofty and raises every single year. You are expected to compete with markets in California and Nevada where prices are generally expected to be higher and opportunities are much more abundant. This is not measured, modified, handicapped or accounted for in anyway. A new requirement released this year requires 100 current customer account renewals which makes things even more difficult due to the terrible retention this region currently suffers from, I will discuss this in the Service Agreement Renewals and Operation Section. \r\n\r\nCommission and Pay Structure\r\nIn addition to the grind of hitting the PC number required (This year is 24,500 in 2020), you must also deal with the convoluted and confusing pay structure, along with aggressive monthly audits that are likewise confusing in there application, I will discuss them briefly below. In addition to this, the omission structure of the MDR changes yearly and is seemingly based upon whatever the company wants you to sell at that moment in time. Last Year we were given 5:1 Multipliers on everything Sold with the exception of Linen and Paper (Which is always 1:1), This year, corporate raised the Uniform Multiplier to 6:1, but dropped everything else down a notch to 4:1. I see this as a con because these adjustments are the lowest multipliers we have seen yet in sum total. In contrast the Outside Sales Positions have had there multipliers and incentives increased yearly, with the largest increase being to now have the capability to make money at a 9:1 ratio on selling Uniform Insurance. They stripped the MDR position the ability to sell Insurance at the same time without explanation.(It was later reintroduced at a 1:1 ratio requiring additionally a 60 month term agreement as mandatory to be paid) To sum all of this up, your multipliers are decreased significantly on any sale with a Service Agreement that is 48 months or fewer (4 years or fewer) in term and further reduced further down to 1:1 if the account is Nationally owned.\r\n\r\nMonthly Audits\r\nYour omissions are audited monthly under the pretense that the product you sold bills out for 4 weeks. If an Delivery Driver (SSR) has to credit the product for one week due to a shortage you will completely be denied the sale 4 months later. Other parts of the audit are completely unexplained, such as additional uniforms to current customer. If that same customer stops any other uniform on the account, not pertaining to your sell, but maybe an employee was let go and his uniforms were returned, you will be docked upwards of 60% of the total sell for a 'volume' decrease, that had nothing to do with the original \r\n\r\nBonus Potential\r\nThis is the hardest section of all to write for me personally, and most certainly the toughest to be unbiased on, so please bear with me as I attempt to list the facts despite my feelings about them.\r\nYou have the potential to bonus at the following ratios once per quarter,\r\n1:1 About what you will get payed if you exceed your quarterly goal. \r\n1:5:1\r\n2:1 \u2013 Middle Tier Payout\r\n4:1\r\n5:1 Highest payout Tier\r\nHere's the kicker though, you must account for only 'eligible volume' sold. You can sell upwards of 4500+ per quarter to achieve your summit club number, and totally fall flat of a bonus by having most of that volume disqualified. You will receive no credit for linen products and paper has a an annual hardliner that accounts for maybe 5% of your total allowable number. \r\n\r\nWorst yet, and this is probably the most corrupt, twisted and disgusting part of it all, is that if you work your butt-off for a large customer like say, a hospital and sell 2 quarters worth of volume all by yourself, your pay will be capped 40% for the year, and every bit of whatever else you sold will go to a Major Account Manager you've never even spoken to. MD's are encouraged to work with there Major Account Managers, and were told in the past that MA's will be there key to PC, this year however Md Rs have been capped at $2000 per MAM and most the Mams will never actually sell anything for you. Normally you'll sell the account, the MAM will flag the account as theirs automatically diminishing your omissions and take 60% of the pay and volume for themselves without even communicating with you. My associate who also shares my roll found out when his bonus tiers dropped from 5:1 down to 2:1 because a MAM he had never even met flagged the account as sold. This is incontestable as well\r\n\r\nFinally this company promises uncapped omissions, but will absolutely cap you at $5000 on any one account, and $2000 in bonus eligibility on any major account. You will literally make no money, and receive no credit towards any bonus or omission check. The one silver lining is that you will continue to receive volume credit towards P.C..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nService Agreement Renewals\r\nThe latest hat they've asked us to wear recently comes in the form a new stipulation to achieve PC, that being the requirement of attaining 100, 60-Month+ Service Renewals (or contracts with an out) in addition to the already lofty monetary goal. It makes sense that they would do this as many locations in our region alone (California, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada) were already suffering from a low retention rate even before the pandemic, which has only exacerbated the issue. In an announcement made by the SVP of service, Md Rs were asked to work with Service Managers in an aggressive campaign to attain a maximum amount of renewals in the shortest amount of time. The most Topsy turnover part of all of it is that MD's don't report or work for service, but were being required to take part in the campaign. The problem lies with that fact that most Md Rs aren't going to President's Club (5% always) thus this specific requirement doesn't apply to them but they are still pushed to be a part of renewing accounts regardless. I will cover this more in the next section. \r\n\r\nOPERATIONS\r\nThis section mostly pertain to my specific region (Mountain Group, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, California, New Mexico) and my specific location LOC 562, when noted. \r\nCurrently in the above listed region, the Mountain Region as it's deemed, we are suffering adversely from poor customer retention on the operations side, but doing very well on the sales side. The problem as myself, and most of my peers see it is that service is very poor for the high price that Cintas asks for. I can't tell you how many accounts I've visited in a week, located cities apart on different routes all have the same complaints. These are all throughout my territory of CO Springs, Pueblo, La Junta, Trinidad, Ramon, Buchanan Vista, Saliva and Canon City, and concern the distribution of products from Denver, Greeley and sometimes further to LOC562 on Co Springs. These are some of the objections to selling concerning bad service that I walk into on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nUniforms are consistently lost, delivered and sometimes don't show up at all, with little to no communication about a solution for weeks to months. \r\n\r\nService Managers rarely visit the accounts that have issues, most customers have no idea who there account manager is. Service managers do not answer there phones, and rarely answer emails. \r\n\r\nPrice increases aren't communicated, and sometimes there are multiple in a year. \r\n\r\nNew product launches are always mismanaged. Sales is encouraged to massively over-promote and push customers on a new product, but that new product is consistently in short supply or severely back ordered leading to massive credits and service issues. \r\n\r\nThese issues have gone on for years now. I state this to warn anyone interested in this position that once you sell a product, the service team will often fail to maintain that service via the avenues above. Since you are limited to almost exclusively inside sales, you will need to put our fires all over the the place to ensure you can continue to sell. The larger the customer, the larger the mismanagement in almost every case. There isn't a solution in site at the moment nor has there been in my tenure here. I've personally watched large customers just walk away with the only attempt made to save them being made as after both feet were out the door. Reactive and consistently not proactive seems to the module at Cintas. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, please please please read all of that one more time, and deeply consider a move to Cintas at this location, or in this region. I am currently looking for another job being at the end of my sanity rope here. I made nearly 100k my second year in this job but you couldn't pay me any amount of money to put up with the constant problems, political agenda and inefficiencies that Cintas Uniform Rental in Colorado Springs currently has, and consistently undermines your attempts to be successful."}, {"review_title": "Great opportunity as long as you don't need a personal life.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Jun 2010", "job_title": "Sales in Cincinnati, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Room for growth if you perform.

Those who try to take vacation will be asked to wait and also the work will have to be made up when they get back; you will have to work 16 hour days to complete everything after your vacation.

But that's only for people who get a good route. Plenty of SSRs in my location are right at the $35k mark.", "cons": "Be warned - lots of lies and smoke blown in your face. They post Sales Reps job openings, make you come in for 4-6 interviews, then tell you they need you to be on route as an SSR for 4 months as \"training\".  SSR BASE PAY IS ONLY $16,000/YEAR. They will tell you there is a $35,000 base but that is not a base, that is a guarantee - so if you fall below that they will bring you at least up to that. Sales reps get a $43k base plus car package which brings you to $48k, though they advertise $50k base and in my opinion a car package should not be included in base pay listings so it's a bit confusing.\r\n\r\nOnce you're hired as a sales rep and put on SSR route for \"4 months training\" you will find yourself 10+ months later still on route as an SSR with no end in sight on when you will actually be moved to the sales rep role. Starting around month four you will be told weekly by a manager how soon you're getting into the sales team, and how there are whispers around the office of moving you in there.  It gives you a false sense of hope until you fully realize it's all a lie and they are keeping you motivated to get as much out of you as they can and to keep you making money on route. I know for a fact they have hired four SSR's after me using the Sales Rep posting but convincing them to do SSR for a few short months.\r\n\r\nSo if you find yourself hired as a sales rep and put as an SSR for a few months of training, definitely don't turn your route into one of the top ones or grow it too much - you will never be moved into your position.\r\n\r\nAnother note:\r\nThe lack of women in any type of management position is also shocking. I had an issue with repetitive feminine infections due to the non-breathability of uniform pants and I specifically stated I didn't feel comfortable speaking to any male managers. I was told by HR that the process included having to speak to the managers at my location.

Otherwise, it won't always get done.  Your customers will be angry and want to cancel service which means your commission has to be paid back.\r\n\r\nTraining is focused 90% on call scripts (this job is cold-calling from a cubicle).  Very little training is on products or the pricing, so you have to figure that our yourself.\r\n\r\nThe #1 priority is Phone Block which means you are forced to make cold calls from a cubicle even if your customers are calling you with problems.  Management does not care, even though you are required to read a book titled, \"The Sprit is the difference\" where it lists Cintas principle objective is to, \"exceed customer expectations.\"  That is not true.  Phone block, and new business is their priority - PROFIT - not customer service.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, during Phone Block you are supposed to get 10 new appointments in that four hours - which no one can do.  Most people you call transfer you voicemail, or tell you the decision-maker is unavailable.  It's out of date tactics, and prospects get hammered all day long by other marketers selling: gas, electric, you name it.  You are assigned a mentor who will even tell you to, \"Inflate your numbers\" because no one meets the requirement.

It is even shorter for the drivers who get burned out by the workload, long hours, and low pay.  So your customers have constantly changing drivers who don't know their location, who is who, or what products they are supposed to get.\r\n\r\nThe software applications are cheap and extremely slow.  This means more time you must spend (outside of normal work hours) waiting on the slow system, and IT rarely can fix anything.  \r\n\r\nCintas pricing is significantly higher than the competition which makes taking customers from competitors extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nThe VPs arbitrarily raise the \"minimum\" to say $50.00/stop which means competitors who don't have that minimum can play that card against you.\r\n\r\nCustomers must sign a FIVE YEAR CONTRACT, which most people refuse to do.\r\n\r\nThe mentality is MORE, MORE, MORE and FASTER, FASTER, FASTER...

One of the best things I've seen during my many years with this company is that opportunities for career advancement are there for those that get results.

The pressure they place on local managers is enormous.  That is part of the gig and I get it.  My main complaint is their approach and the way they go about gettng what they want (exceeding sales, profit, and growth numbers, perfect inventory, perfect receivables, perfect execution on pretty much everything).  Absolutely no recognition of what is going good and what you may be doing well.  Every ounce of focus is put on what you are doing wrong.  If you beat sales, beat profit, have great AR, but your new product sales are down...look out.  You will be berated and forced to explain why you are unable to produce results in that one area.  The tone is condescending and threatening.  It breeds resentment.  You are micro managed to the 10th degree.\r\n\r\nWhat's worse is what upper management preaches about their fabled Corporate Culture.  Honesty, integrity, professionalism, treating employees like gold, and putting the customer first.  Such hypocrites, their perception of themselves is so skewed it's actually scary.  They preach it, but they certainly don't practice it.  Customers are taken advantage of.  Each rep walks into each customer for service knowing exactly how much money they need to get out of that customer in order to make their daily number.  There is no clearer example of Cintas first, customer second than that.  Clearly it's about what Cintas needs, not what the customer needs.  The customer is going to get as much product as the rep needs in order to make their number, it has nothing to do with what the customer actually needs.  Prices are ridiculous and price increases happen all the time with no advance notice to the customer base.\r\n\r\nI will say that it wasn't always this way.  Top management in the division has made it this way.  Leadership is a thing of the past for the most part.  Now it's all accomplishing micro managed task after micro managed task.
