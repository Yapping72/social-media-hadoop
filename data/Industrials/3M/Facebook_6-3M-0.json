Bonus % by rank is also low. - Too many old people who have worked for 15-30 years at the company at really high rank but with super old mindset. - Managers that does not know anything but have a very high rank due to tenure at the company. - Too many people who does not do what they are supposed to do, and somehow let off the hook whenever mistakes happen. Escalations are not taken seriously. - No team building/meal budget or any remote working compensation. - Office location super inconvenient if you need to go in to office. - No transparency in reward/job promotion. Not like other companies, you will not know what job grade/rank others are at because job title seems to be completely misleading and random for some jobs. This is probably to cover up the fact that a lot of long tenured folks are already at very high rank and not doing what they are supposed to do at that level. This is something that really needs to be looked into by HR I believe. You cannot improve your employees if there is no transparency as to how to move to the next level or progress. Good people will always leave while people who are looking to retire will stay and be stagnant. - Their motto is hire to retire - which explains my point above. I have never seen so many lazy people in one company, and they are all here. - Everything takes really slow to implement.

Excellent salary. 3M really stepped up during COVID by sending all employees a COVID care package which included cloth masks (10), anti-bacterial sanitizer, and a zero-touch door opening tool. Zero on-call responsibility. The offerings for people that were affected by the (still ongoing) reduction in force (RIF) were better than I have seen elsewhere. Everything from coaching, expert consultants, access to job fairs, etc. It was by far the most well executed and organized RIF - maybe this is a negative?", "cons": "I have never seen a company spend so much time, effort, and money on all the stuff they physically mail. All of the content was simply, \u201clook how awesome everything is at 3M; you are valued\u201d and had zero value other than to the people who were picked to pose in the articles. God help you if you want to make positive change. It is like the mob - they will whack you, your family, and your pets. You are good if you are okay with the \u201cthis is the way we\u2019ve always done it\u201d mentality. By far the most political environment in which I have ever worked. Everything is a favor and not \u201cjust do your job\u201d. 3M is way too big for an individual contributor to matter. Everyone starts out shiny, hopeful, and wanting to help out your fellow 3M\u2019rs but after a few months that all changes to frustration, anger, and despair. You are, quite literally, an employee number, an expense, and a line item on a spreadsheet. If you think you matter, I promise you that you do not. If you think you are part of a larger purpose or mission, I promise you that you are not. If you think your contributions have made a difference, I promise you that someone else took the credit for it instead of you (but you will never know). Management would let people go and you wouldn\u2019t find out until you attempted to reach out to them and never got a response. When you finally get fed up with the lack of response and reach out to their manager, you are finally told that they are no longer with the company. When asked who their replacement is for XYZ function you are told that there is no one and there will be no backfill because there is a constant hiring freeze. Huh? I had absolutely zero 3M-funded training during employment. Whenever management was asked about funds for XYZ training, employees were given the runaround and eventually would stop asking altogether. For the first time in my IT career, I paid for my own training, event fees, and certification costs. This is a standard benefit afforded to almost any IT professional by a company (unless you work at 3M). I saved this for last. If you feel that this is inaccurate, please read some news articles before considering employment. Google \u201c13-million-3m-earplug-verdict\u201d to get a nicely summarized summary. Shady business practices and tactics. 3M touted itself as a company \u201cbased on ethics\u201d - I am sure that ethics exist somewhere at 3M but I don\u2019t consider screwing veterans and other responders out of settlement money by splitting a company into two, where one is profitable (new healthcare company) and the other not so profitable (PostIt notes, Meguiars, Nexcare, and everything else) with the intent to bankrupt the legacy 3M hoping to subvert paying what is rightfully owed. Additionally, I don\u2019t think it was very ethical to invoke a huge reduction in force (which is still on-going) just a day or two after the judge called BS on that plan. After the reduction in force was enacted, and then applying for jobs, I quickly realized that my time at 3M had actually crippled my career because everything was so massively siloed that you didn\u2019t have the ability to grow much less get anything done effectively or in a timely manner; but you stayed because the pay is awesome and benefits were great. You lose a bit of your soul in exchange for benefits, pay, and flexibility; believe me, it isn\u2019t worth it to put the 3M name on your resume. The severance pay was definitely not commensurate with the tenure, effort, contributions, blood, sweat, and tears spent. I am sure this review will be buried by an over-abundance of false \u201ceverything is great\u201d and \u201cMike Roman cares and his employees love him\u201d type propaganda but I hope it helps just one potential candidate. 3M sickens me and I am ashamed that I was proud to work there.

I was hired as a software graduate but the company didn't seem to know how to turn a graduate into a software programmer. I had major impostor syndrome and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find a job anywhere else. I found my time there to be a truly spirit crushing experience. I worked on a variety of projects, many experimental. I had the experience of attending meetings with people who knew a project was due to be scrapped and would lie to you about it (to this day, I still don't understand why). Consequence was that I would continue to work on something pointless instead of re-directing my time elsewhere. Various cost-cutting measures introduced with false economies. I found that I suddenly had to do random administrative tasks that had previously been handled by a corporate team. My requests for help from that team were rebuffed (no performance appraisal benefit in them helping me). General technical incompetence. I witnessed a middle manager overseeing a team of well paid engineers ask why the data in a relational database couldn't all be stored in one table. Corporate IT asked me to share my password with them in order to fix something on my computer. An ideal environment for corporate psychopaths and self promoters. In my first week I attended a presentation by senior employees about career management. The advice was \"manage your manager\". This turned out to be true. People who spent time promoting themselves to their managers seemed to do a lot better than those who just kept their heads down, worked hard and delivered results. I saw a beautiful house of cards get built, the builder promote someone else into looking after it before taking the credit and moving on, leaving a live hand grenade behind.

Depending on what the current numbers were like the corporate strategy alternated between \"get rid of people to get costs down\" and \"boost R&D spending to increase the share of revenue coming from new products\".

It\u2019s a role where you\u2019re constantly painted as the bad guy to the healthcare workers you interact with and it\u2019s quite common your phone calls  immediately ruins their day (they will not be shy with letting you know this). Because the revenue you bring in isn\u2019t nearly as large as the legitimate med sales reps, management doesn\u2019t always care or attempt to recognize when you\u2019re performing well or overachieving. Other teams may be different but my current manager does nothing to invest in my future or growth as a sales rep. Ultimately I feel as though everyone in this position wants to leave it as soon as possible but management won\u2019t want to promote you if you\u2019re stable given the role is so undesirable and unfulfilling.\r\n\r\nMy advice to anyone considering this role is to be fully aware that it\u2019s primarily not a selling role, you will have to work every weekend/holiday, \u201cunplugging\u201d on vacation is almost impossible, and you will be stuck in the role for a minimum of two years before you\u2019re eligible to be promoted. You are unapologetically the bottom of the totem pole. Also keep in mind the turnover rate for the role is astronomical at the 2 year mark (you\u2019re basically gambling that you\u2019ll be promoted and then move companies if you\u2019re not)."}, {"review_title": "Great benefits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Machinist I in Royersford, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Offers a lot of different benefits.\r\nPay is a fair rate for the area.", "cons": "Pay is not based on merit so it does not encourage hard work."}, {"review_title": "Nice", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Buyer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice pay forward time effort", "cons": "Trying to get to other salaries"}], [{"review_title": "Nice", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Buyer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice pay forward time effort", "cons": "Trying to get to other salaries"}, {"review_title": "Good company, caring about its employees", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "26 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Senior Channel Marketing Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Company really cares about its employees", "cons": "Maybe not the highest salaries on the market"}, {"review_title": "3M - Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Jan 2022", "job_title": "IT Director in Cedar Park, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Global stage (if you want it)\r\nDiverse career options\r\nFlexible work location and hour policies\r\nSurrounded by a lot of great people and very smart people", "cons": "Job can be quite demanding\r\nGlobal time zones can be a bit of challenge to personal schedule\r\nNavigating a company this large can be challenging at times"}, {"review_title": "Good company that started to collapse", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Quality Process Specialist in Wroc\u0142aw", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It used to give great opportunities for development (incl. business trips, conferences, excellence communities) and was very open for any ideas for improvement proposed by employees.

They are very \"conservative\" in their approach so don't expect crazy high salaries and crazy new world perks(like unlimited PTO, drinking at work, constant parties) but I have found everything about my job and its benefits to be fair or better than average. The most surprising thing to me about 3M is how many employees have been there 20, 25, 30+ years and still love their job, I think that is a testament to how well 3M treats their people.", "cons": "I really cant think of very many cons.
