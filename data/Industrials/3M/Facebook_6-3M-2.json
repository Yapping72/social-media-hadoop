This was actually one of my main reasons for leaving the company, as I live across the country from where my family is and I did not get to see them as much as I had before because travel times were just too long to get back home within a 2-3 day weekend. I worked for 3M for over 2 years, and I would have had to wait another 2 just to get that 3rd week. I did get a month of sick days, but I was not allowed to use them for medical appointments, which in 2019 I happened to have a lot of.  So, I had to use my vacation time for these.

If you are thinking about  accepting a position at 3M and have a family or are considering starting a family in the next 5 years, I would strongly encourage you to discern whether or not you have the financial means to take an unpaid FMLA and/or use all of your vacation time for parenting leave. For maternity leave, you are eligible for 6 - 8 weeks (depending on the type of delivery) of short term disability and any additional time must be taken unpaid. The short term disability benefit varies by years of service, but for most people I know around the office who are expecting they will receive one week of full pay (provided they don't use any sick days in the last 12 months) and 60% pay for the 6-8 weeks. Any leave a new mother wants to take beyond that is unpaid. In the worst case, if a woman must go on bedrest before leave, her family stands to take a huge financial hit. For paternity leave, the official policy of 3m is that one day can be used for the day of the birth. If a father would like to take parenting leave, he can either use vacation or take FMLA unpaid. These policies are in stark contrast to what other local Fortune 500 companies offer (Target recently announced two weeks paid paternity leave and has updated their maternity leave benefits for 2016, Thomson Reuters has 12 weeks paid for maternity and 2 weeks for paternity, UnitedHealth Group also offers 12 weeks paid for maternity leave,  Best Buy offers 5 weeks paid for maternity). Additionally, only two weeks of paid vacation is offered to new employees in contrast to other competitors that offer three weeks (Boston Scientific, Target, TR, UnitedHealth Group). Lastly, despite a corporate initiative called \"Flex-Ability\", working from home is still a faux pax and you need to convince supervisors that it can be more productive and often essential to balance the needs of work and home. There is still a strong culture of \"butts in seats\". In an age where companies are acknowledging that employees are retained and more productive when they are able to balance their priorities at work and home, it seems short sighted that 3M likes to boast a competitive compensation package as well as a great company for women when its policies so clearly state the opposite."}, {"review_title": "Great company that has lacked inspirational leadership.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Oct 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "3M is a great company overall.

My particular manager seemed to never be there, so working flex hours was not an issue, but can't speak to other teams. The work load was not too extensive for me, but that may have been due to the in-fighting across teams that allowed very little to get assigned and done.  They had a decent web mail client, which, given managers' propensity to answer and send all emails after 8pm was a life saver.", "cons": "I would not know where to start here. Most employees have been there for 10-20+ years, so this particular division did not take kindly to outsiders. The in-fighting between teams was so extensive that I was given a list of people to \"not respond to via email or phone.\" I was also told not to attend meetings without approval from my manager to ensure my expertise was not \"stolen\" by \"the enemy.\" Yuck. I was closed off from projects I offered the most seasoned expertise in, due to senior leadership very much disliking each other. It was disappointing to not get to leverage my expertise in an arena that so badly needed it, and the constant back-stabbing and bad-mouthing of co-workers that started on day one and never stopped made me very uncomfortable. Also, I was constantly asked to tap my network of digital vendors, agencies and resources to produce RFPs or work for 3M at the 11th hour that never went anywhere. Great way to ruin long-standing working relationships outside of the company.  I was not aware of anyone who seemed \"happy\" working there compared to other companies I have worked for. No one smiled, ever. \r\n\r\nI finally had to start working on projects without telling my manager just to ensure I was doing anything at all and that I was helping them from spending way too much for way too little or just simply doing something not aligned with their audience/customer needs. \r\n\r\nFrom a sheer \"company\" perspective, the oddities at 3M Healthcare were endless. There were no refrigerators for employees to store lunch, beverages, etc. It may not sound like a big deal - try it sometime. The lunchroom was open very briefly every day, and offered the worst, most unhealthy and expensive selection of food (if you got there in time to get any) I have ever seen, anywhere. To avoid waste, they provided less food than needed, and anything edible was gone immediately. There's nothing but fast food around there, so going off-site was not a better option. I spent my first three days literally sitting in an empty cube with no computer (which can be typical) but also with nothing to read, ramp-up on, or anyone coming by to say hello or get me situated, manager included. I had to train myself on all systems and getting logins to do so was far more frustrating and time-consuming than usual. The commute is horrid, too, unless you live out that way. \r\n\r\nThere was no discernible process to anything, and trying to instill any was futile. I had to ask folks many times for things they'd promised to deliver, to little avail. I never really knew what I was supposed to be working on, what would come up as \"due\" at any time, or what would be summarily cancelled or taken off my plate - all of this was due to politics. I spent more time in meetings about projects that never moved forward (or that at least our team was \"kicked off of\") than in meetings about viable projects. \r\n\r\nI attempted to address all of these issues over and over, to no result, and ended up having to print and save the nasty emails between teams their managers to ensure I was never \"blamed\" for something I was not involved in. Not fun. \r\n\r\nIt might be fine for folks that have been there forever, and other divisions may be more advanced in their collaboration and politicking skills not to mention digital savvy. I didn't stay long enough to find out. I actually saw one person start and quit within a week while I was there.

They do not understand consumer driven businesses and do not adopt their business models and practices accordingly.  If you come from a consumer based company, you will be very disappointed.  Marketing budgets are consistently the first area to be cut and the company spends at approximately 1/3 of what other traditional CPG companies spend on marketing.   They very  much adopt the mindset of 'if you build a better mousetrap'.  \r\n\r\nThe company freely moves people in to roles where they have no experience or expertise.  While I can appreciate the willingness to allow people to move freely within the company, they assign people to roles based on tenure, not experience or expertise.   People with supply chain backgrounds run marketing, customer service backgrounds run sales departments and operations experts work in finance.  Without a doubt, the core of this company is built around technical (R&D) and operations.  They do not understand nor care about marketing, strategy or sales.   While the company claims to be focused on 'growth', all internal indications and behaviors clearly demonstrate they are focused on their historical nature of being a 'dividend' company. \r\n\r\nThe company as a whole is terrible at prioritizing: every project, tactic and strategy is a priority.  If you ask what is priority, the most common response will be 'all of them'.  This lack of decisions making is consistent up and down leadership levels throughout the company.  Very little, if any, decision making and prioritization is driven down in to the organization and employees are not empowered nor entrusted to make key decisions. \r\n\r\nBecause of the historical pension program, the motivation is low among more tenured employees.  Many are due to retire in the near future, with those that are near retirement uninterested in new ideas, business strategies or breakthrough innovation.  The overall goal is to get to retirement without any significant change.  Those with longer tenures do not value outside experience.  Their is an unspoken understanding that those with outside experience are known for having 'A3' and 'B3' experience (i.e A.D. and B.C.). \r\nOnly experience gained with 3M tends to be valued by other 3M'ers who have been with the company for most of their careers.  The overall culture focuses on  'checking the box' and 'falling in line with your boss'.   While titles appear to show a flat organization, make no mistake, decision making is very much hierarchical.
