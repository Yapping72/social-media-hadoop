I love seeing and hearing other colleagues' culture and even ways of how they tackle the same problem. \r\n\r\n3M is also a massive pool of knowledge - there are plenty of amazing experienced and knowledgeable colleagues that are willing to share their talent to help you grow too! \r\n\r\nThe 3M brand itself and the great-performing products helps us to do our job easier. It allows to focus more on customer problems rather than worrying if our product will perform to the customer's standards or not.\r\n\r\nLots of opportunities and 3M actually promotes you to try different roles to help you grow your career.", "cons": "Too many systems that are usually not connected to each other, creating more admin work. Too many job overlaps meaning there are usually 10 people that will want to do the same job, creating too much internal politics, slows the process down instead of accelerating things.\r\n\r\nDigital adaptation is extremely slow.\r\n\r\nToo much product training. I would prefer to focus your sales people on certifications as they can help the individuals in their career long-term, but inside or outside 3M. Once they have acquired these certification, accelerate their pay straight-away. You would then end up with staff that are compensated for acquiring more knowledge. Like Richard Branson once said, \"Train people well enough so they can leave. Treat them well enough so they don't want to.\"\r\n\r\nToo much internal chatter. I feel internal meetings' audiences should be limited to only the people that would benefit from the meeting. Big 250+ audiences I feel are unnecessary, spending over 20% per week in most cases on meetings alone, especially during the pandemic lockdown! My suggestion is to cascade the message through your managers, then ONLY IF NECESSARY, set up meetings with your team but with a 'narrowed-down' tone. If it can't be done in an email, don't take your staff's time on an hour's worth of meetings.\r\n\r\nIn my role in Sales, the Activity Metrics are just numbers and I feel the wrong metrics are measured (in most cases). Quantity is measured more than Quality therefore if not done carefully, it can have a negative impact on the staff as they will be driven in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nI also feel the the 3M Culture of leadership behaviours are great, but because the managers do not measure it, it becomes nothing but buzz words, especially 'Foster Collaboration and Teamwork'. The current Advance 3M model should promote interconnectivity globally to help us become much more productive and would ensure that our customers are assisted in the quickest, most efficient way possible.

It's hard to write this, but it's important to share.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view as a scientist and product developer, 3M seems to care more about its shareholders and its managers than it does about the people inventing and manufacturing the products that make our company relevant. This is a sad situation and I think 3M can do better. The first step is acknowledging some of its many serious missteps:\r\n\r\n3M cut jobs and salaries during the pandemic, but somehow had plenty of cash to pay out as dividends to rich investors on Wall Street. This makes very little sense from an organizational health perspective. And it makes even less sense from a social justice perspective where income inequality is such a strong forced for much of the negativity we see in the US right now. Furthermore, 3M promotes and rewards managers who lay off productive and valuable workers with no regard for the pandemic-rattled job market. Leadership would do better by 3M to adopt a Stakeholder Mindset.\r\n\r\n3M claims to be an inclusive company committed to sustainability and equality, but continues to reward career sharks who stifle truly sustainable innovation and the diverse people who drive that innovation. 3M cancels programs and stifles innovations that offer true sustainability (even ones with objectively excellent profitability) in favor of gratuitously high and unsustainable profit margins. 3M further rewards the same lock-step managers who feed this toxic culture, and stifles the careers of those who try to make a positive impact to our global society. As a scientist and global citizen, it is incredibly hard to see this happening at such an ostensibly progressive company like 3M.\r\n\r\nWhile 3M is truly excellent at charitable donations around the world, there are serious internal problems with diversity and inclusion. I applaud 3M's philanthropy, and hope to see improvements in culture internally. For example, while we do have quite a few underrepresented groups in leadership roles, many of these people have the same career shark mentality that prevents the people they're representing in their demographic from thriving and attaining similar success.\r\n\r\nNow, this message board ensures that \"each employer has the right to respond to a review left by a member for free, and that the employer be given the last word on a review.\" I enthusiastically invite a response to this thoughtful review - with the counterargument that our planet, 3M's employees and customers, and humanity's global society always have the last word. \r\n\r\n3M needs to do better. \r\n\r\nThe good news is that we can do better. We have many excellent people. We just need to have the right people in leadership roles.

The harder they work, and more success they have, the more money they should make.\u201d \r\n\r\nThis is NOT the premise the entire Inside Sales Dept. follows. If you are looking for the premise above, look elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf you are fine putting in a decent amount of hard work, keep your head down, have no drive to make 6 figures, and instead are cool with a annual 2% raise in your base salary to have a shot in 3 years of a 10-15% raise into a higher level ISR. Sign up for this \u201csales\u201d job...which really is a glorified order taker or account manager. It is a high base salary 65-75k account manager role. This is not a professional ISR role in whatever dept you end up in. The commission plans are inept.\r\n\r\nNo one \u201cmakes plan\u201d the commission plan changed 6 times in 12 months. Most of the time we were on guarantee as management had no clue what they were doing. \r\nIf you want to receive commission, and excel into higher yearly gross...That is NOT the path 3M takes. The Inside Sales department is valued by the company at large and is receiving lots of investment, BUT it doesn\u2019t translate into common sense. \r\nNo one exceeds plan, no one. That means the plan is BS. It is simply a salaried position and is an embarrassment for a Fortune 100 to state otherwise. \r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s what you get when you have a national inside sales director with no sales experience. See, 3M promotes only from within so they have the same silly po-dunk, middle of the road, conservative ideas that the C-level scientist leaders above then think are sensible. Not one ISR makes above 100k with commissions. Several make 90k as a base salary, but that\u2019s it...there\u2019s no commission happening, maybe 5k annually...is that a sales role? You tell me.\r\n\r\nLastly- if you\u2019re a woman or a minority-beware of the grade level they hire you in at...no matter how qualified you are for other roles in the company they have a strict HR rule that limits upward promotion. \r\n\r\nDumbest thing I saw was a co-worker, who had more qualifications than most of the competition, was not allowed to sit for interviews with hiring managers that were interested in her, because as a minority she was initially hired in at such an entry level ranking, (way below what she was worth on the open market to save money) and therefore, even though she exceeded the qualifications on the job listing and the managers wanted to interview her, she was denied the change to interview because it beyond 2 steps from her ranking.

In addition to that, the Springfield plant is no different than any other workplace, especially large factories - favoritism, discrimination, unfairness, backbiting, the good-ole-boy network, good workers are punished, slackers are rewarded, silly rules, rules that are just made up when convenient, wasted time and money, the blame game, and the common mismanagement pretty much sums it up. Compensation needs to be improved, about $5-$10hr more plus profit sharing, since the workers are dealing with deadly chemicals and therefore endangering themselves, their co-workers, and the community. Mandatory overtime can be a problem and you will be expected to work 19 12-hour days straight to meet \u201cbusiness needs.\u201d But they will give you 2 days off only to repeat the 19 days if necessary, because they care about you and your family, so they say.\r\n\r\nWith that said, after nearly 4 years of service I was terminated for not conforming to the political beliefs of 3M that were being forced upon the workers. For the last 5 months of my employment I put up with the new policies, the signs, the emails, and verbal communications regarding so-called \u201cCOVID-19\u201d and didn't dare question any of it, since questioning the Narrative is strictly forbidden. Despite the absurdities, the lies, the insults, the guilt-tripping, and all of us being treated like children, I remained quiet and said nothing. Even when some mystery dude came around spraying everything and everybody in the break room while we were trying to eat, I just fled the scene and allowed him to continue. As the mask ritual became the latest brainwashing campaign, 3M Springfield brought this charade into the plant and distributed masks for voluntary use, twice, which I simply ignored as did everyone else. At this point I became concerned because I knew the Plan was calling for mandatory participation, so my dignity line was drawn. Being forced to wear some dehumanizing mask that marks my acceptance of an immoral agenda and implies I am contaminated and that my co-workers are contaminated crosses that line, and I refuse to be disrespected and degraded by selfish, unloving people who simultaneously puff themselves up to be virtuous, be it 3M or anywhere else.\r\n\r\nAfter the mandatory mask announcement I requested a personal leave of absence with 3M Springfield HR due to religious objections to wearing a mask for this purpose. After supposedly discussing with \u201cthe team\u201d for over a week, the HR manager and whoever is on this team, as expected, did not approve the leave, did not offer an accommodation, and would not let me in the plant without a mask even though I was willing and able to work, so the official termination is blamed on absenteeism.\r\n\r\nMost people are aware that this mask agenda has nothing to do with health and safety, no matter how much the order-followers lie and chant their mantra, but rather compliance, conditioning, symbolism, ritual, and superstition. If anyone desires to work with 3M, or any other large corporation, be prepared to be treated like a dumb animal because the mask is only the beginning, so it may be best to just avoid the trap and not even give these seared-conscience people the satisfaction of forcing their inhumane beliefs upon you."}, {"review_title": "Good place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Senior Engineer in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice place to work for long term", "cons": "Low salary compared to similar companies"}, {"review_title": "Good company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Quality Engineer in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and bonus pay.

So if no one signs the board whoever has the lowest # of worked hours has to do it regardless of whatever plans you may have for when you get off work.

Although 3M does their best to keep a culture of innovation, they are a big manufacturing company and have lots of policies and procedures that promote caution, deliberation and avoiding mistakes at all costs.\r\n\r\n3M likes to rotate its managers into different business groups.  As a result upper management at Touch Systems changed every couple years.  Each new manager would need to be educated in the realities of the business.  Frequently the new manager would have a grand (and unrealistic) vision for the business that he would try to implement.  This led to many false starts.\r\n\r\n3M sets its salaries on the high end of average for similar large manufacturing companies.  This probably worked out well for chemists in the mid-west but electronics and software engineers in the Boston area received less than they would have at a local tech company"}, {"review_title": "Great company and great culture overall.

Long term career path if you work hard and build a network.", "cons": "This is specific to inside sales and the current management in place.  Management has never been in sales before. yet are in charge of sales.  Lack of understanding about sales process and how a sales cycle even works. It has changed from sales performance to metric based \"calls\" and \"correct contacts\" rather than the customer focused top line. Many employees are calling it their call center job because that's where the current  manager came from and runs it like that. Micromanagement and low morale haunts pieces of the personal safety division.  If you apply go for some area outside of inside sales and you'll be much happier. If you apply for a job outside of the area they will block you from moving on stating its \"a business necessity\" looking at not a personal career move but you are costing them money because they have to hire someone new."}, {"review_title": "You need to fit the culture", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Senior Supply Chain Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very diverse organization with many possibilites to develop yourself", "cons": "Lack of long term strategical thinking"}, {"review_title": "3M is a great company, they really care about the employee and make you feel good and important.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Solution Developer in Heredia", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-All the employee benefits.\r\n-Salaries are good.\r\n-The environment is really good.\r\n-Great opportunities of developing your career.", "cons": "Only good comments for this company."}, {"review_title": "A great company overall.
