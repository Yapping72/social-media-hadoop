They tell you the 22.4 combo driver position is an 8hr/day job split part working inside and part driving, depending on what's needed. Well, turns out \"what's needed\" is for you to drive 12 to 14 hours most days. Literally no 22.4 has done any inside split. We call ourselves \"discount drivers\" because we just do the same job for less pay. They also say it's a Tue-Sat job, but then force you in on Mondays, meaning you're working a 6 day week and your body has no time to recover. Absolutely no work life balance. Management doesn't care about you or your life they just expect you to use their 100 year old methods and refuse to acknowledge the world is changing. They don't care that they run you into the ground. They don't actually care about safety. They only care about safety for good PR or when they have to lecture you about something. People talk about the bennies begin great but it's not UPS being willing to give those, it's the Union fighting for it. The company wouldn't willingly give the bennies out if it wasn't for the Union, no way. They want to do things as cheaply as they possibly can to make the highest profit. In order to do this management does all sorts of shady stuff, like if you start as a seasonal and they want to keep you, they make sure your rehire date and seniority reflects in a way that messes with your ability to get vacation because that's that much more time they can wait to pay that out. Or they'll try to extend your probation period. Why? Because that's that much longer they don't have to pay your bennies. If they had it their way, we'd get paid way less with no bennies. If you're new/starting recently don't expect to live long enough to see that pension, or if you do, your body will be so destroyed you won't be able to enjoy it. Speaking of bennies, it really doesn't matter since it's impossible to get time off any way. Sure I've got great dental, but guess what, the dentist ain't open on Sunday, the only day we have off. Seriously, only work for UPS if you're desperate for the cash and don't have any other options.

So much that they have an internal UPS \"Super Pac\". They try to strong arm you into voting for candidates that are against unions and employee rights (meaning against YOUR best interests), while spinning it as actually in your best interest. Anyone with half a brain can see through this.\r\n\r\n-You will give to the United Way. Doesn't matter if you don't like them, already donated to something else, etc. It's not about helping others for UPS, it's about getting their name in the press and looking good.\r\n\r\n-The environment and mindset is stuck in the 1950s. No facial hair of any sort, day old stubble can get you into trouble. Seriously. Managers rule with an iron fist, employees are scum that will work and do exactly what they are told, no questions asked. And don't even try to suggest something for improvement, management doesn't value your opinion.\r\n\r\n-My manager, on more than one occasion, told me that she would have hired a woman instead of me had she been able to find one qualified. Yes, this really happened.\r\n\r\n-My manager consistently was passive aggressive about a week of vacation that I negotiated (as I had scheduled/paid for it 6 months prior) as part of my hiring deal. Every chance she had, she would point out that I hadn't even been here a year and had already had a week off, often in front of higher ups. \r\n\r\n-Seriously bad, way over the top micromanaging. I've never seen anything so bad in my 21 years of professional work experience. I literally had anxiety issues after a couple of months.\r\n\r\n-At one point I needed a webserver in our development environment so I could actually do the work I was assigned. I was told, in no uncertain terms, that installing a webserver in development (non-prod), was a fireable offensive. I was speechless.\r\n\r\n-Offices and office furniture that looked like they came from the 1970s. Much is open floor plan, which nobody likes.\r\n\r\n-Bad onboarding. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. I had my new hire orientation 5 months after being hired. I left for a new job about a week after.\r\n\r\nAfter 1 month I knew I needed to leave and find something normal, it was that bad."}, {"review_title": "UPS", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "7 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Compliance Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people (most), good money, stock, pension, 401k, opportuniy.", "cons": "Worked a lot of hours."}, {"review_title": "Very competitive but an amazing experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Part Time Package Handler", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good hours / paid weekly", "cons": "A lot of Exercise and heavy boxes caused a lot of back pain"}, {"review_title": "Loader", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Loader", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Has very good benefits for part time", "cons": "Over worked and stressful at time"}, {"review_title": "Dont do it!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Supervisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are no pros to list", "cons": "Toxic environment, unorganized, poor communication"}, {"review_title": "Overall good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Collections Specialist in Scranton, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary and benefits and pto", "cons": "Low employee morale at times"}, {"review_title": "Sort", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Local Package Sorter in Alpena, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Simple and easy work\r\nGood pay", "cons": "Not enough hours\r\nNot much room to grow"}, {"review_title": "UPS review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Driver in Tamworth, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good money, like friendly atmosphere", "cons": "The hours to work at weekend"}], [{"review_title": "Good pay and benefits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Driver/Helper in Jacksonville Beach, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "team work\r\npay\r\nbenefits and lots of exercise", "cons": "long hours especially during peak season"}, {"review_title": "Ups", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "20 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Warehouse in Columbus, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Weekly Pay, access to phone at work,", "cons": "The work is not worth the pay , cold building, supervisors are very rude."}, {"review_title": "UPS", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Package Dispatch Supervisor in DeKalb, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefit package available for employees", "cons": "Unorganized specific to current location"}, {"review_title": "Good benefits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Part Time Package Handler in La Mirada, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits.
