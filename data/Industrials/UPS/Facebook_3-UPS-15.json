The company invests a ton of money into the training (your benefits start pretty much immediately, you're paid well during training, 4-7 weeks of actual training depending on the flavor at the time). The Sales Academy is mostly a classroom setting, and the much of the training is highly applicable to sales in general (i.e. Situational Sales Negotiations, CRM technology, etc). This is a great place to grow your business acumen very quickly.\r\n\r\nThe health insurance is fantastic and the base pay is decent (see below for comments on commission). At the specialist level, you are paid weekly, which is nice. \r\n\r\nThink of this as a sales job with training wheels. If you're new to sales or the corporate environment, it's really hard to get fired due to lack of performance. If you ask for help, you will usually get help. \r\n\r\nRight now, there is a lot of room for advancement. It's probably not going to be in less than a year (like I was told), but after 1-2+ years there is room for advancement.\r\n\r\nDepending on the team you are put on (which is totally luck of the draw) there is great mentorship available. I have personally been able to develop my own leadership and public speaking skills because my coach has made it a point to find out how I want to develop as a professional. I am directly surrounded by strong leaders that give me the room and guidance for growth. SO MUCH of your experience at UPS has to do with your manager.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a lot of stability in UPS. It is an S & P 100 company that has been around for over 110 years and in a world where B2C commerce is expected to grow 50% by 2020, you can feel confident that UPS is going to continue to be solid for the foreseeable future.", "cons": "- Misleading on commission and PTO in the job offer\r\n- Difficult commission structure\r\n- Constantly moving target goals \r\n-  The environment feels like a call center\r\n- Stagnant corporate culture\r\n- That other person wasn't joking, you really do sit in a cubicle and get fat\r\n\r\nI was made a lot of promises that weren't completely true when offering me the job. I was told I would have the opportunity to be promoted within 3-6 months of starting the job, which was not even remotely accurate. I was also told there were two weeks of paid vacation in the first year, but vacation time is actually pro-rated after your 6-month probationary period.  Finally, I was told my target commission would be $12k - $15k per year, which is wildly inaccurate. This is a good opportunity, but it's not everything they promise it will be. This is my biggest issue with UPS - I feel it is at best unethical and at worst potentially illegal to be so misleading in a job offer. \r\n\r\nDon't let HR fool you into thinking they are hiring because there is so much promotion. There is high turnover for many reasons:  culture, feeling underappreciated, higher paying equivalent positions elsewhere).\r\n\r\nThe commission pay structure changes every year making it difficult to understand and achieve. As I write this I know that my SIP (commission) will change in January, so the next sentence may not even be true in a month. The commission is currently based off of the performance of your territory compared to last year. This structure means that you have to reel in a whale to affect your pay.  Additionally, commission is only paid out quarterly. \r\n\r\nThe environment can be very high-stress. There are high expectations and the target is constantly moving, making it difficult to achieve. \r\n\r\n***Management gets commission based on your performance and management gets a $$$ bonus when you are promoted within business development***. Because of this, management is very resistant to people entering into other divisions (such as operations or finance).\r\n\r\n The culture in Inside Sales is beyond out-dated. From the dress code to the way people interact, a lot of policies would be better suited at a sock hop than a modern place of business. \r\n\r\nFinally: this is corporate America. There is a hierarchy. Sometimes your boss yells at you simply because they got yelled at. A lot of initiatives don't make sense. A lot of things, in general, don't make sense. You are 1 out of 450,000 employees.  Being mediocre and doing things their way is the key to success. \r\n\r\nOverall, this is a decent job, especially for new graduates. I would not suggest staying in this position long-term, but I personally feel that I have learned a lot.  UPS is a solid company and there is room for growth.

This puts most of us well over $90k per year and many a bit above $100k. But you will earn every penny - we are actively working 100% of the day. This is a stark contrast to most professions where employers expect to get about 40-60% of productive time out of their workers in a given shift, 75% from an outstanding employee. There is no downtime - no internet surfing or chatting with co-workers. In addition to the pay, you receive free benefits - health, dental, vision. All paid for by the company with no payroll deductions. There's a 401k and full pension in retirement. There's also a discounted class A stock program - preferred stock that's unavailable to the general public. That stock program has made multi-millionaires out of many an old-timer. We receive between 2-6 weeks paid vacation depending on years of service, in addition to the 5 personal days and 5 sick days that everyone gets regardless of seniority. That means that many of us end up with 8 paid weeks off yearly. We are afforded union protection that makes it nearly impossible to be fired unless you break one of the cardinal rules - theft or dishonesty. If you're doing your job well and/or consistently doing your best you can go weeks with little to no contact with management outside the dispatcher. You're working for the industry leader in a growing field with management and union brothers who have tremendous pride in the company and service we provide. You're treated as extended family by many of your customers and will develop many lasting relationships that transcend the job. As such, many drivers do very well with tips around the holidays, adding tax-free income to an already lucrative endeavor. The job security is nearly unmatched - UPS is one of the oldest continuously operating companies in the US with 100+ years of service. Being on the Fortune 100 list and consistently named one of the best companies to work is just par for the course for UPS.", "cons": "The stress level in this job is fairly high, and much of it is unavoidable. Outstanding performance is both expected and demanded. Everyday. Without exception. The physical demands of the job are extremely strenuous as well. The work/life balance leaves something to be desired - you can expect to work from 8 or 9am to around 8pm every single day. There's no leaving early because you're not feeling well or having a rough day - you are out until you finish with VERY few exceptions. Which means if you're having a bad day, as opposed to cutting out early and heading home to regroup, you will be out longer and later. If you're having a good day and you think you're gonna get out early, think again. Since they can now see your whole day in real-time, the minute you finish your work they'll message you telling you to go help in a different area with deliveries or covering pickups for them. Don't expect to EVER get out \"early\" or eat your dinner before 7pm. It will only set you up for disappointments. You will need to be prepared to drive and deliver no matter what the temperature or conditions. 100\u00b0 and 100% humidity, torrential rain and flooding,  -20\u00b0 with 40mph winds, blizzards and ice storms - doesnt matter - we're out and delivering people's stuff. And you're not just worried about yourself and your skills - you've got to worry about grandma who's 90 and Jr. who's 16 and they're out driving in conditions they aren't equipped for. Let's not forget about Johnny the road rager who is trying to get nowhere in a hurry, and well, you get the picture. We are expected, as highly trained professional drivers to control the situation on the road around us - no exceptions.  The management is obsessed with numbers...stops per hour, mileage, time-allowance, and on and on - these numbers are both unrealistic and/or unattainable, and none of them will be able to explain to you how they arrive at these figures. As an example, oftentimes you will have 1 minute allowed for a pickup that usually ships 20-50 packages that weigh 25+ lbs - an impossible feat if ever there was one...or you'll punch out at 7pm when your last bulk pickup requires you to stay until 630pm no matter what and its a 20 minute drive from there to the center - the next morning they'll tell you that you were 2 hrs over your allowed time, meaning that you should've been off the clock by 5pm...how could that ever be possible when you're required to stay at the pickup until 630pm? If you ask them how they expect that to be possible or how they could even arrive at that asinine figure considering the circumstances - they will NOT have an answer that makes any sense, if they even attempt to give you one. If you park under a tree and a branch breaks off in the wind and cracks your mirror or windshield, you're charged with an accident. If the girl texting her boyfriend backs into your truck while you're not even in it, you're charged with an accident. A deer runs out in front of you and you hit it and crack a headlight, you're charged with an accident. These are all considered AVOIDABLE. There are 2 kinds of accidents at UPS, avoidable or unavoidable, so they say...but it's probably less than 1 of 100 that their investigation will find to be unavoidable (you wouldn't believe the stuff they tell you could've been avoided and how) - so it's basically always your fault. Even if as I said, you're not even in the vehicle at the time. They can now track EVERYTHING about the vehicle(it's called telematics), right down to whether or not the doors are open or you hit the brakes hard to stop quickly. How often and how far you back the truck in reverse. How fast you're driving at any minute of the day. Etc etc etc. This is under the guise of vehicle maintenance/fuel economy and improving the efficiency of the route, but it's really a tracking system to monitor the drivers and micro-manage every aspect of their day if they feel the need, and they WILL at some point. Even if you're doing your job well there's something that you will have to answer for in regard to telematics, like pulling from a stop with the bulkhead door open or the seat belt fully engaged. You will also have to deal with customers who are dishonest - they'll keep a package and say it wasn't received, or call in and say you were speeding or the truck damaged something on their property even though you walked the stop off from the road(this is where telematics is your friend). Sometimes it seems like everyone is trying to get some $$$ outta Big Brown, whether it be a new driveway or suing them for fake injuries - you always need to be cognizant of this...they don't think about the middle class guy they're potentially hurting - it's just a faceless mega-corporation to them and they want that unearned money. This job is literally fraught with hazards - dogs, irate customers, poorly maintained propery, and more. Avoiding them all is the name of the game, and the major key to a long and successful career with UPS."}, {"review_title": "Seasonal Work is Great for Extra Money", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I enjoyed that I could be active and move around on this job.

After 1 year of working there you receive full benefits: dental, vision, prescription, and no deductible. I have mine through Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield. After 1 year you get 2 weeks paid vacation and paid holidays. After 2 years you get 3 weeks paid vacation and it keeps going up after a certain amount of years are worked. I work with a guy who's been there for 23 years and gets 7 weeks paid vacation every year! It's awesome. It's also honest hard work and if you're not a sissy it provides a certain amount of satisfaction when the job is done for the day. You'll start out as a loader or unloader (unloading is easier). I was an unloader for a month before they promoted me to a sorter. You'll start out at $10.15 as a loader or an unloader and a sorter makes a dollar more. You also get 2 raises a year. One in February and one in August. I went from $10.15 to $12.00 in just a year and a half. If you're looking to make GOOD money, then you'll have to become a driver or work in full time management. Driver's are full time and start out at $18.75 an hour and I think full time management starts out at $60k a year but they're both seniority based jobs. Staying with the company for many years is crucial to making the big bucks. If you go into management though then you'll lose Union benefits which I hear are better than management benefits. I worked in the Cincinnati Hub by the way. Different locations might pay slightly differently, obviously. As far as management to worker relationships goes it depends on location. If you work hard then management shows a high amount of respect and will most likely give you a little bit more hours a week and also could help you climb the ladder of promotion a bit easier (even though it's mainly seniority based). You'll be working around 20-25 hours a week on average. During peak season (November 25th-January 1st), however, you can work as much as you want because they'll be needing help during the holidays. I worked 71 hours in one week and around 60 the other 4 weeks so definitely take advantage of those peak hours. The time and a half and double time rack up big time during peak. My personal advice would be to WORK HARD and IT WILL pay off. Another helpful tip to the \"out of shape people like me\" when I started is that you will definitely lose weight. I went from 225 at 6'1 to 195 in 3 months. No kidding! It's labor work. What do you expect? Oh and they also offer in-school tuition help. I think it's $2,750 in help every semester! Not too shabby! You'll work for a good company and also get free money to help aid in getting a degree wherever you go! My advice would be to take advantage of that. Go to work, go to college, graduate, become a driver and make $60k+ a year or go into full time management with that degree you received and make $60k+ a year. Win win.", "cons": "I really only have 2 cons for this company. Super hard work and if you don't want to be a driver or work in management then it takes forever to make decent money. It is hard work but like I said if you're not a wuss ball then you'll be fine. Also, try not to shoot for working on IC's/Irregs/Gold belt if you can help it. That's the easiest place to throw out your back or pull/tear something bc of obvious huge weight increases in packages. If you never become a driver or go into full time management then it'll take at LEAST 15 years of employment before you make decent money. You'll mainly need to work a second job until the 15 years is reached to afford a decent living. No complaints on the benefits, however. Loading, unloading, and sorting do get really boring after 1 year and you'll start to feel a decrease in work desire.

If you go the package car driver route and you do not have a college degree many drivers start making money, and end up buying a house, a car, having kids exd.

At the center I work at they have outdated equipment and won't fix broken equipment unless it is absolutely necessary. Because of the union everything is seniority based, so sometimes people who deserve the more skilled positions that pay more can get bumped from that job by someone who does not deserve the position but has more seniority. Some union employees will try to \"play\" the system, and use the union to get out of trouble. Once they get away with doing this a few times they think that they are invincible because the union will always protect them. As a result supervisors sometimes have trouble getting employees to follow instruction. Supervisors don't get payed enough money, and don't receive proper training.

Keep in mind that my pros outweigh the cons, as these cons are just the little things that nudge me and they are things i've experienced personally, so I just want you to be aware of it if you're looking to work for UPS. It looks like a lot, but it's just me adding detail.\r\n\r\n-If you're a college student, read this. UPS doesn't pay for your college (or give you loans or whatever) unless you're in management (supervisor and higher). I believe you need to work at UPS for about 6 months before you can apply for a supervisor position, and then if you get promoted, then the college benefits will apply. This is what i've been told by my supervisor.\r\n\r\n-Not a con really, but just be aware, the place is incredibly hot in the summer. Wear tanktops.\r\n\r\n-You will work anywhere from 3-5 hours tops per day (unless you're double shifting), with only a 10 minute break which could happen at ANY moment. I've gone on breaks 15-30 minutes into the shift because some people were late to the sort/loading aisle and they couldn't keep up with the flow of operations, and i've had breaks with only 30-45 minutes left in the shift. Whatever the case, just know this.\r\n\r\n-People have probably told you for a long time that UPS is a \"great company to work for.\" Yes, it is ... in the long, long run.  It takes a long time to get a full-time position. At my hub, it takes between 6-15 years to get a full time job. Literally. I'm on the list currently to be a delivery driver, and I think there were 600-800 others on that list with me, some of whom have been there for 5-10 years already and are STILL part-time. To add to that bonus, it's seniority-based. They don't choose the most promising people on the list, they choose those who've been there the longest. Yikes. Here's a tip though, I've spoken to at least a dozen drivers and they all recommend that you do saturday delivery while you're on that list to start (even volunteering as a driver helper), as it will help tremendously to transition you into the full-time delivery spot when the time comes. \r\n\r\n-The pay is not very good for the amount of strain and sweat we endure. Prepare to make around $500-$700/mo for a while if you're a part-timer. I'm barely getting by with those paychecks. If you're in college, this job may be suitable for you. If you're trying to find a place to settle in for the next 30 years, get another PT/FT job with UPS to accommodate your wages until you get a full time position.\r\n\r\n-They don't care if you're a hard worker. Seniority is supreme at UPS, and working physically harder and quicker than everyone else will not get you a raise or promoted faster. I'm personally tired of people telling me to \"charm\" my way up at UPS. It just doesn't work like that here. Only time will present you the opportunity, since everything is a \"list.\" I'm not saying you shouldn't work hard and be lazy though.\r\n\r\n-College education is deceiving at UPS. They're necessary for some positions obviously, but the management field is a very thin line. I was told by multiple people (mostly supervisors and even great managers) that management will accept any business degree regardless of the field of interest or the position you're trying to apply for. They just want you to \"advance yourself\" and not become a higher position just for the sake of being that. In other words, don't apply to become a supervisor JUST to be a supervisor, they want you to want more in life than to just settle in that position.\r\n\r\n-They say that safety is everything, but the equipment is unsafe. The maintenance crew prolongs the projects for months (or even years). Management tends to spend more time reminding you of the 8 keys of lifting and lowering, hazmat handling, avoiding slips and falls, and yard control than they do fixing your equipment. Also, you WILL get bruises, strains, and scratches, and other things like tendonitis. It's very easy to get hurt even if you are safe."}, {"review_title": "Like an Olympic level workout - and you're getting paid!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 May 2014", "job_title": "Warehouse Worker in Erie, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is specifically for working in the warehouse portion of a distribution center.\r\n\r\nStaying in good physical shape is NOT an issue when working at UPS inside one of their distribution centers.

They offer excellent medical, vision, and dental benefits at a fraction of the actual costs if you are a supervisor (about 30 to 35 a month if you only want them for yourself). Pay is about average for the position of PT Supervisor compared to other similar positions. \r\n\r\nThey give part-time supervisors a base salary that is supposedly based on your length of service before promotion, but I found this to be untrue, its who you know above. The base salary is based on a 5.5 hour work day/27.5 hour workweek. After you go over the 5.5 or 27.5 hours you are given an extra 10% on top of your broken down wage. Time and a half is given for going over 8.0 hours and 40 hours.\r\n\r\nAlso available is 401k matching which was maxed at 6% for part-time supervisors and in addition there is tuition reimbursement at 4,000 per year for approved courses/degrees. Stock can be purchased at a 10% discount.\r\n\r\nPart-time package handlers start at 8.50/hr here in Southern California. Benefits are free for the employees after 12 months of employment.

The union is allowed to have too much power, often leaving managements' hands tied most of the time. From as little as telling an employee to \"hurry up,\" can cause an employee to file a grievance based on \"harassment\". Often employees will look for any supervisor moving a box  or breaking a jam and will file a grievance because the suprvisor is \"stealing\" work from union employees. From what I understand this a little more exclusive to the Ontario Hub, and I understand it is not as bad in most other hubs. \r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Management does not seem to care about their part time supervisors to the effect that often times they will not defend against the grievances filed simply because they may have a good relationship with a few of the shop stewarts or because they don't want to deal with arguing. A bad relationship with your lead supervisor or manager can make it worse.\r\n\r\nRaises for Part-time supervisors are supposedly based on a combo of the shift manager or full time supervisor and a peer review. Most of the time 2 to 3% is the common raise given once a year. However, this is where either being buddy-buddy with the Manager or Full Time supervisor comes in handy so you can get a 5 or 6% raise. If you are female and somewhat attractive, it works to your advantage as you will often receive larger raises and more opportunities to advance faster without being necessarily qualified. \r\n\r\nPart Time Package Handlers only receive 8.50 an hour to start and need to pay union dues and most importantly their initiation fee. The first 4 months of employment are very difficult because you get a small paycheck after all the dues and fees are taken out AFTER taxes.
