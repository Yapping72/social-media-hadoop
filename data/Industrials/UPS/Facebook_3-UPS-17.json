The extra compensation is taken directly from all other employees.  We used to get 15% of profits  distributed to all management employees.  Now they take a HUGE chunk of that 15% and give it directly to those top 100 or 200 people.  Outrageous!  They say it's partly to offset loses by those who have options that have been worthless because the top 100 to 200 people can't grow the business.  That makes it more outrageous.  Options are to entice you to grow the business.  You don't grow it and then give yourself HUGE bonus LTIPS checks?  What exactly is the enticement for the top 100 to 200 people to grow the business?  There is none.  They just get huge checks and ask everyone else to grow the business.  It absolutely absurd.  And even worse, this is at a time when the company is experiencing RECORD PROFITS!!!  The record profits are going right into the pockets of those 100 to 200 people.  The rest of the people are simply being de-motivated because of the situation, morale is waaaaay down, performance drops as a result.  Everything is being outsourced and employees will be laid or fired (it's already occurring) and the only thing that will be left will the Operations (drivers and hubs etc.) and the 100 to 200 people getting LTIPS.  Everything else will be outsourced.  Jim Casey would be firing all those 100 to 200 and letting the real workers do it right.  The stock price has not moved because wall street sees what is happening and knows the top 100 to 200 employees are just raping the company at the expense of the vast majority of the employees.

Email is monitored; instant messaging is monitored. Employees secretly pass notes for fear of reprisal. Upper management gossip openly about each other and subordinates. Every review or survey submitted to provide feedback to UPS GBS is \"screened\" or \"filtered\". Suggestions for improvement are frowned upon as \"creating more work\" or \"rocking the boat\". Every attempt to obtain employment is \"screened\" or \"filtered\". If a supervisor or manager does not like an employee, their oversight of submitted internal applications can be sabotaged or \"not recommended\". Both practices promote bias, and when an individual in upper management has bias against an employee, there is no opportunity for advancement. The UPS Global Business Services Training Development Department should not hire interns or contractors. This department only brings interns in for the purpose of \"busy work\" with no intent to hire permanently. Contractors are fired without notices, after receiving feedback from Managers or Supervisors that work is meeting standards. The expectation is for all employees to work silently, and laughter and frequent conversation is frowned upon. There is favoritism and reprisal between leadership and employees, who are afraid to send electronic messages, but prefer to pass notes. Something is seriously wrong with the culture in one particular building and a specific  training department. I wish someone had warned me or posted a review so I would be aware of what to expect. There is constant whispering by the director and his managers and supervisors, and they are extremely unprofessional on a daily basis with the conversations and comments. The work environment is tense and hostile. Unfortunately, personnel in HR (who are in charge of the internship program) are too trusting of Directors, Managers, and Supervisors who lack integrity within their departments. They are not aware of the treatment of interns until it is too late. The friendships developed between department heads and HR create a false trust that allows department heads to manipulate while interns are misused and mistreated. Older, qualified interns are NOT desired, and this sentiment is expressed in lunch and learn sessions or within departments. If you do not want interns who are 25 and older, then do NOT hire or waste their time. Projects are assigned to interns without an introduction to the department its daily practices. Tools to complete projects are slowly \"piece-mailed\" over time, as if the department heads are setting employees up for a pass or fail test. All employees need recurring training on diversity and inclusion. They are not conscious of their unprofessional behaviors or lack of training within their own department, yet they are providing training materials globally within UPS. There is a serious problem within Global Business Services Training Development Department. Employees are miserable.

You can work here 'til you die.\r\n\r\n-UPS will subsidize your education, and has great \"additional benefits\" like cell plan and rental car discounts\r\n\r\n-Vacation starts at 2 weeks, plus 5 additional \"discretionary days\". Every 5 years, you gain another week.\r\n\r\n-The pay is good (at face value...)\r\n\r\n-Profit sharing bonuses for FT supervisors is called MIP, and starts at  ~17% of your annual salary.", "cons": "-As a large company, chances for paid advancement are minimal. Horizontal \"promotions\" are very common (aka change in role without increase in pay)\r\n\r\n-As a FT employee, your work day will be 10 hours or more, which makes scheduling time for any out-of-work activities difficult\r\n\r\n-Vacation scheduling is seniority-based, and the holidays are blacked-out (no vacation allowed from Thanksgiving week through the 2nd week of January)\r\n\r\n-Pay is based on a 10 hour work day. The reason you are paid decently is because you work way too many hours.\r\n\r\n-During holidays and \"peak\", you will often work 14+ hour days. FT positions do not pay overtime.\r\n\r\n-The MIP is based on performance of seemingly random metrics. It was very common for UPS to have record-breaking profit, but for the MIP metrics to demonstrate 70% effectiveness. Therefore, you would get 70% of 17%\r\n\r\n-In addition, the MIP needs to vest before you can access it. 20% vests each year. Therefore, you are only getting 20% of 70% of 17% of your salary...or ~2%. Obviously the longer you stay, the better this becomes... but don't expect to touch that bonus for about a decade.\r\n\r\n-As UPS is a 24-hour company, there are many shifts that run at bizarre hours of the day. You can be \"volun-told\" to be on one of these shifts with very little notice. If you turn it down, kiss your chance for advancement goodbye.\r\n\r\n-It's basically a competition of who will admit to working under the worst conditions.

Working as a PT there supervisor was hell. They treat you like garbage. They play favorites and if you're not one of their favorites then then get out ASAP. They constantly put me in unsafe situations. As a supervisor I wasn't supposed to handle any packages since that's union work. My boss loved to make me start doing union work (unload, sort, load, etc). If a union member saw me they would file a grievance and I would be sat down by my boss and the shift manager. This is the point when my boss would \"forget\" he ordered me to do the work and I would get chewed out. I have seen this happen to several people. \n\nI'd like to point out another situation that constantly created unsafe working conditions. At least several times a shift there would end up being a package jam one one of the many conveyor belts. The proper procedure is to radio the person that controls the start/stop of the belts and have them turn off the belt. You then get on the belt and break the jam and get back off the belt and have it restarted. The full-time supervisors and managers don't like it when a belt is turned off, regardless of the reason. One of them would ask why a belt was off, and they would be told I or another PT Supervisor was breaking the jam. All too often the the FT Sup or manager would ignore the fact someone was on the belt an order the guy to restart the belt with the supervisor still on it. Thankfully I knew this could happen and I made sure I didn't box myself in and get off the belt quickly so I didn't get hurt. \n\nIn my later years, while I had the boss from above, my life got even worse. My fellow supervisors as well as my boss began mentally harassing and abusing me. It's as if they made a game out of torturing me. Since my boss was in on it, he obviously didn't care. Even when my manager was around for this he didn't do anything about it. Even a complaint to HR only stopped it for about a month. I'm not saying that this will happen to you if you work as a PT supervisor. However I have seen this happen to at least one other colleague, so it's not an isolated incident. \n\nAlso be prepared to get chewed out if one of your employees get injured. Even if the injury is caused by by another department and there was nothing you could have done, you will be blamed."}, {"review_title": "Ups", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Part Time Supervisor in Jackson, MS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits pays for school, short hours , off on weekends , looks very good on a resume if your continuing a career search", "cons": "Pro management very unorganized and uneducated , full time supervisor seem to enjoy belittling the part time supervisors make the job very difficult and stressful"}, {"review_title": "Service provider", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Aug 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay, benefits.

If new won customers who tried our service but faced multiple service failures (example due to shipment missing, damage, no pickup, disputes), sales are being held accountable which is extremely unfair.

Besides, top management send email to you at 10pm and by next morning 7.30am, ridiculously ask why have you not responded to the email. \r\n4. Too many manual reports asking for the same info by management from different departments. After updated those reports, they will ask you again and again because nobody reads the report. Everyone blindly update just for the sake of updating. It gets worse if you are underperform, because they will ask even more reports from you to justify your low performance. You spend more time updating unnecessary reports instead of doing sales and thus lower conversion rate. Then they add even more reports. It\u2019s a non-ending bad cycle. \r\n5. 60% of time non responsive in email or phone call. Reply only when things being escalated up to the top management\r\n6. Company is not willing to hire more people to cope with the amount of workload. Once there is a surge of volume (example during peak season, new huge volume business won), unable to support and causes multiple failures. After customer has churned, without solving the root cause, management will push sales to re-pursue again. Cycle repeats itself until customer refused to use us again. \r\n7. Lack of authority in country level. Country level is unable to make any decision without referring to district or region. Even for hiring a replacement for sales. Country does not have the authority to use budget to held marketing events. Therefore the low exposure of UPS brand name in the local market as compared to competitors\r\n8. Cut commission without prior notice. We only get to know our commission being cut by approximately half until we get our pay slip. The ridiculous reason given was due to the person in charged was too busy to inform us earlier. No apologize from person in charged as well."}, {"review_title": "Benefits and Operational Experience You Won't Find Anywhere Else", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Feb 2020", "job_title": "Frontline Supervisor in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent benefits including the best tuition reimbursement program I have ever seen.
