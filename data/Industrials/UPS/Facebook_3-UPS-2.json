This is my first \"real\" job after doing only gig work. It's also a good job if you are a student. Or, if you are trying to get your life back on track after getting laid off elsewhere, or have a criminal history. Second chances are something you can't put a price on.", "cons": "The pay is as expected: minimum wage, which can increase when contracts are negotiated, though some co-workers of mine with a few years at the company have only had their pay raised by a couple of cents. There are plenty of other jobs you can do for minimum wage without union dues, so come here if you want a union or like the company, otherwise you can make more flipping burgers. As previously mentioned, if you want to move up to other jobs, the wait can vary. Some people move up after a few weeks, while some have to wait for years. It is all seniority-based, so your qualifications really don't matter. It is also easy to get injured at this job, particularly when the workload is heavy and you're being rushed. It can feel endless and overwhelming. You will be moving bulk, working in tight areas, lifting a lot, and most likely working with failing equipment. Your work doesn't end when the clock strikes end time, it ends when the belts are empty and. Some nights you will get held way over. Others, the load will be light, and you can get sent home after 20 minutes if you don't have guaranteed hours. If you accept the risks and wish to proceed, then good luck."}, {"review_title": "Hard Labor, Great Health Insurance, A lot of Internal Mobility", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 May 2022", "job_title": "Package Handler", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- No background check or drug test.

You can come in at the lowest level as a package handler and work your way up to 80 or 100k as a fulltime supervisor, manager, or truck driver. \n- Tuition reimbursement: available immediately after your first 30 days. good for any accredited college or university up to $5250 per year and 25k in total.
