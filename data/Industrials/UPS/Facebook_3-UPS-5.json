If you have to work 15-18 hours a day, so be it.\r\n\r\nTraining - With COVID changing the way that companies need to operate, this one definitely needs to learn in a hurry. Was supposed to start with a one week, off-site training course that was shut down at the start of the pandemic. Management made little to no effort to adapt the training to the fact that someone new was coming in and not knowing what is going on. Training pretty much consisted of \"Watch this training video. Now it's time for a face-to-face quiz. Why aren't you an expert on this, you watched a video on it?\". There were also exercises that used to be completed during off site training that needed to be done. I was finally told by management about them roughly 3 months in and that I needed to get them done, only to get a scathing email 3 days later from my manager asking why he was getting emails that I was overdue in completing them and that I needed to work on them on my time off.\r\n\r\nInterview - Extremely fast interview where things were not fleshed out like they should be. I asked one question in particular about the hands on/physical needs of the job, and was told there were none, only to spend 3 weeks climbing over a delivery truck learning the inspection process. It was also explained to me during the interview that long hours would happen once \"peak season\" started, which is November through January. Image my surprise when I was working 12 or more hours a day, into the early hours, sometimes until the sun came up, only to be expected to be on a management call everyday at 3pm. FYI, the interview lasted less than 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Work Itself - The work itself is high stress. If you are based out of the main hub, you have to deal with all the shop technicians, the phone constantly ringing from either other area shops looking for parts or drivers on the road that have broken down in one way or another, or a constant parade of drivers coming into the office to ask about the status of the truck they normally drive. If you are assigned to the satellite centers, you are constantly on the road going to them or trying to help those techs over the phone even though you might be a couple of hours away...if you are actually allowed to do the job. I spent more time at the main hub subbing for other supervisors that were on vacation or off of work for whatever reason, that I was constantly falling behind on my duties, which of course, came with either a scathing email, or a phone call about the fact I was not doing my job correctly. My favorite was once when I was already up, showered, and ready to head out the door, only to have the manager contact me to let me know I was needed at the main hub to work the 9pm-5am shift, so I had to try to go back to bed so I could stay up until the sun came up the next morning."}, {"review_title": "UPS", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A lot of overtime and a lot benefits from the jobs you can attain", "cons": "A lot of labor work"}, {"review_title": "N.A", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Public Administration in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and hours during peak", "cons": "Short hours during the year"}, {"review_title": "great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Account Executive in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "UPS is a great company to work for.
