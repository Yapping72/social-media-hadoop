Dental, for instance, is covered without even a co-pay, though the health has minimal ones.  In Washington State, there's a choice between Blue Cross Blue Shield and Aetna for the health and dental as of last year.  Domestic partnerships are covered as well, and so far without flaw in my experience, within the state by UPS.  The extension of benefits are generous in scope, and are rare this day in age, thanks to Union bargaining.  \r\n\r\nIt used to take years to advance beyond a part time position to a driving position, but within at least the Redmond, Washington Hub (and likely Seattle and Everett Hubs as well), advancement to a driving position takes a year or less based on seniority - in the past, it took four or five years at times, as they are good jobs.  However, part time employee retention is very low (over 100% attrition per year), so advancing in seniority is quick.  With displays of competence, changing positions within the part time fields is easy as well - from Loader to Unloader, Irregulars, Smalls, Sorting, etc, are transitions usually with little wait time, and often add some additional pay ($1/h additional for Sorting, for example). \r\n\r\nAttendance policies for Part Time Union work is very lax - for Loader/Unloaders especially, no-call no-show events are rarely punished, in order to retain employees.  Supervisors are at the opposite spectrum, and can expect to be fired for a similar event, or even strongly discouraged for calling in sick.  After a year, sick days amount to a week's worth, along with a week of \"Option\" days which can be taken just like sick days, and two weeks of vacation, even for part time employees.  You can expect not to be allowed to take vacation or option days towards the end of the year, during busy season.  For Part Time employees, labor past 5 hours is considered overtime, and you're provided one 15 minute break, or two if overtime extends particularly far.  Lunches are optional, but unpaid, and are typically not taken by part timers at all.  \r\n\r\nCollege tuition help for Part Time union employees is at $3,000 from the Earn and Learn program, which comes in the form of grants.  However, they seem no longer to be tax exempt - yet in the past, personal experience has seen the full sums granted without issue.  This involves registering what classes you wished to take online via the Earn and Learn website, and at the end of the quarter, faxing your info to them, basically a statement of your grades and the costs.  If approved, you receive a check up to $1,500 dollars a quarter, to a maximum of $3,000 per year, for as many as four years.  Similarly, loans are available which, so long as you continue to work at UPS, will see their principal paid off by UPS itself.  If you leave, expect to pay the whole thing back - and either way, you do have to pay the interest on the loans as well.  The interest is very high, 14% or more, and you should expect to pay more in interest than in the principal by the end of the loan term.  This seems to be handled by Wells Fargo Bank, at least in Washington state.  \r\n\r\nAnother minor perk, at least when doing a job like Loading, Unloading, or Sorting packages, is the permission to wear personal music players and listen to them.  One headphone should be off one ear, but otherwise you're free to fill what is otherwise repetitive work with books on tape, music, radio, etc, so long as you can still hear when being called.  This, of course, does not apply if you advance to management, and the trucks do not have radios. \r\n\r\nSafe working records are rewarded to whole shifts of work by BBQs of increasing scale the longer a safe run occurs, wherein free hamburgers, hot dogs, chips, soda, etc, are provided at the end of a shift.  Awards theoretically go out monthly for best work group members, and best shift member, but this happens unpredictably as well.  The schemes for rewarding employees or work groups based on performance has varied widely in the two years I've been employed, and sometimes are non-existent.  They range from sports drinks to pizza parties, depending on the time period and achievement, though consistency is not to be expected.", "cons": "An immediate warning for new workers - under a new contract, in effect after August 2008, it takes much longer for you to receive health coverage (formerly 1 month), and even longer for your family (formerly 1 month as well, now a year).  The new contract does not increase starting rates (minimum wage or $8.50, whichever is higher), but will increase wages with experience much quicker than before (to at least $16 an hour top, higher depending on the job, in a couple of years).  The Health Coverage is identical, but now handled under a different contract, setting the stage for the stripping of benefits under future contracts. \r\n\r\nContracts are voted on by all Union Members, but Drivers are much more likely to vote than Part Time employees, leading to lopsided contracts.  Wages were stagnant for a very long time for Part Time employees - if they had grown with inflation since 1980, they would be $20/h or higher.  Driving positions, however, are much better compensated, and especially with overtime can support middle class families.  \r\n\r\nPart time work is physically demanding and exposed to the environment as well.  There is not air conditioning in the summer, and heating during the winter is either only at a few select places, or completely exposed to the environment by open bay doors.  Trailers themselves are often wet, snowy, and filthy.  Packages can be heavy, dirty, and dangerous - for example, whole anchors, points unshielded, are sent with nothing more than a tag with a UPS label upon it.  You should expect to wear gloves which will leave your hands wet by sealing in moisture, or suffer cuts and abrasions in addition to callouses.  You should expect to have to provide your own boots, or be berated - they will not prevent you from working, but they will find ways to goad you into wearing them, such as denying you gloves until you purchase boots.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the lacking pay, poor conditions, demanding labor, late night hours, and now long-delayed benefits encourage a turnover rate which, at Redmond Night Sort, was well over 100% per year, and likely to get worse so long as the contract remains as is.  Which may mean it will be very easy for anyone to find work there, though most will and do quit.  \r\n\r\nAdvancing to other positions means increasing regimentation as well - UPS is notable as a company for firing employees if they fail to keep a clean desk, if they are white collar, as discussed in Eric Abrahamson and David H. Freeman's book, \"A Perfect Mess\".  This mentality seems to follow through to the lower levels, though enforcement is somewhat lax, and tightens at the upper levels of employment.  Certain policies are announced from time to time which are never rescinded, but only enforced briefly - they're forgotten about once they prove ineffective or counterproductive, which they almost always seem to be.  Expect regular tests and memorization of safety mnemonics, such as the \"Eight Keys to Lifting and Lowering\" or \"Five Keys to Preventing Slips and Falls\"."}, {"review_title": "Part-time management is a dead-end", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Apr 2010", "job_title": "Preload Supervisor in Springfield, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits are, by far, the best reason to work for UPS.  There are very few employers out there that offer part-time employees such good benefits.  Another benefit is that you know the hours you will be working everyday.

This allows you to be very flexible during the day if you desire to hold a second job, or attend classes.\r\n\r\nThe job itself is not that difficult.

It is a hard adjustment for some people to get up at 3:00 AM to go to work.  Also, starting pay is not that great.

UPS has always treated me well, but from the day I started I have been told that there are promotional opportunities.  If you take the job for extra work, then that's great.  If you want to make UPS a career, then seek out the positions that are full-time and apply for them directly.  They need part-timers to run the day to day operations, so some managers don't really want to help people develop a career with UPS because then they would have to find someone to replace you."}, {"review_title": "Good place to work if you are the type that can keep work and your personal life separate.

Upper management is constantly asking for better results, while the workers are constantly being pushed to work harder.

It is a job where you definitely get a good workout. It is fast-paced and if you are willing to take on more responsibilities and strive to always do a good job you will be given every opportunity to do so. The benefits are wonderful and cover anything that could possibly go wrong even if you are just a part time worker. The pay gradually increases and has the potential to be very sustaining if you stay around for a long time. Opportunity to advance in the company to a driver is readily available at our center, maybe not a full time driver immediately but you will be given the opportunity to try to drive if you do your time and you work hard so that the management takes you into consideration.", "cons": "Unfortunately, outside of peak our center does not keep enough people on staff -or- they do not push everyone on the staff to balance the work appropriately. They do take advantage of the harder workers (floaters) and let them handle all the slack in the building. Also, it feels to me like the people who think that UPS pays wonderfully do not pay attention to the fact they are being really screwed if they are just in it for the money during the first several years while waiting to be a driver. People say \"Management sucks, don't enter it\" but if your entire ambition is to just be a part-time supervisor as opposed to using that position as a stepping stone inside or outside of the company you are missing the point of becoming one. If you become a supervisor you are immediately making more money and learning more things about being in an administrative position within a company which is the primary way that you are ever going to move up to a position above that. You also are around to learn more about the operations of the company. I do feel like people are brainwashed to believe that driving is the only way to be successful in the company, but it is also a very taxing job and I think people would be wise to recognize that if they push themselves they can serve alternative purposes and make themselves appear more valuable in the long run. But the worse con is that if you work mornings, you work approximately 4am-9am most of the year and around Christmas start time is even earlier generally. The reason this is such a bad thing is that when you realize what I realized (that the pay is not that stellar when you are only working 20 hours a week) that you are going to need another job, your only options are part time jobs, retail/food service, and that every job that will pay over 12 dollars an hour is going to be second shift and you will have to split your sleep schedule 4 hours before UPS and 4 hours before your other job. Then when it comes around Christmas time, you are likely unable to hold both jobs at the same time because you simply wont get any sleep between UPS and your second job when you are starting at 1 am."}, {"review_title": "Overall cool place to work.

This makes total sense when you realize that there is a huge difference in the monthly pension payment before and after one turns 55.  In my opinion, this causes a few problems.  First, there are very few opening in the upper management.  I know of many upper managers who, as it was widely known, were given \"special\" assignments for their last year or two that equated to executive day-care.  Secondly, because these openings are few and far between, no one wants to \"rock the boat\", so to speak, and endanger their slim chance for advancement.  No one will give any type of feedback that could be construed as negative.  If you get one strike, you are out!  When I had serious concerns with what were deemed important initiatives, I personally have been told to keep those concerns to myself because I might offend someone.  Or worse, I might be asked to take over that project!  UPS used to pride itself by having managers that were \"constructively dissatisfied\" and worked to make things better.  Now it seems if you utter one word of criticism, you are branded a malcontent.  The last downside to working at UPS are the unions.  Their personal healthcare costs are never increased while every year the management finds itself responsible for more and more of their own healthcare costs.  And every 5 years when their contract is up for renewal, you find yourself holding your breath that the union does not walk out again and significantly drop the stock price because a lot of your bonuses are tied up in company stock.

As management there is also the bonus incentives given each year based on company performance and meeting shareholder and internal expectations. We have offices in over 100 countries and once in management there is a good deal of flexibility for transfer for school reasons or if a spouse gets relocated. The pride that UPSER's have for not only the company but for the customers is one that is very unique and not found in many other fortune 500 companies. There is a great deal of focus and importance put on the customer and working together to achieve their goals is something that often times requires the work of many different people and/or departments to accomplish. There are very few other companies or organizations that can offer such a wide array of departments and work experience. The amount of different job functions and departments within the company can provide job potential for someone with an engineering degree, a business degree, a computer degree, a marketing degree, etc... so there is a lot of opportunity for growth within the company. With all the various departments there is a great deal of opportunity for movement to gain cross-fucntional training to really learn how each department impacts the flow of packages and data within the network. One thing that UPS is very good at is moving people around to get experience in various functions of the day to day business so they get the big picture.", "cons": "The hours required to accomplish everything that is typically expected of a full time supervisor are greater then many other full time salary supervisors in other companies. Based on the department or operation you are working in the average day can be from 10 or 12 hours to 14 to 16 hours depending on the projects being implemented or the time of year. The holidays are not fun for anyone who works in management at UPS in the day to day operational functions or planning functions. There is no such thing as family time after the week of Thanksgiving until after the New Years Day holiday and there is little to no flexibility for time off during this period as well. Many days during the Christmas holiday season require many full time management to work 16 to 18 hour days if not longer on some occasions leaving no time for family activities since you are usually too tired to move when you return home. Most of the management I work with have grown to hate the holiday season as much as I have in the past 3 years of working these kinds of hours which often times include Saturdays and sometimes Sundays. If it weren't for the ability to do almost all my Christmas shopping online I wouldn't probably be able to find the time to actually go to the mall and shop during the month of December. Another downside is the union aspect and how much control they have. It is very disheartening when management is able to build cases against hourly union employees to get them terminated just to have the union get them their job back time and time again. Not all employees that are members of the union abuse the system but there are still a lot that do and it makes if very difficult to hold employees accountable when you can't rightfully terminate them and make it stick. This frustrates young management when they see this and gives off the impression that management has no power or authority to terminate problem employees. Finally the last downside is the lack of notice when a move or change is made. Often times when a management change is made it is kept very secret and typically not told to the affected employee(s) until a day or two before. This can cause a lot of strain on peoples family lives at home where their spouse or significant other is affected by the change in positions which often times involves changes in the hours or time of day."}, {"review_title": "UPS- Great Place to Be", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Jun 2008", "job_title": " in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "UPS is a great, stable company.

They are splitting these jobs and making you work two  different shifts. How can anyone have a life if they have to drive back and forth twice a day and work four hours each shift. Or sleep in the parking lot because you can't drive all the way home. And to those who say there was a tour before we were hired....Hahahahahaha. There are videos we watched too and they are nothing like reality. Once you are vested in a pension it's not an easy thing to walk away and not collect that pension which would be quite small, until your mid sixties. People here are just telling it like it is for the next guy. I'll bet about eighty percent of the workforce doesn't really like the job they are in. Most new hires don't make it a week. And as far as a workout while getting paid...that's how I looked at it when I was twenty. Then I had two hernia surgeries, and repeated back problems. They expect you to sort or load in excess of 300 packages an hour. A body isn't made for that and it takes tough, tough people to last until retirement in this company.

Sadly our hard work was repaid by having my best supervisors get transferred to terribly performing centers. If you are a top performer, you are moved continuously around even against your will. They say it's to help you learn as much of the business as possible, but it just satisfies their needs instead of yours, because your bonuses are tied directly to your current center. So to go from a top performing center to one with bad numbers means losing your bonus. Think about that having to work harder in a new area and getting paid less. However, upper management said they will address that issue by increasing our base pay and removing bonuses! Then what is the point of being a top performer if you get paid the same as everyone else? I think that is my biggest gripe with the company other than the constant yelling at all levels of the business.

It's great hours for early risers, and allows you to be able to work on other important projects during daylight hours if you need to. For those who appreciate keeping physically active while they work - this may be the job for you. You can get well over 10,000 steps in within a 5+ hour work shift.  Remember to not strain yourself with lifting boxes that are too heavy without asking for assistance.

They also sometimes assume that those they hire that have worked for other companies such as Fedex will know how to do the job - which is not true. Most importantly; UPS seems to not care much about making sure they calculate your hours correctly. You had best to keep track of your schedule and check behind whomever enters your work hours if you want to be sure that you are getting paid for all hours and minutes worked. When the holiday rush was over, they called us in for a couple days then literally laid us off prematurely and abruptly without any advance notice; (they told us at end of January we would be done.) This showed a great lack of concern for employees that helped them out during their busiest season of the year and have bills to pay.  We seasonals were hired on with incorrect information about how much our hourly wage would be.  It was much less. Hiring managers were helpless it seemed; as the change was tied up in union and corporate red tape. The FREE insurance will not kick in until you have become a full-time or regular employee for nine months; that does not include the months that you worked as a seasonal worker! The company is reportedly dealing with corporate instructions to cut back on their expenses - so they send some workers home early when they are done with what they usually do- instead of sending them to help with the overload of work that other employees have on their hands.  They also did not hire on some of us that were proven hard workers with great work ethics. We were told corporate may not be hiring on regulars as much as in the past or at all.

I averaged about 50-60 hours a week  and realized something had to change. I had no idea where to even begin to look I had been in the same career for ten years. my brother n law has worked for ups for years and told me to please apply and give it a chance cause he really knows I would like the job, the company and the values they stand for. so far this company has far exceeded my expectations not only with the amazing 8-5 schedule but all of the people from Hope at the front desk who always greets us with a smile every morning and has the coffee going to Carmen in HR who is always so genuine in wanting to help you and our AMAZING trainer Billy who is one of the best facilitators I have been educated by and this is in comparisons to all my professors in school and previous job. you can tell that he absolutely loves his job and is genuinely here to help mold and create successful ISR's, no matter what question it is. The values that ups have are right aligned with mine and in this world that we live in now I didn't think it was possible to find a corporation like that any more. There are so many resources in the building even out side of the building and no matter what corner you turn or hallway you walk down there is somewhere to tell you \"Hello, Good Morning, Good Afternoon, and even to answer any questions you may have. as you can imagine being a mother to a now five year old it was a HUGE decision for me to leave a company I had established a great reputation and career with.

So they'll promote almost anyone. Which is scary, I don't think they realize how much a part-time supervisor can impact the morale of the employees day in and day out. A big reason I quit a couple of years ago, Was because I had a Part-time supervisor that was hard to work with.\r\n\r\n- The chance of you being able to go full time is small. If you want to go, driver, Sometimes you get lucky. But if you want an in-hub job. (Aka Combo) you may have to wait ten years or longer to get up the seniority list. (That's my hub) \r\nIt's hard to make a career at UPS when you don't have the type of opportunity. \r\nNew hire pay is currently:  10.20 an hour, With 19-25 hours a week.\r\nWhich isn't enough to live off of. But still a nice check for those who need part-time work. \r\n\r\n- Working a second job with UPS can be difficult, While your shift stays the same every day. You get exhausted physically so the balance can be hard. Loading 1,500-3,000 boxes in one night, Then working somewhere else is difficult.  Which is another reason why Full time would help! \r\n\r\n- If you quit and come back, You'll start off back at New hire wage, And NO seniority. I think that we should get 1 chance to come back and still get our seniority Or at least, Most of it. And our old wage. I worked for UPS for 4 years, and came back 1.5 years later. It's a bit frustrating being back as a \"New hire\".  Which makes me less likely to make this job that I love dearly, a career. \r\nUPS is losing a lot of amazing people due to this. Sometimes big things in life can interfere with our ability to stay. So 1 chance of coming back would help a lot of us. But also having that \"limit\" would make it fair for everyone else.

I am a loader which requires me to put a large amount of packages into a sem-trailer in a relatively short amount of time. It is relatively simple. Their are all kinds of safety events to get free t-shirts at UPS. The work itself is much like a workout, with emphasis on the back and legs.", "cons": "Well there are a lot of problems that one will encounter as a part-timer. You basically have no pull until you put in around 2-3 years at UPS or unless you memorize a lot of zip codes to get pumped up in job class to a pickoff/sorter. Loading and Unloading are two separate animals with different problems. The one I know well is the job of a loader, and it is very stressfull. Every day the manager will reveal your performance, mostly looking at how many scans you had per hour and how many errors you made(misloads). The problem with this system is that their are literally hundreds of scenarious you will face that will diminish each of these evaluators. One being your manager will make you take cart fulls of packages to the missort belt, killing your scans per hour. Another problem occurs if you are in a very slow chute/ have to help break jams for other loaders/pick 70 plus pound irregs off the floor. The real issue it the misload situation, as too many will lead any new hire to a termination. I have just recently gotten past my first 30 days without a misload to my name to acquire senior status. That may not seem like a big deal to most, but during this period I was \"salted\"(purposely given incorrect packages by management) at least 30 times a night.. It is part of the job I understand, but when loaders often help other loaders scan or use their scanner it creates an opportunity for disaster. When your supervisor asks you for your scanner you are pretty much trusting him with your job. \r\n\r\nOk another con of the job is the obvious weird hours. Kiss your loved ones goodbye plus any possible semblance of a normal life if you choose to do the Night shift or Sunrise shift. And really, if you are working at UPS during the other two shifts you should reevaluate how important this company is to you. I have another job in addition to attending my master's program. The only reason I work at UPS is because of the weird hours but at the same time they are my undoing. I feel like a zombie on my days off. As far as UPS being all that bad in terms of management, I don't really think that is true. It is very typical of a large company to have underqualified leaders, so one should just be prepared. They care about you, but just like anyone they are looking for the next big thing. The start times of work also change almost daily so that makes it very difficult to not WASTE time in the parking lot or in the hub at your PD.\r\n\r\nI have heard that unloading is very difficult. They have to move much faster than we do as loaders and are expected to be able to position packages correctly regardless of their weight. Less time means less pay thus making it important to evaluate time in transit to work. \r\n\r\nThis is a workout but not one that will get you muscular. Well, besides your back. But God help you when it gives out. Your forearms will spazz on you after awhile. You will sweat terribly and lose weight. I eat like Michael Phelps now and I still cannot keep up as I went from 188 lbs. to barely 170 lbs. in about 3 months time of working as a loader. Worse yet is that you cannot workout after doing this, so they tell you \"its like getting paid to work out\" but it doesn't make any sense.\r\nOverrall I wouldn't do this if I were you, and I plan on getting out sooner than later."}, {"review_title": "Be cautious", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "can add on another job and be comfortable\r\nno weekends, ever\r\ndecent amount of holidays off\r\nsemi-stability of the company", "cons": "IT IS UNIONIZED!\r\nupper management are always nervous about their jobs\r\nseems to be no opportunity for advancement\r\nno mention of promotion after earning education\r\nupper management will pawn off failures/headaches with union on lower management"}, {"review_title": "Good place for college students", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 May 2012", "job_title": "Sorter in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Haven't received the benifits yet, but from what I hear they are great.

Drivers would be dispatched to my POD and the packages would be placed in the POD. I'd sort the packages, load them up into my cart/trailer, and deliver them by hand to people's houses throughout a greater neighborhood.\r\n\r\nI got lucky. My particular area was in a nice and shady, richy-rich country club area. Even on the busiest days on my route, I'd typically never go over five hours of work time. The people that lived there were (typically) friendly, but the employees rarely were. There wasn't much traffic, even for a country club, so there was rarely any traffic. If you're looking for a job where you can work temporarily, work by yourself and at your own pace, this is the kind of job you're looking for.\r\n\r\nJust, again, note that I got lucky. On a few unfortunate days, I was forced to jump for a driver, and on several occasions we'd stop to help other cart jumpers with their loads. A single cart driver can have a literal gigantic steel shipping container FULL of packages. One poor individual had so much in his container that even after working from 9 AM to almost dark, he still had hundreds of stops left. So be warned that your experience can and will vary. I intend to attempt to work temp for UPS again for the holidays in 2014, as well, in the hopes that I again get the same route I'd been doing this year.\r\n\r\nWorking for the company was, for the most part, smooth. I saw another reviewer on this website that complained about the fact that they were given paper paychecks instead of direct deposit. They warned me right off the bat this would be the case and that direct deposit (and other benefits) was/were only for part-time and full-time employees, not for temp help.\r\n\r\nIf you need some extra holiday money, want to get your foot in the door at UPS and aren't adverse to working out all day and getting paid to do it, then consider applying for temp help.", "cons": "The workload is ridiculous, and there aren't enough people to handle the workload. This is why you'll often hear stories of drivers (and helpers) staying out WAY past dark just to get their deliveries all done. These are all true. If you're looking for a short job that'll net you some extra holiday cash, be wary that many days you'll be working a MINIMUM of eight hours. I got lucky in that my route as a cart jumper was light enough that I was done in four to five hours most days.\r\n\r\nThey tell you that you need to be able to lift more than 70 lbs. in order to do the work, but on SEVERAL occasions I was forced to move 80+ lbs. packages SEVERAL times throughout the day, and not trivial distances, either. I also had to lift these over several feet to load them onto my cart's trailer. This meant they had to be lifted in AND out. UPS states that these packages need to be team lifted, and that these instances are 'errors', but I think they're full of it. I can't count the days on both hands when I had several packages over 70 lbs..\r\n\r\nAgain, the workload is ridiculous, and not just for you, but also for their operations people. The UPS place near my house that gave me general training is a surprisingly small operation for such a large place, and having been in their office, they're clearly lacking the room needed to function properly. I can't help but wonder how many shipping centers are like this. It is, to say the least, an enormous mess.\r\n\r\nAs a result, there will be days when you'll be sitting there as a cart jumper wondering when they're going to call you to meet your driver at the POD. There were more than a few days when I had to call THEM to remind them I existed. Their inconsistency as an operation upset me on more than one occasion. In addition, I was forced a total of three separate times to go acquire a uniform from them. Once when I began, another time after I was told to turn in my uniform on Christmas Eve and they needed me in the days following, and then again the day after New Years Day.\r\n\r\nWhether you're driver helper or cart helper, you're going to run into adverse weather eventually. Living in Florida, there were several days in which it rained. Cold, freezing rain. I was given nothing to potentially protect my packages, and I'm honestly surprised after standing in the pouring, freezing rain for several hours that I didn't catch pneumonia, let alone a cold.\r\n\r\nThe golf cart operations are iffy at best. There are many days when you'll wonder if your golf cart is even going to work properly. I was lucky in that my golf cart only failed once, and when it failed, it was a catastrophic failure. It wouldn't move. I had to have the cart completely replaced with a 'new' one, by that I mean, an old one. I was informed that these carts are poorly maintained after the holiday rush and then left in storage for the rest of the year. If the cart drives the next year when it's time to get them out to their locations, then it's good to go. It shows.\r\n\r\nSo while the job is hectic, it's good money (I got paid $8.50 when I was told I'd be paid $8.25 - not a huge amount, but hey, money's money), you just need to understand fully what you're getting yourself into, because the people recruiting are so desperate for temporary help that they don't feel the need to fully warn you about what to expect. They also love to tempt you with the prospect of being fully hired onto the team, when your chances of getting hired no matter how amazing your performance is are slim to none."}, {"review_title": "Only good for long-term stay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Jul 2014", "job_title": "Part Time Package Handler in Ontario, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You cant really get fired that easily as any other job.

Being in a warehouse with a lot of running machinery, poor ventilation, and no air conditioning often means you will be physically uncomfortable for most of your job, especially during the summer months.\r\n\r\nBecause hourly employees are union-based, seniority is the only thing that matters as far as compensation. This often creates a workforce that is complacent. This is further perpetuated by the fact that if people work slower, there is obviously more work left to be done-- and if there is more work to be done, the higher seniority people are allowed the first bid on that work by union contract.

I was told the coordinator would contact me the first day to tell me where to report for work.  \r\n\r\nSecond, the driver did not have my uniform on the truck as I was told.  He had to loan me his jacket that day.  \r\n\r\nThird, the driver thought I had completed DIAD training (the hand-helds used to scan packages and get signatures).  He was told driver helpers would know what to do.  He was frustrated I was not trained on it.  Because of time constraints, we worked around this and he scanned packages for me to just deliver.  \r\n\r\nThe second day on the job, I had a different driver.  I was told in orientation I would be paired with one driver.  Anyway, this driver ended up having my uniform.  Again, we worked around the DIAD system due to time constraints.  This driver was unpleasant to work with and she wanted me to jog through wet leaves and on slippery residential staircases because \"I need to hustle\".  She was incredibly impatient with me for someone being only the 2nd day on the job.  I almost wanted to end my assignment that day.  I ended up reporting this incident to a supervisor later because the jogging around on slippery surfaces was in direct violation of the safety procedures and the supervisor made it clear that I am never to compromise my safety.  He appreciated my report.  On the third day of work, I was paired with the driver from my first day, which was a relief.\r\n\r\nFourth day on the job, I was paired with yet ANOTHER different driver.  This time, I got a patient, grounded person who took the time to train me on the DIAD.  He was good to work with.  I addressed the driver/helper pairing discrepancy with him and he didn't know what happened but said he and I will be working together for the duration of the season.  Thank goodness.

After Christmas is over, UPS cancels all phone numbers provided to seasonal employees and there is no possible way to get a hold of anyone. You can't even tell them you're available for work and you can no longer ask the status of your check. Once Christmas is over, you are disposable and they show it by how easy they no longer want to be in contact with you.

Don't get me wrong, unions are great and all to make sure that you can't get fired for stupid reasons and you have Protections in case something happens. But as a supervisor it makes it extremely difficult. Employees that intentionally work as slow as possible can do this because the union protects them from getting fired for not performing. This is why the hard workers will get taken advantage of, because the union protects all the lazy ones that won't let us get rid of.\r\n\r\nAs a supervisor I wasn't supposed to handle any packages except to help an employee lift a heavy package or break a jam, stuff like that. It's actually a union violation for us to do so, which I guess I agree with. Problem was my Supervisors would constantly force me to work and I of course would get caught and get yelled at by the same people making me do the work. \r\n\r\nNow comes the fun part, Safety. UPS constantly preaches working safely, and with the union employees they do an OK job with. As for Supervisors it was horrible. I would constantly be told to walk on moving belts which is very dangerous, and they would also start a belt when they knew I was standing on it breaking a jam, not seeming to care that I could fall over and I could hurt myself on the Belt starts.

Don't get me wrong, unions are great and all to make sure that you can't get fired for stupid reasons and you have Protections in case something happens. But as a supervisor it makes it extremely difficult. Employees that intentionally work as slow as possible can do this because the union protects them from getting fired for not performing.

The operations divisions are high-intensity, high energy places.  This can be physically and mentally draining with the long hours and the higher and more numerous standards the management is judged by, but it also creates a special kind of camaraderie as well.  \r\nAlthough the company became public in 1997, there's still a culture of \"partnership\" between management at the supervisor level and above which is held over from the days when the company was privately held, and management were the only one who held stock in UPS.  UPS is also a very stable company with excellent cash flow.  This typically means if you're the type who wants to work for one company their entire career and not jump around a lot you can still do that here.  The variable labor cost model typically means that UPS doesn't have to resort to layoffs during mild economic downturns.  If you're single or married to a non-working spouse and don't plan to have a family, there are numerous opportunities to advance by relocating to other parts of the company every 4-5 years throughout your career.  \r\nThis is a male-dominated company for reasons typically related to the work environment.  UPS does not discriminate against women in any way, but most women simply find that the warehouse environment doesn't suit them.   If you're a woman in entry level management and don't mind a warehouse environment, you will be given every opportunity to succeed and advance as UPS is actively trying to bring more women into its management ranks and retain them.  You'll have to be competent, but frankly, in the current environment here, if you're up against a man with the same qualifications for a promotion, in my opinion, you'll get it.  You'll be encouraged to get on a career track to move ahead quickly unless you explicitly make it known you don't want to do so.", "cons": "Driving and inside operations jobs are physically grueling compared with typical jobs.  While your average Marine or construction worker would think it was easy, the majority of the population find it to be one of the toughest things they've ever done, and many can't do it well.  This \"truck driver\" mentality still extends into management, and though the company has multiple work life balance initiatives, it is difficult to do many operations management jobs properly and work less than 55-60 hours per week.  For the engineers, in can sometimes be difficult to implement operating plans with operations people who work 10-15 hours per week more you do.  The operations management team will feel the engineering team doesn't understand the challenges they face.\r\n\r\nAnother significant downside for some people is that in order to advance into middle management or beyond you have to be willing to relocate to another area at a moment's notice.
