I've seen The managers get in loaders face and yell at the good employees for not doing the bad employees work for them. There is no reward for doing a \"good job\". In the 2 years ive been there, I cant recall a time where i was given a simple \"Thank you\" for working hard. The Senior management degrades and screams at part time and full time sups to the point of tears on a daily basis which is then directed to the hourly employees through their frustration. If you're a female or gay, be cautious, sexual harassment is a very big issue here from both the hourly employees and Sups. The overall morale is low. If you get injured, they beg you to not file an injury report and want you to \"Give it a few days\" then when you come back they will tell you its to late to file a report. Most people are miserable and dread coming to work every day. Along with this, they are SO unorganized. How can we get an envelope from here to Germany in 24 hours but we \"loose\" Trailers in our own yard that ends up getting pushed out 10 min from when the drivers are leaving and now we have a thousand packages that arent getting delivered so we end up having more work the next day.
