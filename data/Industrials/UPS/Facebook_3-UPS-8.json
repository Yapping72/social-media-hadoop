A mechanic never came. I was stranded in the middle of nowhere tapping the trucks alternators for 4 hours in a thunder storm trying to get my truck to work. When I finally got the truck to work I came back to the warehouse and dropped the truck off with a mechanic. Since the truck broke down I did have some package left on the truck. I took them to my supervisor and I was asked why I came back to the warehouse and why I didn't just drop the remaining packages off at their destination. I explained my situation again in which I was told to \"never come back to the warehouse when there are packages on the truck\". I said ok and prepared for the next day. The next day came and it was officially my third day driving on my route. The Mechanic confirmed the repairs had been fixed and my truck was now fine. On this day my truck broke down several times and I was once again stranded in middle of nowhere. I called and explained the situation to my supervisor in which they advised just calling a mechanic and wait for their assistance. No assistance was given and had not been for a police cruiser passing I would have been stranded on some random road in the middle of nowhere. Once again I got the truck to work and took it back to the warehouse. I dropped the truck back off with a mechanic and I was told \"I am glad you came back to the shop cause I was not trying to go out there and get you\". Furious on the inside I kept my composure and just replied I understand. Once again I had packages left and reported to my supervisor. I was told to get any truck and deliver the remaining packages. I grabbed the only truck I could find, loaded my packages on and headed out. Everything was going well until that truck broke down as well. For my remaining weeks I faced many issues like this. I can truly say I gave my very best effort and tried to work with the issues I faced. The combination with dealing with management that didn't seem to care about my safety and were only worried about packages being delivered and mechanics who didn't want to do their job was a lot to deal with. Also me and other rookie drivers were told we had to wait a whole year to get full benefits and that if we got hurt with in 30 days our job would be gone. I didn't think they were serious until one of my co-workers got hurt while out delivering and confirmed it was true. I can say UPS has the most unethical work environment ever and it truly feels like prison on the inside. Also when I applied for the position the UPS website job description said I would get paid 21 an hour. When I started working I made $14.50 and hour and after training I made $20.50 an hour. I asked for an explanation but never got one. Also the new uniforms that were promised were never received.

The worst thing by far in my experience was that my full-time supervisor (boss) would NEVER write up people. I had workers that would come in hours late or not show up at all and have no repercussions because they are union. Also when workers know that their full time bosses do that, they take full advantage (who wouldn't??) Part-Time supervisors have no power in the management world there. You have to also screw over your workers to cover load spots that are supposed to be filled with employees that are supposed to be at work or you have to load the spot yourself since everything comes down to numbers on the management side.
