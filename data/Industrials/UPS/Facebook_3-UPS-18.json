Certain employees get special treatment for kissing up, Others are treated unfairly because they don't tow the line and keep their heads down. This problem goes from the first day workers right up through the ranks. Even management has this issue. As long as you play company politics you can get what you want. Working hard and asking for things will rarely get you anything. To the point that anyone who starts out as a hard worker just becomes lazy. There is no reason to work hard when the alcoholic who's late every day gets everything that you've been asking for while you get snubbed.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Corruption. Union Representatives (Shop Stewards) who have been around a long time tend to be corrupt. They are untouchable by management so they tend to be extremely lazy and unwilling to do anything to improve your work conditions. Failure to report management doing union employee work, Sitting on the job, Failure to report safety hazards and even causing safety hazards are just a few things.  But the real problem is how they ignore problems that management should fix and in return management gives them the job they want to do and ignores the laziness. Nothing like having a 50+ year old lazy overpaid jerk doing a fast paced job slowly and causing the rest of the team to have to pick up the slack.\r\n\r\nThird, Safety. I have never worked in a job as unsafe as the UPS location i'm at now. On a weekly bases we have a truck driver pull off the doors with an employee in the trailer. It has caused injuries in the past and yet the core of the problem has not been addressed.  They value speed over safety.  Equipment is horribly outdated and under repaired. Steel rollers that carry hundreds of pounds of packages have cracks and broken supports and are never repaired even after as much as a year of asking for it. Dangerously unsafe floors, There is no non-slip protection anywhere. the floors are all smooth concrete that gets soaked with the slightest rain, They say that the reason for this is because we are supposed to have non slip soles (we do by the way). The floor is even dangerous with non slip soles and although a simple rubber mat in some places would fix the issues they instead prefer to maintain a dangerous  condition.\r\n\r\nOh, you might as well forget about safe work practices. They'll make sure you have  safe lifting procedures drilled into your skull but you better not  actually try to be safe. That's too slow. Load stands? too slow. Lifting with your legs? too slow. Team lift? bwahahaha. All you need to do is memorize the safety manifesto so that we can pretend to be safe at the audit.\r\n\r\nOh and you better hope there isn't a fire. Because of the speed over safety attitude we just run the conveyor at ridiculous rates that overwhelm the guy that has to do 2 employees worth of work so that packages are falling over the floor and blocking egress. That's ok. as long as we make PPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the worst job you will ever have. It's a revolving door. i've been here over 2 years and there has been a non stop hiring cycle ever since. they cannot keep employees. and for good reason.

I called the coordinator to report the situation (as we was told) and the coordinator got upset with me and hung up in my face. So I called the manager because I decided to quit because they was very unprofessional. They kept on calling my phone asking did I want to meet them to start working, (remind you that I had already quit) I tried to explain to them that I already quit but they kept insisting that I should work. So one of the manager's offered me a position inside the warehouse so I gave them one more chance. Wish I would've never did that because the situation got worse. I was told that I should start December 11, 2017 at 6pm, I got there around 5:24pm to find parking and from that moment I stood in the cold with 6 other people. We was told to wait for some guy (in which he was unprofessional as well) so he can take us to the floor. So time went by while a coworker and I conversed with one another, I look at the time it was almost 7:00pm and we was still in the cold. So I call the guy and he didn't answer. So he walked pass us (not knowing that was him) and didn't say anything to us. So now I'm beyond angry because he came back around 7:15 (an hour and 15 minutes after our shift suppose to had started) saying \"who y'all waiting for\". So i spoke up and said his name, he said with an attitude \"well I'm the guy and i didn't see y'all right there\"! I was shocked because he seen us and he had the nerve to lie, yell and become very rude. So I asked \"is all of your names ******\", he replied with anger \"yes thats everyone name\"!!!

The goal of a Hub or Center worker is ultimately to become driver unfortunately this can take a very long time and the package handlers are part-time employees.  One of the most discouraging aspects I encountered is that every 7th package car driver hire is an out of union hire and this creates a lot of animosity with people who have been working in the warehouse for years especially if it is a non union supervisor who are also eligible for the 7th hire. There are many situations were someone will have worked there for a decade and see some kid get hired off the street and get the position you've been trying to get for years. Also because of the union you get stuck working with people who are absolutely worthless but simply can't be fired. I worked with two guys who got in a physical altercation (pushing) at work and both retained their jobs. Another con is the vitriolic relationship between union workers and corporate, and it can get really bad. Now this is purely anecdotal but a lot of old timers talked about how the company used to be amazing and considered one of the best companies to work for before it went public in 1999. Corporate seems absolutely aloof and because of the Union are almost adversarial. I worked at both a large hub and a center, the problems I illustrated were prevalent in both but much more pronounced in the latter. I would not recommend working for UPS if you are looking for a career but if you need to work through school or are in need of a temporary job it's great because of the benefits which you get as a part time employee. If you do want to make a career out of it make sure you find out how many people are ahead of you in seniority and frankly how old the package car drivers look (ie close to retirement) because chances are you will be a part time employee for five years at least.

Upper management has little to no respect for their employees and treat them badly on a regular basis, which I beleive is a direct reflection of the company.  There is absolutely no incentive for me to do a good job, other than to not be scorned.  They definitely do not pay you enough to have a sense of pride in your work.  It is tough when your boss's boss has no college education and you have a degree, working directly under this person who barely knows how to run an operation or effectively communicate to his employees without constantly attempting to belittle them on a daily basis. Also, transportation can be rough if you do not have a car, and if you come into the company and do not get promoted, don't expect to keep the car you have because you won't be able to keep up the costs of owning a vehichle.

You can try and make it your union employees problem but the union will back them up so really its on you. You'll get used to hearing about how the company is gearing up to cut costs.

They don't care about their employees any more than the union contract requires. High stress, low reward.\r\n\r\nIneffectual and uninformed management. They are slaves to the system. They begged me to work for them full time after the season ended. I've gotten 3 or 4 calls since last season ended asking me when my start date is. Their system wouldn't allow me to submit an application because when I applied for full time before I took the seasonal gig, I was rejected, and if you get rejected, the system puts a hold on your profile. But management doesn't know or understand that so they just string you along. The right hand doesn't talk to the left. My advice is, don't apply for a full-time/part-time job first. Just wait til september/october and apply for seasonal. Work your actual butt off and go from there. But I make no guarantees. HR doesn't know how the system works. They don't seem to even know that there's a system. They will call you when they need you, but if you call them, they don't answer, they won't return your call, they won't respond to voicemails. The ineptitude of their HR department is like borderline illegal. \r\n\r\nAlso, rain. You will get soaked. It will be cold. The carts have no windshield, which can be tough even on a dry day, but when it rains, each drop hits your face like a little bullet. Also, you have to throw a tarp over your packages to keep them dry so you spend even more time standing in the rain. There is no jacket, poncho, waterproof layering, that will help that even a little bit. I even bought water resistant boots for this job and they might have made things worse. If a puddle was ankle high and I couldn't get around it, the water just goes went right over the edge and pooled inside the boots. You need to embrace the water. Pretend it can't hurt you, that it has no power over you. Pretend that you want to get soaked. If you fight it, it will break you. My best rain days were the days I dressed the lightest. I wore athletic shorts and a sweat wicking shirt and beat my chest and dared the rain to get me. I'd still get soaked but my attitude was better. I wouldn't go home feeling like a wreck. You have to wear boots so get some that are light and don't worry about waterproof.

Supplies are scarce and limited most times. We use to have an employee relations index survey to rate management but they took that away along with 100 other things I used to have. No bonuses, no Christmas turkey, definitely no gold watch. I am in shock how much management is in the dark about how thier own business is run, basically I get brand new bosses every few years and they give worse and worse treatment to employees. Borderline harassment!  I think it's time to leave before things get any worse for me. We have way too many supervisors, managers, bosses, so communication between management doesn't really exist.\r\nThe work is so hard it causes heart attacks. True story.

At the same time, my husband with over 15 years experience as a FAST CDL Delivery driver took a position with UPS Freight. They dictated exactly how he could get in & out of the truck, gave him 3 seconds to be in, buckled, started, & moving, gave him unusable equipment while constantly harping about speed (he got written up because the truck axle broke - he should have found a workaround), gave him 10 minutes in the lot to park, inspect the truck & trailer, complete paperwork, & report to supervisor for next assignment (stingy companies give 30 mins for this), sent him out with destroyed freight with orders not to accept rejections - to force the customers to accept destroyed shipments, refused to let him use GPS or maps to find his way around a huge new city (have to memorize your town), forbade left turns, & constantly harassed him over speed & completely arbitrary rules that only a psycho could make up. He was required to recite about 8 pages of these crazy rules from memory anytime a superior asked, without slowing down or stopping his work.

The Ontario building for example is one of the largest, but is one of the most hated buildings to work at. It's as if every department is pitted against each other even though they're supposed to work in tandem. No one wants to ever take responsibility for anything and the blame always gets shifted from one person to the other. If one person chooses to take responsibility.. it only looks bad on them and other people will just take advantage of that and continue to shift the blame towards them. No one cares to try to understand how the other departments may work. Even when someone attempts to explain.. it's usually ignored. This leads to further conflict between departments. I hate my job because everyone thinks that I don't do anything. The job doesn't entail much at times so I don't blame them, but even when things do happen.. I get ignored half the time and it's difficult to do my job. I get no respect and people expect me to do things that are very far from my job description or may go against what I am supposed to do. I've only been in this position for a short period of time, but most people assume that I don't know anything regardless of the jobs I have held in the past and my performance while in those position WITHIN the company. I get caught up between department conflicts on what I should do so I get the short end of the stick regardless of what decision I end up making. The work that I do on the second part of my job is more productive and my own department is nice and I feel like I'm doing actual work, but no one else cares or knows even if it directly effects them. I didn't ask for this position/job.. just because certain people like to be paid to sit around, not do too much for the first half of the job and be treated like dirt doesn't mean that everyone else does. I'm an ambitious person and this job makes me miserable. Work life balance is terrible especially in the bigger hubs. Full time supervisors and above are expected to work 10-12 hours a day throughout the year. Peak season is something else entirely. Senior management has the same issue where they do a lot of demanding, but they don't care to understand the intricacies of how things actually work and the root of the issues. You aren't allowed to take sick days. If you take one for whatever reason... people will talk behind your back in regards to it no matter the reason why. Many people have been here for a while so they don't know anything else. They don't know that certain things aren't supposed to be the way it is here and they try to force it upon newer people to convince them that it's the norm and that they mind as well just give up on life if otherwise.
