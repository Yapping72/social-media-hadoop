This obviously depends on your options. If your one of those people with no degree or no luck finding a job with your degree there are many who became a drivers after working pre-load.\r\nThing is who knows how long it\u2019s takes to go from being a pre-loader to being a driver. One of my co-workers has been waiting over two years. My guess is it takes about five because it doesn't look like he\u2019ll be a driver anytime soon.

The training is like HELL week in a boot camp and you learn most of what you need on the job is you manage to pass. DOG BITES are a very real danger. when its hot, its HOTT we have no A/C and the trucks get like sweat boxes and when its cold it is COLD. No insulation in the trucks at all. We get rained on alot and work never stops. When it gets darks fast due to time changes we have to work extra hours in the dark looking for addresses which really sucks when people dont have visible addresses posted. You have to decide if its the right house by the neighbors address or take it back to the facility as a non deliver which means they are just going to put it back on your truck tomorrow and then your going to have to answer to the boss on why you brought it back! if you do deliver it and it ends up being the wrong address, your going to get yelled at anyways for a misdeliver and the customer complaining that they didn't receive their package. your job is to deliver every package they shove into your truck every morning. If you are lucky enough to finish your deliveries early, you don't get to go home to your family. You have to help the next smuck whos been goofing off all day catch up on his deliveries. They don't admit it out loud but they pressure you to work through your breaks. They hate replacing uniforms and want you to wear yours until it literally has holes.

Also, the pay is top notch for anyone, especially when you don\u2019t have to have any post-secondary education to work there, yet they will pay for you to do any education after only a few months!
