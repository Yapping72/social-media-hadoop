So TLA is for show. \r\nHR also failed in computing employees' annual pro-rated leave- even primary school students can do better than them.\r\nTurnover rate is very high among higher management and non management. Many political moves are made under the table. Non management job hop because of low pay. Higher management had to tender their resignation because of back stabbing. Most of the local higher managements resigned and were replaced by foreigners. \r\nUPS gives very low salary compared to their peers. A supervisor earns about 3k. Bonus payout is 0.4 month and Annual increment is about 3%\r\nRecently the company is struggling but they still set up a special team to 'interview' each and every employee on their job scope - wasting resources.\r\nThey also set up a special team to negotiate in buying over TNT but the negotiation didn't went through because of European union's law. How can the specialized team didn't thoroughly do their homework on the legal process on merging? The loss in negotiation results in a few hundred million loss - means smaller bonus for employee"}, {"review_title": "Good people, good vibes.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Finance Analyst in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Wonderful colleagues with positive vibes.\r\n- Many young people around.\r\n- Compensated for overtime.", "cons": "- Isolated area with limited nearby amenities.\r\n- Repetitive work."}, {"review_title": "Old and backdated freight/logistics company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "10 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Officer in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good working colleagues and great benefits", "cons": "Biased HR and senior management"}], [{"review_title": "great", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Jul 2020", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "endless opportunities.

These big-wig billionaires have the audacity to sit there talking about financial inequality and how it can be fixed, but they conveniently don't bother to recognize the fact that it's companies are GREEDY and not paying people more when they can very easily afford to.

He was back in 2 days thanks to the union. -A lot of the time, it really is like getting paid to work out. Not the easiest work, but it's not an awful step into being more active (I've been losing weight pretty consistently).", "cons": "-Upper management. If this were a month or two into my tenure, I'd put this in the Pros section. The original \"head\" manager was really cool and I liked him. He left and got \"temporarily\" replaced with a suit, and he's been changing things left right and center. Making metro work in load every night during seasonal was a pretty bold and dumb move on his part (and the reason why someone got \"fired\"). He's also gotten other suits involved like an \"efficiency expert\" who I'm sure knows what he's doing on paper, but his suggestions will probably drop worker happiness. Can't have multiple people per truck (so we talk to each other less) and insists we use rollers (which are pretty good until the belt stops, then they're literally the worst). It's just cramping the otherwise chill vibe. -Pay. Starts at $15.50. Amazon'll kick your butt in their warehouse, but at least you'll be making $17 for your troubles. -Non-seasonal hours are laughable. Outside of seasonal, it's almost impossible to make a living off of this job alone. Either you work 2 jobs, or just quit and get a job that works you 5-8 hours per day consistently. As we wrap up seasonal, you can expect 3-4 hour days, and 20 hours MAX per week. If you're lucky. Or you can work 6 days and guarantee 20 hours, but then you're working 6 days in a physically demanding job. -High turnover. I've personally seen at least 10 faces come and go during a 2 month stretch in seasonal, and apparently there's been more people I don't know about who've quit. If UPS could keep people, then the job would be dummy easy and we wouldn't feel like we're understaffed almost all the time. -Benefits. UPS totes some of the best benefits for a part-time employer. They also tote the longest probation period for said benefits I've ever heard. You have to work here 9 months in order to get access to your benefits. Considering the pay + hours scenario, I doubt a lot of people get the benefits.

Everything from the hire process to collecting your pay when the hours are off. It\u2019s almost unbelievable what I experienced as a 22.4. It's important to know the difference between a RPCD and a 22.4. The 22.4 position was created to be a hybrid inside/driver position but instead became a way for UPS to just have cheaper delivery drivers. You don't have the same overtime protection as the RPCDs so they work you like a dog and the pay is lower for doing the same work. It\u2019s not the company you want to be apart of.  UPS was private until 99. Ask any old timer and they will tell you thats when it was good.  At UPS the management which are \u201cemployees of UPS\u201d and everyone else who is union (inside warehouse workers and drivers). UPS management are not union. You have two forces working side by side. The union workers just want to do a fair days work for a fair days pay and go home. The union workers are great. Never met anyone I didn\u2019t like. The management at least at the center I work at I reserve judgment because there under pressure to meet numbers but I witness shady behavior many times when I was there from lying on my packet to trainers teaching the methods but not applying the methods to cut time to show the route can be done at \"said\" time. If management wants you out they will play games. Numerous times my diad would malfunction. I was told one time to just use your cell phone!? After working for sometime I was told I needed to fill out another application because there system had me coded in a different position.  Expect long hours and a bricked out truck. A big red flag was when drivers are expected to show up early off the clock to organize there trucks. Technically thats the the pre loaders job but since they're constantly quitting or being understaffed it falls on your shoulders. Whats sad is people do work off the clock because they just want to make there day smoother. You are monitored the whole work day via telematics.  Every stop is recorded and you have to follow in order ignition, handbrake, pull in left mirror seat belt and bulk head door grab package, close door and repeat. If you waiver on this the telematics will report. Management secretly will following you to see if you\u2019re following the methods. Sometime you catch them and blow there cover lol.  Finding addresses in complete darkness I found very challenging.  Peeing in a bottle 5 to 10 times a day is absurd but everyone does it. Having equipment failures from Diad (hand held computer)malfunctions to bulkhead door fob not working and Orion zig zagging across you route in a way that doesn't seem the most efficient. My biggest challenge was the multiple high rise's apartment complexes I had that are a nightmare especially when there are no package lockers or you cant get access to the building and you have 200 plus stops and 1 stop might have 60 plus separate packages over 10 floors with oversized items and daylight is running out with residential stops left to complete. The sun is your best friend. As soon as the sun sets it\u2019s a whole different animal. You will have a flash light and headlamp to add in the steps of each stop. Unfortunately in todays job market people are desperate for decent paying jobs so UPS is hiring constantly and it becomes a meat grinder of new hires willing to  give it a go. If it was great UPS wouldn\u2019t have a revolving door like they do.  All that being said I think it really depends on the city and the UPS center you are working at. If you\u2019re not young I would not bother and if you\u2019re young the stress and physical  repetitive work  overtime will have you feeling old. What good are benefits if you cant see your family and what good is a pension if your body is too busted up and cant enjoy retirement.  In my opinion based on my experience the juice isn\u2019t worth the squeeze.  I did witness some amazing talented drivers who make the work look easy. It's not for everyone.
