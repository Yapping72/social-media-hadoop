The job of loading/Unloading but specifically the job of sorting is physically demanding. Don't believe anything they tell you. It is physically taxing on your upper body. Training and the job itself is not difficult. You have to memorize coding for sorting of packages and will take a bit to memorize but through the repetition you can memorize fairly quickly. What really makes the task of sorting is the mismanagement of the unloaders, who are not monitored properly, other than to move packages faster off the trailer regardless and consideration of the person on the other end trying to sort packages to the correct sorting belt. When you have packages that could way up to 70 lbs, and not just 1 package many times, it opens you up to unsafely moving packages in front of you, to behind you. When you get tired the injuries will come for lack of proper pace and concern for safety. Due to these and other bad training practices, I am surprised that I didn't hear of many injuries while my short stint there, but would not be surprised if the truth came out that there are more than I know or knew about. You will hear them talk a real good game about concern for safety and there practices, but there is a real lack of actually practice of safety.\r\nMy employment was to short know if the union was any good. I believe in Unions, but in my only interaction with them and paying union dues in my short stint, it was not worth it. Maybe because I was employed as part-time and such a short time, but you figure if you pay into the dues, the process to help would be a lot better to help in solving and making sure that hiring processes are honest and with integrity, regardless of employment status or length.

It's great when they have a lot of package handlers to help when we get slammed, so we're not overwhelmed. You get 2 weeks of paid leave after a year and three weeks after 2 years. The schedule is flexible enough that management will give extra time off with enough notice.

It's a union job, so right now most of us get the same pay (union contract dictates the pay) and there are some who do as little as possible. That means if you are killing it, then you will also be doing the work others should be able to do. Supervisors are not part of the union and should not be doing union work. They're not even suppose to touch packages, except in training new hires or when short staffed. They're supposed to make every effort to be staffed with union members. One time, union reps came to our facility, and the supervisors wouldn't dare even touch a box in fear that the union reps would see them. They are not part of the \"bargaining unit\". Everything is dictated in the contract that the union negotiates with the company. If you say anything to them about this, they will target you because you can get compensated for the work they did and took from you. I believe it's 3x the amount that you would have been paid. You do this by timing them when they do union work. It becomes stressful when you do grieve. They'll eventually leave you alone the more you grieve them because it stresses them also.

This is contrary to your training (if you get trained) where they tell you that supervisors are not supposed to touch boxes. \r\n\r\nThere's a lot of competition between you and other supervisors in other areas of the HUB you work at. Also, very confrontational. If you're doing something wrong you'll know. In team meetings they go over the previous days results and most full-time supervisors openly shame you and call you out for not meeting expectations or worse the full timers own expectations. \r\n\r\nAlso, the people who work for you will probably not like you at first for whatever reason. If they do then that's great. But, when I became a supervisor I almost got into two fist fights with loaders in the first week. You have to follow protocol confidently because some loaders will actively try to get you fired, and you defeat them by just knowing the UPS protocols as well, if not better, than they do. It took me about a year for the loaders to finally respect me. You earn their respect by holding them accountable, being kind, and by being a leader.\r\n\r\nYou are not their friend you are their boss. Don't be a dictator, but be a leader.\r\n\r\nYou might have to break up fist fights between loaders who don't like each other. \r\n\r\nPeople quit constantly. It's rare that you have to fire anyone. It makes you believe that people are inherently not dependable, liars, and selfish. This job will prove that true, but it makes you appreciate the ones who are consistent and dependable that much more even if they don't like you. \r\n\r\nYou will be working with people who don't have much education, and if you \"talk smart\" than they feel like you're talking down to them even though your not. This goes for management as well. I know full-time supervisors who never went to college and barely graduated high school. I'm not saying this makes them bad people or unqualified, but this is still a blue collar job. You're not working with people who all have engineering degrees your working with a lot different types of backgrounds. And at my particular HUB there's only one person who in my area who went to college, and they're a current college student.\r\n\r\nIf you don't speak Spanish it can be hard, but google translate is a beautiful thing.\r\n\r\nYou will have to write everything out like a lawyer, but everyone uses super vulgar language regardless of who's present. I didn't curse that much before this job, but now I could be a character in a Scorsese film and I have to actively stop myself from cursing and I find it weird when people don't curse.\r\n\r\nYou will live by the moto \"Hope for the best.

Trucks are overloaded at hub in very disorganized manner with no room to sort pkgs in stop order. (Loaders don\u2019t seem to care, but maybe they are pressured to just get trucks loaded?) PVDs often end up helping drivers to sort outside trucks in rain and poor weather. Lots of waiting. Must be very flexible to work with various truck drivers who think they have the best way to do things\u2026but every one of them make errors on PVD manifests. It is in the PVD\u2019s best personal interest to ensure that their own vehicle has pkgs loaded in stop order so they can find anything as needed and to not waste delivery time looking for missing pkgs or having to revisit an address later with a \u201cfound\u201d pkg while under pressure to deliver quota number of pkgs and higher\u2026so others don\u2019t have to deliver your quota late at night to finish. Do not expect more than part-time hours, with occasional opportunities for overtime. (Weekly pay deposits have been $500-1300).
