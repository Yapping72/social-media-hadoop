The bad news is that they tried to short me on hours worked by not counting them and they flat out didn't pay me at all at first.As I mentioned,I only worked for two weeks.I got paid (or at least I was supposed to get paid) every week on Thursday.The second week came by and I told my supervisor I haven't got paid yet and asked when I would receive my money.He said Thursday.Thursday came and went and I didn't get paid on the second week.I finally did get paid the next Wednesday for the second week but not for the first.When I did get paid for the second week I was shorted by a couple of hours which leads to my next horror story. -Less hours:They will try to undercount the hours you worked.A half hour here,a half hour there.A quarter hour here,a quarter hour there.Hell,I've had an hour uncounted here and there.For example,if I worked from 10:00AM-4:30PM they would count it as 10:00AM-4:00PM.At the rate of $15 an hour it really adds up.Even a quarter hour here and there can really add up.$3.75 for a quarter hour here and there that's quite a bit of money you're losing that you worked for so can $7.50 here and there for a half hour.I guess they thought that if it was only a quarter hour here and there that I wouldn't notice or that I wouldn't care.Yeah,right! I told my supervisor about the hours not being counted.It was corrected in the first week but not in the second week.I didn't receive my first week check in 2020. January 2021 came around and I still haven't got paid for my first week or for the hours uncounted.I called my supervisor about this.He didn't pick up so I left him a message and told him to call me back.I did this on more than one occasion.When he didn't call back I decided to see him in person.He wasn't there when I stopped by the first two times.So I called Human Resources which sounded like it's been outsourced to India.They were hard to understand but did attempt to contact Management.After that went nowhere I decided to see my supervisor in person again in Spring 2021.This time I was able to see him and talk to him face to face.I let him know that I hadn't been paid yet and demanded the money I was owed;all of it.He said he would contact payroll and that I would get paid in 2 weeks.So guess what happened?Yep,you guessed it.If you guessed that I received my pay within 2 weeks then you guessed WRONG.I didn't get paid.Not for the first week or the hours uncounted. -Summer 2021:I received a document from UPS which started my next round of calls to HR and my chain of command.When that proved futile because of the outdated contacts available if not being ignored outright,I spoke with an attorney in the Fall of 2021 who suggested that I file a claim with the NYS Department of Labor. In the winter of 2022,after filing my case with the NYS DOL,I finally received a call from someone at UPS (Gee,I wonder why they called) and I told them that I hadn't been paid yet.They said they would mail me my two checks;one for the hours uncounted and another for the first week of work.And 7 weeks later,I got the two checks.This is what I had to go through to get paid the money I earned. This is my horror story.Don't let it be yours!Don't apply to UPS!You've been warned! If you do work for UPS,I recommend that you record everything.Any of your conversations with your chain of command (Supervisors,Managers,etc.) through text messages,any E-mails you have or oral conversations if you can.Screenshot your text messages,E-mails,time cards.Make hard copies of them too.Keep a log of your hours worked in a journal.If you think you're being too paranoid,you are not!"}], [{"review_title": "Good position", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Part Time Package Handler in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Job is easy and straight forward", "cons": "A lot of turn over"}, {"review_title": "The money isn't worth the conditions", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Package Handler", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people you work with make the job go by much faster.

They will pay for you to get your CDL certification if you want to become a long haul driver. You get paid weekly. The union is very helpful and will protect you from managers among other things. The insurance is great. Package drivers can make upwards of $40 dollars per hour after you stay for 2 years. Base pay (at the time of me writing) is $26 an hour.

During the middle of summer, the trucks can get upward of 100 degrees inside. All there is to cool you off is a little fan, which hasn't been cleaned of dust and debris, that blows around hot air and never reaches the back of the truck that you have to work in. They have an expectation that you should move at high speeds at all times. Sometimes they put you in a sixty foot truck with almost irregular packages (packages that are over 6' tall or over 70 lbs) and expect for you to be done with it in about an hour or so. Since the work day is so small, the pay is miniscule to the point that in order for you to get a decently sized check ($630-$700) you have to work doubles every day and run yourself into the ground. A normal check, after taking into account taxes and union fees, is about $230 a week. Also if you do make the decision to become a package driver (Driving the brown trucks) there is alot of money to be made but you have to put your safety and your well being at risk in order for you to do it. Those trucks you drive have no AC or Heating and you run on a very tight schedule.
