Few weeks in, at our 3rd or 4th team meeting, one of the managers told all Asians to go sit in a corner.  I was told he was joking and my supervisor advised me to report it to HR.  Because I was inexperienced (work & life), benevolent, and only two months with the company,  I didn't want to blemish a ten-year tenure.  Little did I know that there was a historical pattern of discrimination and racial insensitivity at the company.  Before I left, I found that the director (retiring) had a slew of racially-based complaints against him.  There was also a time in the past where UPS saw a trend of Asians leaving the company.  HR executives coined this phenomena as the \"Asian Exodus\".\r\n\r\nThe whole ordeal was very depressing to go through.

Don't go management its an eat or be eaten mentality and you will constantly have other management people taking your credit and blaming you for their mistakes. The word is cover your ass or someone will stick it to you. They will chew you up and spit you out because your nothing to them. The junior management has no power to do their job , the union is very strong so unless you steal something its almost impossible to fire a bad employee. If you pass out or collapse they will work around you and not offer any assistance or let anyone help you just call an ambulance and leave you were you fall. They are afraid of any liability even though there is a good Samaritan law that would cover you.  Very hard work for the money you make and lousy hours for years.

Each week my check has been about $125 when I was expecting $300 based on the hours we all applied for and on top of this little pay of $125 they deduct $25 for union fees. Each week mgmt promised the hours would pick up. I was considered a hard worker so they awarded me with a small gift my second week there. The next week I was told that they were promoting me to supervisor which would give me more hours and more money. Two days later they hired another supervisor with no explanation to me. The next day I called out and when I returned the following day the new supervisor set me up in my station and then the manager said \"oh you called out yesterday, well we really dont need you today so you can leave\". This is RETALIATION for me calling out one day. UPS I'm disappointed you allow managers to take advantage of those trying to get their feet on the ground and work hard for you. I guess Warehouse employees are meaningfulness. Turnover rate is high because of false advertising of hours. Why stay to risk our lives to COVID for 2 hours a day when we were sold on 25+ per week.

Due to their low pay, many people in the area work for other companies doing similar jobs for better pay which leaves UPS understaffed for most of the year. Because of this, supervisors are expected to fill in for the lack in staffing even though it is against union regulations. Upper management seems oblivious to the bad conditions and does little to address it. I felt very under appreciated throughout my time at UPS.
