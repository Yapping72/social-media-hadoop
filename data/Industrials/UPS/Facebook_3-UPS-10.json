Based on what I have seen and heard I think full time employees and drivers (both CDL and non) are well taken care of and have access to a different experience.", "cons": "In order to get payroll issues addressed I have asked two different managers for a contact in HR. Both managers said the exact same thing to the word, \"There is no HR.\" This is a $137 billion dollar company that employs several hundred people in the location where I work. There is no HR?\r\n\r\nThe internal company website says that it takes 4-6 weeks to setup direct deposit. If you become an employee make sure you sign up for direct deposit when you hire on. I made a mistake in my routing number and have been trying to get set up for direct deposit for 6 months. I last applied before Halloween and still do not have direct deposit set up, and next week is March. The reason this is important is that UPS does not mail your paycheck to you. My paper paychecks are routinely not delivered. When I inquire about my paychecks the managers have patiently explained on multiple occasions that there are literally thousands and thousands of paper pay stubs in the office and there is no way to know which are actual paychecks and which are just the paper stub from direct deposits. What beggars the imagination is trying to understand how UPS balances their books if they don't know who has and who hasn't been paid and how many thousands of dollars worth of lost paychecks are just sitting in an office? \r\n\r\nFor the daily work environment it will be critical that you self-manage. You will need to track your hours, as it is quite common to have payroll issues due to incorrect time cards. Everyone I work with, who has tracked their hours, has received an incorrect timecard and consequently incorrect pay. You will also need to be able to work extended periods without a break. We routinely work 6-8 hours with one 10-minute break. You can expect boxes and packages to fall on you, to fall on the floor, and that you will be asked to load or unload trucks by yourself. Since it is a unionized operation and seniority based, you need to understand there is little, if any, correlation between pay and performance. Hard working employees will not be rewarded and employees who don't work hard and don't care will not be punished. It is reasonable to expect that the harder you work, the greater the likelihood that you will be paired with someone who doesn't work so that you can carry them. \r\n\r\nThe managers are doing their best, but there is only so much they can do. I have seen multiple managers work to help out when we get behind and attempt to show employees the right way to do things. Their heart is in the right place, but the package volumes are far above what can be reasonably handled and we are too short staffed (with people who work) in order to be able to keep up. In fairness to UPS, the facility is a number of years old and was not designed to handle the volume generated by both COVID and a post-Amazon world where everyone has everything shipped to their home.\r\n\r\nIt is important to point out that because I am part time I do not work at the facility during regular business hours, so perhaps things are better or smoother for regular 8-5 employees."}, {"review_title": "they are a horrible company", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "2 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Solutions Specialist in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "none, there are none here, they lead by nothing but idiots.", "cons": "They screw over everyone just to make a profit on their ridiculously over priced service."}, {"review_title": "Great job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 May 2021", "job_title": "Training Supervisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great job flexible schedule !", "cons": "Physical , some people expect it to be laid back but it\u2019s physical which isn\u2019t too much of a big deal"}, {"review_title": "Employee growth is very slow in developing countries", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "23 May 2021", "job_title": "Manager in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great brand.

Typically a shift won't last more than five hours at most, but as I'll describe in the cons section this is subject to change because of a few things. Another small benefit of the work is that you'll be on four feet and moving constantly during the shift, so you'll get some exercise.", "cons": "One of the biggest drawbacks to working at UPS as a package handler is that you'll be kept unaware of the background information in terms of how many packages are to be sorted, and the changes that might be made to your workplace. Granted, in many cases the supervisors are also kept in the dark, but generally you'll rarely know what your workload is like until after you've already sorted it all. Your supervisor is your anchor while working at a UPS warehouse If you have a good supervisor who knows how to manage their workers effectively and adapt to the changing situations, you'll be fine, and most likely you'll have a relatively decent work experience. However, supervisors who aren't as proficient with their management skill or communication skills will detract from productivity and worker morale quite heavily. When UPS head offices enact changes you don't have any say in what goes on as long as it doesn't interfere with anything too important to the local union. The union from my own experience was a serious mixed bag. There was some form of job security as long as you do your job adequately enough, but this also means that personnel who are disagreeable or barely contribute to getting the work done are an element you'll have to deal with. You won't receive any benefits from the union such as health/etc until you've worked there for a full year, but during that time when you don't have that benefit you'll still be paying a small portion of your first paycheck each month toward the union."}, {"review_title": "Great Comapany!!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 May 2021", "job_title": "Applications Developer in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company culture, respect, great team work", "cons": "Compensation i think is low if compare with the competency"}, {"review_title": "Good pay and benefits, but that\u2019s about it", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Delivery Driver in Pittsburgh, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay is good and so is the healthcare after your minimum days of working.", "cons": "Management is a mess.
