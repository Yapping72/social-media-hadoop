With loading, requires you to scan each package that comes off the belt, mark the number of the location for the driver to see and then you will need to allocate each package to its truck, each package on the truck has to be put in numerical order and stacked to their standard. You are really in a race against time because the packages do NOT stop until the end of your shift. You will almost need to run from your truck back to the belt to make sure you grab your packages for your truck which can be very stressful keeping in mind all the steps you must take before moving out of your truck.\nMost of the time the air vents do not work so you will need to constantly refill for water, remember the belt NEVER stops moving, so a 2 minute walk and push your belt back by 20 boxes that you have to sort through while others are still coming down. The managers are very rude and unprofessional most of the time, because most of them only know UPS and have no understanding that no one is their maid/butler and will talk down to you. You will receive no help until the drivers come in and at times they don't always show up on time so you are literally struggling your entire shift.\nYou do not get much training because the managers are always \"busy\" doing what seems like nothing. \nYou will need to be there everyday prior to your clock in times because they will literally lock the doors and tell you they are not accepting anymore people-- if you are late and you manage to get in before the doors are locked, they will literally pull you from your belt and tell you to clock out.\nEach day the workload is different, but Wednesdays is their busiest day and at times you can be working with over 60,000 boxes that will be divided amongst the other trucks, typically each truck will receive about 200-400 boxes, keep in mind you never have just one truck to load, so if you are not a fast worker, they will rush you and you will be stressed out your entire shift, just by the end of it to not even receive a thank you..

They are reliable and the business is generally solid and resistant to economic instability. Basically, it's a (small) paycheck.", "cons": "I was temporarily furloughed from my airline job during the COVID-19 pandemic, and I expected that as a large transportation company working at UPS would be similar to the airline. I was wrong, and was very disappointed with my experience. (Disclaimer: I worked in a \"small package center\", not in the airline division of UPS. The airline operation may be better.)\r\n\r\nI found that most employees at UPS very much did not want to be there, and it dragged down the entire culture. My immediate supervisor was miserable and generally wanted to be left alone. Full time supervisors in my building were expected to work 12-16 hours a day, 6 days a week. Due to the massive amounts of burn out everyone was generally in a bad mood and not tolerating of even minor mistakes. The upper management degraded and berated the supervisors on a daily basis. I literally saw a full-time supervisor go home crying after a meeting with the building/regional manager.\r\n\r\nI was never trained to dispatch properly because it consisted solely of on-the-job training with my burnt out supervisor. We generally started work around 2330-midnight making the dispatch plan, but we only had until 1 or 2am to complete it before the system reset. This left us with 2.5 hours at best to complete the plan for almost 90 routes. My supervisor had been with UPS for over 20 years, and he was white knuckling it to get the job done in time without training me. There were a few times that he did try to train me, but considering I was brand new to the job I really had no idea what I was doing and we did not make timely progress. We could have come in earlier to spend more time training, but he still would have been expected to stay until at least noon and then come in again that night. Work life balance for is non-existent for full-time employees at UPS.\r\n\r\nI also saw multiple part-time supervisors who wanted to be promoted get strung along for long periods of time. The woman who I replaced had been with UPS for 4 years, and was promised that she would be getting promoted to the be the Assistant (to the) Regional Manager. This never happened, and she was stuck on the box line where most the new supervisors start. When she saw that they were not going to give her the job they originally promised she started to train to become a driver. After a month of driving routes she was denied the permanent job, and had to go back to the part-time supervisor job on the box line. This was the last straw for her, and she left the company after nearly 5 years. She was an excellent employee and one of the few who kept a positive attitude despite the culture there. I am glad she got out, but it's a shame UPS treated her this way.\r\n\r\nI was so fed up with working at UPS I actually put in my resignation prior to having a new job offer in hand. I figured that I'd rather be unemployed than continue to go into such a horrible work environment, and with peak coming I saw the writing on the wall that it would only get worse."}], [{"review_title": "Inside Sales", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good paid.
