Making it almost impossible to satisfy management because either you work safe, or fast.\r\n\r\n-There is literally no incentive to work hard. At UPS there are 2 types of drivers, guys who want OT and guys who wanna go the **** home. The guys who want the OT, work at a safe and slower pace. They cannot be fired for poor performance, so they don't care how long it takes to complete a route. I'm one of the guys who wanna go home, I work at a nice pace, and try my best to achieve their ridiculous time expectations, I usually finish my route(depending on the route) by 6:00 just enough for me to get home by 7. LOL. If you work hard and finish early, they reward you by making you go and take 20 stops off of a driver who works slower. This leads to the moral of the story. There is no incentive to work hard. If you work slow, you cant get fired, and you get overtime. If you work hard, you do more stops, then get told to go and help a slow driver. So you and the slow driver finish at the same exact time, but they just did 50 less stops than you. This company uses you and does not care about you.\r\n\r\n-Starting pay is 20.50 an hour. This may sound decent, but when you realize how much work and stress you have every day, this is far from fair.\r\n\r\n-Parking the trucks\r\n\r\n-Working on Saturdays\r\n\r\n-Literally no diversity, everyone here is white and miserable\r\n\r\n-Probably a whole lot more\r\n\r\n-So simply put, If you are single and are looking to spend most of your day working, this is a job for you. If you have a family, want to make it to the baseball games, be home for dinner, go to the gym, or do literally anything other than work. Trust me, and continue your job search else where."}, {"review_title": "Miserable", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Part Time Package Handler", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not much besides the good insurance.", "cons": "Winters and summer sucked.

I never leave reviews because I am appreciative of most companies and understand that no company is perfect but UPS is so horrible that I felt motivated to vent via \"Glassdoor\", hoping some of my issues will eventually be fixed within the corporation. First and foremost, this company rushes training and sends you to work on the first day. Training consisted of watching an hour-long video that taught you the bare minimum. It didn't even touch on the proper lifting form or teach us how to view our paystub and get into contact with HR if we had any questions. They had us take a test too and didn't even discuss the right answers to the 10-page long packet. Additionally, this company chose to decrease our pay rate randomly even though we're going through inflation. Why decrease our pay rate when you're charging your customer more. Seems kind of greedy and unreasonable in this economy. Lastly, this job does not care about your safety or health! Yes, I understand they give you great health insurance..., but this isn't received until months after you do tons of literally back-breaking work. Let's also talk about the trucks filled with heavy items (over 90lbs) that you're forced to do alone. To make matters worst, these trucks are packed to the roof so you have to risk one of these heavy items collapsing on your head. One of the workers actually got a concussion from these heavy items falling on his head.
