Certainly, after completing my background check and other required documentation, everything went downhill. I\u2019m going to explain exactly what happened from my experience so far:\r\n - Before orientation, I never received a protocol from either HR or my manager, as to where I needed to report to on my first day for orientation. Since I relocated and stayed in temporary housing, I assumed that either HR or my manager would email me directions and time to arrive at the facility.\r\n - After my first day, IT setup my laptop/computer/equipment, however, one of the IT support reps misplaced them somewhere most likely in the wrong cubicle (have absolutely no idea how that happened). As a result, I received them a few days later (unbelievable).\r\n - For the first couple weeks, I did the new employee tasks, but on top of that, I was expected to do tons of reading documentation that was difficult for me to absorb. Basically, one day, my manager came over to my cubicle to check up on me. My manager looked to see what I was reading to ensure I was reading the right material. They wanted to see if they could make it any easier for me. Based on the conversation, he could not make it any easier for me, as I started to become very stressed and burnt out. Juggling new employee tasks while reading a crazy load of documentation is unrealistic to absorb in a short amount of time.\r\n - Next, I went through some training for a system (not familiar with), but did not know it needed to be installed on my computer, as I was not told ahead of time. If anything, my manager even admitted that it was their fault. Because of this, I was very behind with the training and couldn\u2019t even catch up to the other employees to learn and do the exercises during the class. As soon as I got it installed on my computer, I went through the exercises all on my own with ZERO help, as everyone was \u201ctoo busy\u201d to help out.\r\n - My actual first assignment/task did not occur until a few months later from my start date. The worse part was I got invited to a meeting that was not only short notice, but was assigned to only do my tasks with no training, guidance, coaching, and help and unrelated to what I learned from the training. \r\n\r\nOn The Job Training\r\n\r\n- There is little to no on the job training.\r\n- Seems to be that the expectation is to learn everything on your own. \r\n- That really loses not only my motivation to work, but also don\u2019t look forward to go to work. \r\n- I believe it has to do with the work not being interesting for me, as I already feel stressed and burnt out each and every day.\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\n- Does not provide sick days. Have to use PTO for sick days.\r\n- Medical is very expensive per paycheck.\r\n\r\nResources\r\n\r\n- My manager has no interest in assisting me as an employee. They only care about deadlines and customer satisfaction. Nothing else matters to them. \r\n- The team/coworkers involved in projects I am doing are not very friendly and are unwilling to help get me up to speed. \r\n- HR is not the best resource to go to for career opportunities. They referred me to talk to my manager, which isn\u2019t a great option either.\r\n\r\nOverall\r\n\r\n- Hope this gets better soon since it\u2019s been only a few months being employed at NG.\r\n- Would be very open to even possibly transferring to a different job at NG."}, {"review_title": "Fun but challenging", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Production Planner/Scheduler", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Always learning something new, everyday there is a new challenge", "cons": "Not your normal 9 to 5 if that matters to tou"}, {"review_title": "Great Work/Life Balance", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Program Planning Scheduling Analyst II in Roy, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "PTO comes easy, benefits are good, overall work/life balance is a great fit.", "cons": "Lots of 'hurry up and wait' happens, which can lead to inconsistent expectations."}, {"review_title": "Big Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Principal AI Software Engineer in Linthicum, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of opportunities\r\nGreat work life balance and flexibility\r\nLots of traveling opportunities", "cons": "Regular big company issues\r\nSecurity and travel forms"}, {"review_title": "Good company, good people", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Principal Systems Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for and great people!", "cons": "Need better processes to go through with HR and documents."}], [{"review_title": "NG Review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Principal Computer Systems Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Dynamic environment for IT personnel.

Not that impressive as Amazon has better deals and it doesn't drop the price that much. Just an added perk.\r\n\r\nLots of great things about the company. Work-life balance is by far the greatest. Working remotely, flex hours, and 9/80 fridays are a huge benefit.", "cons": "Lots of slow days - some days will be fast paced due to deadlines, however there are many slow days. As a high performer, this becomes discouraging and depressing. I almost always have to ask for work; sometimes I charge time for no work being done\r\n\r\nLess work for young employees - a lot of time, we're given menial work as younger engineers. It felt as though I didn't do much and I got a promotion, which felt weird. It seems like this was more of an attempt to keep me working for the company to combat their high attrition rate.\r\n\r\nQuality of workplace highly dependent on location - I work as a Pathways engineer. You get 3 rotations before deciding where you'd like to station yourself. My first rotation as a systems engineer was more of a secretary, as I managed file organization, offered tech support, and supported/maintained a completed engineering project. At my next rotation, I worked on data analysis and coding. Same title, wildly different responsibilities.\r\n\r\nPassive aggressive management - applies to above point; depends on location.\r\n\r\nLack of transparency upon entering Northrop Grumman as an employee\r\n\r\nMixed bag of employees - most are welcoming and friendly, however I have met quite a few who are prejudiced and judgemental. It has made me question my place in the company and industry as a whole.\r\n\r\nPaid Time Off (PTO): no sick days, but get paid time off, about 13 work days starting out (~100hrs). You can go negative if you're sick, but that means as you earn PTO hours, you're basically paying back a PTO debt. During covid-19, PTO can drop to -80 hours and then future accumulated PTO pays off this negative balance over time.\r\n\r\nUnstable industry - funding can turn off and then management scrambles to find you work. It can be very irritating having worked on something for a long time and then get interrupted for months at a time until program funding is available again. Recently, NG lost a contract and some people are looking for new jobs within NG.\r\n\r\nI have had mostly poor experiences here, and perhaps I feel disgruntled in writing this review. There is a reason NG has a high attrition rate, especially with younger engineers, so maybe then this review is justified. My coworkers and I occasionally vent to each other about how we are not very happy with how work is going. I'm one person, so make sure to read other reviews and take this with a grain of salt. \r\n\r\nThis could be a great fit for you, but just not for me. I don't do well in slow paced environments and need to feel responsible for more work than simple tasks. Understandably, junior engineers need a learning mindset and patience, but it seems ridiculous to me how little work I have for the salary I'm paid."}, {"review_title": "NG", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Operations Manager in Linthicum, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay and paid holidays", "cons": "corporate culture / intense pressure to meet deadline"}, {"review_title": "Overview", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Engineer in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance is ok", "cons": "Political to get promoted \nManagers move every few years which impedes career progression"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Systems Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Good culture\n-Good work life balance", "cons": "I have no cons to share"}, {"review_title": "Satisfactory", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Senior Mechanical Engineer in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Diverse work opportunities and career path progression.", "cons": "Strenuous working hours with sparse remuneration."}], [{"review_title": "Not bad, with room for imprevement", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "15 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Redondo Beach, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some long term stable programs.

Leaving employees who started their Masters/PHD programs with the peace of mind that they would be covered now scrambling to figure out how they're going to afford it all.

They'll come in with signing bonuses and perks they'd never give you as you're training them and holding their hand constantly because they don't know what they're doing. Perfect example, I had a role where I asked for a telework day since I lived pretty far and I was immediately denied and given the run around. A new employee joined our team a week later and had two telework days. I eventually called out my manager's hypocrisy as I was outperforming the new employee while commuting from another state while the new employee was local and I was granted a grand prize of 1 telework day (gee thanks, smh). If you're someone unwilling to pushback on things they will continue to push your limits to see how far it can go.\r\n\r\n-Applying to jobs internally is a joke, you have to know someone in order to get any role even if you're over qualified for the position.
