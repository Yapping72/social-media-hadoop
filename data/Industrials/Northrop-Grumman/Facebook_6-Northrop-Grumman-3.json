The irony is this has resulted in much younger, less experienced choices of replacements who are themselves very ill equipped to manage a diverse workforce.  They are struggling with their own jobs, particularly with the technical aspects of it as well as the finer points of genuine employee encouragement or measured discipline rather than the standard \"check boxes of managing people\" they get from various avenues of training.  In many cases they assign themselves prime technical work to learn from, while neglecting real incentives for the older more experienced folks who are left with no choice but to either work under them or quit.  They are selfish and they are not capable of communicating consistently or directly with their direct reports in meaningful ways.  And this was before COVID-19.  They do not incentivize them or form relationships with them, and they treat them as a means to an end, only.  The result is they tend to isolate their older reports rather than engage them.  In some cases, I have witnessed some management referring to older workers in general with derogatory language.  This has left an entire technically proven and capable group with an unmotivating, defunct career path, since there is not room for them to also continue to develop technically nor develop along the leadership path.   \r\n\r\nFunctional and Program Leadership is broken because there is not a strong relationship chain among leadership.  So even the capable leaders who do exist, particularly on programs, cannot function as such to their own direct reports because they cannot even trust their own leadership chain.  \r\n\r\nI know first hand of many folks over the age of 45 who are on anti-depressants or seeking personal counseling because of this prolonged way in which the company has been mistreating  them.  In the last few years, I know of at least one case, possibly two, where additional personal or family issues have pushed someone over the edge and resulted in the loss of job or life.

Not only is it complicated as to who actually helps you get promoted (hint no one but yourself), but the only constant is the goals that NG sets nationwide.\r\n- The work was disappointing. Obviously you can't discuss cleared work here, but I was led to believe my job would be much more interesting than it was.\r\n- Mentorship is laughable. Now I'm not expecting things to be handed to me, especially because Google is your friend. However, if I ask questions about something that I'm new on, I shouldn't be jumping to literally every cubicle on a team in an endless round of \"ask Bob\".\r\n- Benefits are lackluster. I honestly think they take advantage of people straight out of college by dangling big numbers and cool job titles, but your insurance terms are bad for the industry and got continually worse while I was there.\r\n- Office space is depressing and too small for the needs of the company. We had full-time employees sitting two to a cubicle because NG HQ never authorizes Xetron to rent new space. Every once in awhile an executive deigns to come out to the sticks to see us, but our continual pleas to just rent more space is always denied. At least the people leaving are helping that out for them, but it's a simple problem with a simple solution that shows how the bureaucracy of NG fails their people.\r\n- No emphasis on employee health during Covid-19. This is what drove me out. I had a family member symptomatic after coming in contact with it at their work and they still wouldn't let me out until I begged their medical staff in Baltimore.\r\n- Management is a good old boys club. They have their favorites who worked on contracts with them over 20 years and trust them implicitly. I've seen decisions and opinions take a complete 180 in the span of a month because of what someone on the inside is. You may aspire to grovel until you join them, but I'm telling you there's better out there.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I honestly believe Cincinnati is the location that Northrop Grumman forgot. Lack of office space, poor management, engineers dropping off poorly run projects left and right. All for \"mission\" work that turns out to be very different than what they tell you they work on. I want to believe NG outside of \"Central\", \"Ohio\", or whatever they call it now is better. The bread and circuses from popcorn, donuts, and the occasional scraps from lunch meetings isn't cutting it.

Did I say there was no career path?  I have heard many stories of very capable people being at the same grade for 10-15 years without seeing a promotion, and annual increases are very low.  They still use the antequated and morale-killing Totem method to determine raises, and if you don't know what that is, you don't want to know.  Management manages people from a distance--a long distance.  Awards given to boost morale are few, small, and virtually random, seldom connected to any real excellence.  Management response to concerns is typically in the form of rah-rah slogans, sayings, or cute remarks.  And it seems like every year they take away another benefit.

Another downside is that many departments are very politicized and many employees find themselves doing better work than a coworker, but are not rewarded or advancing as fast as they should be.
