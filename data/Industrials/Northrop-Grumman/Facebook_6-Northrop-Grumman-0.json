They will say there is the freedom to move around the organization, but you are now stuck in one business unit. The attrition rate is high at around 10%. The benefits are sub-par. The work can get dull, and you may work with bad people at times. You will find yourself nodding and smiling while disagreeing with others in the workplace. I cannot honestly recommend this place to anyone. Go work somewhere else where the bureaucracy is not going to stop you from growing. The new reorganization prevents growth! Let me re-emphasize that, there is NO growth for you now at NG. Basically, you will need to wait for someone to retire or die to get promoted. This will lead to a higher attrition rate. The sad part is that during all-hands meetings directors will lie to your face and tell you it is the greatest thing in the world. Don't believe them, employee surveys show that over 70% of employees distrust and don't like Sr. Leadership. That is because they only care about themselves. The work is mostly classified, and you will need to go in to work in closed areas all the time. These areas are dirty. Once you are in a classified job, you can't get out of it so you are stuck. This was an OK place to work, now is a place I cannot recommend. Wait for Sr. Leadership to reorganize again in 2 years, as this experiment of them to save money is just a ticking timebomb. I expect attrition to grow up into the teens, if not 20%. One more thing. Expect 3% raises while inflation runs at 8% for two years. Again, they don't really care about you! The only time they care is when you get hired. After that, you are stuck. You can do an awesome job, but only get a 3% raise. If you do excellent work, you will get 3.5%, if you are a top performer, then maybe a 4% raise. The company will complain that such is the labor rate, but we all know that is just a way for them to not pay their employees more money or adjust for the high cost of living. There is a bonus for a select few, but the large majority of employees will never see that bonus, although you will get a 1k bonus for sharing success.

The level of incompetence of the current management has brought shame on one of the most storied names in aviation and space history. Northrop is a conglomerate of many acquired companies whose legacy the management has systematically destroyed. The primary criteria for elevation into the upper ranks of leadership are whether you're buddies with the old boys network that is already there. They surround themselves with sycophants who tell them how wonderful and effective they are while meanwhile the company disappoints its customers every year with broken promises, broken deadlines, broken budgets and broken hardware. There are three kinds of people who work at Northrop Grumman: kids fresh out of college who don't know any better but learn quickly and leave within 12-24 months; people who aren't capable enough to get a job at a real aerospace company; and people who worked for decades at one of the legacy companies and are pretending they can't see the state into which the current company has fallen, or hoping that the evidence in front of their eyes is somehow wrong. Northrop Grumman is chock-full of textbook examples of how not to run a company. When problems are brought to the attention of upper management, they blame the messenger and ostracize them. So engineering quickly learns not to bring any problems to the attention of management, such that everything becomes a last-minute surprise even if it was known for years. Senior engineers and managers who have been around long enough effectively have \"tenure\" and are abrasive, rude, and demeaning to the younger engineers that they should be mentoring. The company is hemorrhaging any and all of its high quality talent to, well, everywhere else in the industry, where pay is higher, working conditions are less abusive, and achievements are associated with the people who made them, not their bosses' bosses' bosses' bosses who barely know what the program even is, but are happy to take credit for it in front of the CEO. Want to buy a part through supply chain? Good luck- it's so broken that you'll be doing 18 months of paperwork to buy a pencil. Need to hire someone? Get ready for a titanic argument with HR and engineering about whether they've been allocated enough budget to staff one person on a job that at any sane company would take give. Want to make an engineering change on something that's clearly broken? Get ready for an army of vested interests to fight you on it so they don't have to do any work or possibly be blamed for having made a mistake in the past. Promotions are made based on who can blame others for their own failings more effectively and offer more worship to upper management. Decisions are made in a vacuum based on gut feel by people with a track record of disastrous decision after disastrous decision. The culture is one of fear of provoking the attention or notice of upper management, lying about problems because those who tell the truth about them are punished, and having technically incompetent managers cram down irrational engineering solutions on their teams; with some luck, the next week they'll forget they told you to do that and you can move on with something that makes sense. Virtually all high-potentials leave the company as soon as they can find any better option. HR views all pulses as identical, so if a 35-year veteran or a super-sharp rising star leaves the company and is replaced with someone with two months of experience in ice cream cone engineering, it's marked as a win. Even better if you can hire two, because now you're growing the company. Trying to get promoted, if you want to play that game, is much like how you might imagine the mafia to operate: you must display absolute loyalty to the boss in the most theatrical fashion possible, obey their every whim, no matter how stupid or unethical, and if you ever dare to even think about leaving, even to another division of NG or another program within the same division, you're dead to them forever. On the other hand, the (all-white) \"made men\" who surround the bosses are able to dictate operating terms with an iron fist to a wide variety of programs in which they have little or (more often) absolutely no technical, managerial, financial, or business competence whatsoever. To the extent the company continues to win and execute business, it's due solely to a combination of luck and the small cadre of hard-working veterans who continue to labor, day-in and day-out, with no recognition, reward (financial or otherwise), or realistic hope of promotion, because they really care about delivering for the customer. This group is shrinking rapidly and will soon be gone. For everyone else, the toxic and abrasive culture of cronyism, abuse, incompetence, inertia, and below-market comp drives them out very quickly, unless they're so poor at their job that they literally can't find work anywhere else in the industry. If you're seeking a job in aerospace, look anywhere else."}, {"review_title": "Okay place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Healthcare Assistant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits are good and 401k match", "cons": "Advancement takes too long here"}, {"review_title": "NG review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance is good", "cons": "No career growth Options for long term."}, {"review_title": "Q", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Associate Business Management Analyst in Rolling Meadows, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people work for the company", "cons": "Building is outdated.

I make less than any person on my team, but we all have the same degree level and overall I have the most general experience. HR's reasoning is that my degree doesn't directly correlate to my job. So, though I've been working in IT in some facet for a decade, my co-worker who was recently hired, whose only other experience is fast food, makes over 20k more than I do.

They trick people into Engineering positions and you come out to work in Maryland and find out that your put into a test role. You cannot transfer out of the group! You work for really bad managers that manipalate you etc. It is a science how bad they manipalate the employees. I watched 28 of 30 people that hired into the group leave within first 18 months. You pretty much are locked into a no raise situation. You do all the work and the bad management will asign one of thier buddies to take over on last minute to get credit and bonus etc. If you try to transfer out of group the management will use \"Needs Of The Business\" rules to force you to stay etc. If you leave the company the group will keep you from working for many years. They will not close your clearance out at NGC. Then the individuals tasked with maintaining privacy  in clearance process  puts stuff in your background as it is not closed and of course this is accidental. Yep, I left and couple years after leaving the guy put stuff in my paperwork so that when other company individuals would call over he would display or say false information. These people would believe him and drop you like a rock. I know several people happy in the real engineering groups but be very afraid of the Systems Integration and Test Groups. Yeah, like day one when I started we had the fake reorg and the job I was hired went away etc. The group I worked for was double billing the government and openly encouraged you to look the other way or to get better raises and or bonus play thier games. I love to work and such and worked a lot of OT etc. Yet, if you took any classes or education , the manager treated you like you were not contributing. The group in Integration was made up of manager and executives children that had zero real engineering skills. Group was quite pitiful technically. I do know there were better groups but you could not leave the management group I got into.\r\n\r\nIf you use Northrops Open Door Process you are basically setting yourself up as the managers control the human resources individuals and the complaint just lets them know to start screwing you over.\r\n\r\nMany people told me I got shafted. I see them in the stores around the area and basically the person I worked for was known for this but becasue she was daughter of a judge that they needed to fight all the legal issues she gets away with it.\r\n\r\nI went to HR just to get away from a narcistic person but they would not allow me to get out of the group.   When I would try and work on other projects they would have some reason I had to come back to that one person.  \r\n\r\nSo I actually mentored three interns and had no inputs into thier reviews. They gave them glowing reviews as the work I mentored them was good work.    I desigined a whole subsystem, ordered all the equipment and built it using 3 interns.   Yes, get poor reviews so they can bascially keep you from no raises.  When you hire into the group. They calculate the years you will be there and divide that by the end salary and well you will get 1/2 percent raise every other year. Meanwhile the idiots that are all firends get huge pay boost and most of them did zero work. There were three people that were running businesses, doing sports coaching for thier kids during work hours.   \r\n\r\nThey lied about people working fom other groups so they could make the bench utilization completely filled to get bonuses. So they would always tell me to write in log books how people I never met helped me etc.    \r\n\r\nI found that once you signed your time card they would lock you out. Then they would charge extra hours for you so they could bill governmetn and also to back fill the lies  / story about bench utilization.\r\n\r\nThe management would set you up on a bad day to get some human resources notice on you to hold over you to justify no pay increases etc.\r\n\r\nHere is a kicker. I finally thought I had gotten out of the group.  I worked mega hours on proposals and POCs for a guy. Then come eval time I found out I still worked for the other witch.    Got a really bad eval as I did nothing for them.  \r\nSo got upset and left message saying \"How could you do something like this to me\". Well that was reason for the third raise not happening. Again, this group was pathetically dishonest.    You would think human resources would allow people to get away from toxic narcistic individuals. \r\n\r\nThen when you leave they laugh how they can keep you from working.    Be very careful taking a job.  Stay away from the Integration Managers ....

TA will turn you down for a job you qualify for to the tee for and then admit they don't have any technical experience to know whether or not someone qualifies for a technical position.\r\n\r\n You can be harassed and belittled by management and HR won't do anything to the manager even though HR claims they have multiple reports about the same manager doing the same thing to other people and broke company policy. Most jobs you apply for, the hiring managers waste potential candidates time (they have to at least interview 3 candidates) by pulling them in for an interview because 80% of the time, the position is filled by one of their friends or whoever sucked up the most to the hiring manager. \r\n\r\nManagement loves to make their friends managers who don't have any experience, which in return shows with how poorly things are ran here. You attend all hands meetings and listen to leadership blow smoke up everyone behinds telling everyone how great the company is (I would too if I got the ridiculous amount they get for bonuses). They like to talk about how there's so many opportunities and growth within the company when in fact that's a lie. \r\n\r\nHiring managers pull the ol bait and hook tactic to lure people to their team. They promise you the world and make the work and their team sound so great just to be the total opposite. You take annual survey's that always result in showing how terrible the work environment and management/leadership is. Not only does nothing change, but then they assign all of us peasants action items how management/leadership could be better. You guys got the poor rating/score not us, do your own action item! \r\n\r\nThe company wastes money by redesigning the company logo and changes the logo on all of their assets when instead that money could've been used for better bonuses for their employees. Seems like weekly people are leaving the company to go to competitor companies because they were offered better pay, PTO, and career opportunity.

Very outdated work culture and below average benefits. 9/80 is a joke, but most companies in this industry still believe it's some amazing work perk. The work can be very boring. Absolutely no motivation for improvements to outdated facilities or efficiency since no one else is available to compete for some of the programs. Consistenty try to find way to side track ITAR restrictions so that weapon systems can be sold to parties that are fighting US forces or allies. Most of the time is spend on doing outdated paperwork that adds no value. \r\n\r\nThe people that run these companies, like Northrop Grumman, have never worked anywhere else so they are consistently confused why employees are leaving. Similar companies offer exteremely better benefits with significantly better work culture. I didn't even get a shirt when I started. On-boarding with Northrop was one of the worst I have had with any company.\r\n\r\nI was on a team with 15+ engineers. In the two years not a single person got a promotion.
