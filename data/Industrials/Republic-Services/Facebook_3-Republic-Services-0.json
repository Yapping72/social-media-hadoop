Management will blame every bad call on you instead of the customer who is calling in being abusive. If you get a bad survey score from a customer or the customer issues a complaint it is always your fault even if the customer is doing it maliciously. They say we need to help the customer better yet the company severely limits what we can do to help the customer.\r\n\r\nIf a customer demands a supervisor and we transfer to the Relationship Desk so they can speak with one then we get flagged for \"work avoidance\". We're told we're supposed to deescalate and handle that, but we aren't paid to do that. That's what the RD is for but it's bad if we transfer. If we issue credits they'll flag us for issuing too many credits but if we don't issue a credit and the customer complains then we're at fault.\r\n\r\nYou will not get any holidays off unless you use your PTO and you won't get that because they never approve PTO. You will almost always be denied and if you don't take your PTO then you lose it. Management took away holidays claiming it was based off of employee feedback yet literally no employee asked for it. It's a thinly veiled justification for not paying out PTO since we never get approved for it off and we lose it. \r\n\r\nThe pay is slightly better than most other call centers but for the amount of abuse and the call volume makes it nowhere near enough compensation. Call volume is sometimes so high customers are waiting for an hour and the first thing they do is yell at the innocent agent taking the call. Republic Services absolutely refuses to hire enough people and the call volume is all our fault despite the fact these customers are calling in solely because Republic Services did not service them.\r\n\r\nManagement tries to make it sound like they aren't blaming us by periodically holding raffles for prizes. These raffles are for all the agents so your likelihood to win anything is extremely low and most of the prizes are a \"ride-along in a garbage truck\". No one wants that. We want more money for the abuse we have to take.\r\n\r\nIf you say you're tired of being screamed at the only response you will get is \"don't let it get to you\" or \"push those bad vibes away\". It's literally no help. It's like telling a depressed person to \" just be happy\".\r\n\r\nManagement expects you to show empathy to customers while refusing to show any to you. \r\n\r\nThey recently did a \"customer zeal\" push. This customer zeal literally blamed all call center agents for bad calls instead of addressing the root of problem which is the operations team not picking up garbage. They're untouchable, though, since they're unionized so we get the blame. \r\n\r\nThe yearly raises are laughable. Doesn't even come close to matching inflation and if you get any bad occurrences you can't get a raise. And guess what?

They have  lost many talented people in their office just due to their lack of respect. Middle management is bloated and does little and lower management (supervisors) have job duties that could not be possibly fulfilled in less then 70 hours a week. They love to fire drivers with experience. The churn rate is ridiculous. They have so many safety rules that if every driver were to obey all of them they would have to double the amount of routes. They selectively enforce the rules based on whether or not they want to get rid of the driver. Some drivers are untouchable but most are nervous every day."}, {"review_title": "ok", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Leadership Trainee in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "such a great paying job", "cons": "the growth and development lacked"}], [{"review_title": "not recommend", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "close to home, public comp", "cons": "low pay, poor management, drama environment"}, {"review_title": "Could be a lot better..", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "12 Aug 2012", "job_title": "Driver in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Close to home, I met a lot of good guys..", "cons": "No respect for the work being done, favortism, lack of communication, pay, benefits etc."}, {"review_title": "Disgusted in Virginia", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "28 Aug 2012", "job_title": "Manager in Roanoke, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "salary benefits  Most hourly employees  and drivers are good  people good friends", "cons": "sales managers do not have experience to deal with customers or employees it all about sales quotas.

I am not a member of sales I am just setting back and watching. This  is not right. This was all overseen by Regional Manager.

Most of their trucks would not pass a decent D.O.T. inspection.  A driver complains or refuses to drive it and he will have a write up before the end of the week.

On the first day, I was wondering what koolaid the employees and management were drinking to be so passionate about working there. Coming in as a temp, I was expecting to be treated like just a number or meat in a blender; however, that was not the experience I felt at all. They really do want us to succeed and be happy, of course, our customers ultimately. Sure, they do have strict rules, but they're in place for a reason, which I can respect.

You are micro-managed at all times and in all honesty the office atmosphere is that of a kindergarten class.  Everyone blames each other for problems (including management)  instead of working together to fix issues.  If you enjoy gossip, this is definitely the place for you.  And don't forget being talked down to by management as if you are a child being punished.  Respect is not a factor here.
