Most employees must work 10-20 hours of overtime every week just to get their work done.  This was a constant complaint in the department but the only response ever received was that hiring more people was \"not in the budget\".  There is absolutely no legitimate training provided and you will learn by watching other people and then by making mistakes, which you will then get in trouble for.  Dealing with the satellite divisions is terrible, as half the time the correct contact will not even respond to you and you will have to escalate the situations to the highest level of management at these places to get anything done, which is a ridiculous waste of time.  Many of the job-related problems could be easily fixed with updates to software and procedures, but these suggestions are nearly unanimously shot down by the IT or executive departments as too expensive or not worthy of approval (even if they are approved, they take 6-12 months to implement after which more problems have already taken their place).\r\n\r\nThe management is horrendous at all levels, even the executive.  Every single one of them will push off their work onto their employees on a daily basis and act as though this is part of your job if anyone complained.  Meanwhile, the only work they do is go to meetings all day long, where they do nothing but sit on their phones and laptops and do not even pay any attention to what is going on.  They are making upwards of $100,000 a year but can barely even utilize Microsoft Outlook.  They have absolutely zero technical skills and could not do the job their employees do if they had a gun to their head.  Whenever a mistake is made on a case (even if the mistake is not yours), you WILL be blamed for it by management and have to take the blame when speaking to the customer, because \"the customer does not care about excuses\".  They whine constantly about the most basic parts of their jobs but make a giant deal out of any complaints that may come their way from their employees.  When you have finally achieved a point where you could apply to transfer out of the department, they will make up things to write you up for so you can't leave.  Dealing with them was truly the worst part of this job.\r\n\r\nReally, it might seem like a good opportunity at first light, but make sure you talk to the other employees honestly before committing to this company.  They WILL be honest with you about how backwards the company is, whereas the management will LIE to you to make themselves look better and to get you in the door.

Customer satisfaction is secondary to sales statistics such as FRF and ERF participation rates, which add as much as a third to the monthly service bill. Over the past four years, I have been asked three times to \"turn on the fees\" to customers that negotiated no fees on their contract. The strategy is to apply 20+% FRF and 10% ERF to these customers without warning and see who catches it.  It is common to hit customers with 15-17% price increases every year on top of the fees (also without notification).  If the customer balks and tries to \"quit\"; we are instructed to hold them to the letter of the contract or if no valid contract exists, implement a \"save at all costs\" strategy; a slash and burn tactic to ruin the profitability of the competitor.   There is a wannabe tough guy attitude at the very top of the company.  We see in the annual recording of the GM conference his idle threatening statements like \"do it our way or go someplace else\" management style.

He practiced unsafe acts daily, I went to my immediate supervisor about this, asking  if i could ride with someone else and he said NO! o as the next few days went by I could feel the tension between the trainer and myself but the sexual and racial statements didn't stop in fact they were full throttle.  So I emailed the manager above my supervisor with my concerns and the next morning he asked me about my concerns outside at the common smoking area and when i told them to him , his response \" oh don't worry about it the trainer is a good guy!\" So at this point I knew nothing was going to be done about this. So i moved forward by calling the awareness line! About a day or so later, all the retaliation started, I couldn't get my training, also, they had me doing a different job which wasn't too bad but it wasn't what i was hired for. This job became extreme because I could tell they were working to get me to quit but there was no way, I have a family to take care of. So when that tactic didn't work they sent me to another site(where i didn't apply at) put me with a guy who has been with the company for over 20 yrs and my supervisor told me this guy was going to train me. So after I learned as much as I could from this guy the guy told me I was ready to checked off on my training. I called my Supervisor and told him this and he states to me that this driver doesn't have the authority to request I be checked off!! So then I'm put in the truck with the BTW and after the week i', with him another Supervisor rides with me (I thought to check me off) and he states he can't check me off because my supervisor isn't ready for me to be checked off. So as i'm leaving Friday I asked 2 supervisors where to i go to work at on Monday and they both replied I don't know call your Supervisor. I called my Supervisor and got no answer Friday nor Saturday. o I texted him Sunday and he states report to the other Supervisor at the other site. o i texted the other Supervisor and he replies, Get with your Supervisor. When I say these people are unethical, unprofessional, and very discriminatory, I mean it. How sad is it that I used the tools which where given to me and I was sent away from where I applied(in order to keep the previous trainer happy), I've been held back on getting my training, I've been blackballed and pigeon holed as the company snitch, i've been sent to a facility where there's no women locker room!!!! really sad!!

The software they do use is cumbersome and requires a lot of tribal knowledge versus a clean organized one stop depository of information and functionality.

I have been given opportunities every week since I started to make more money, whether it be working Saturday, or doing extra work after my route is done. There's also opportunities for one man routes which pay more. Safety is definitely a priority at this company, they don't just talk it. They aren't perfect, but they do try to be safe most of the time. Routes are pretty reasonable. Start times aren't too early, days are anywhere between 7-9 hours. Definitely room to move up in the company if you prove yourself worthy. The company only hires CDL drivers, no helpers. You get paid for down time, so if you're broke down or waiting on a truck or your partner or whatever, they compensate you for that. Good benefits.", "cons": "Trucks have definitely seen better days.

If you've worked at a company this large then you know that this is pretty normal, at least in my experience it has been. The company uses a temp agency for helpers, so if you're doing a rearload route, there is the possibility you'll have to work with a temp. This is completely ridiculous to me because Republic claims to be dedicated to safety and quality service, then they bring in guys who are making 8$ an hour and who usually don't care about the job they are doing. It's also dumb because we're paid by the day, and they're paid by the hour. Being a garbage man does not require a great deal of intelligence, but to bring in people who have little to no training in the field, and no reason to care about the job they're doing, is completely asinine. It saves the company money, and that's why they do it. But it puts us in consistently dangerous situations because we're working with untrained and largely unmotivated individuals. They claim it's just a temporary solution until they hire more drivers, but from what I've been told it's been going on for several years. Company pays by the day, which I don't mind but some might not like that.

You can see cars backing out of driveways easier, watch for kids coming out to see the garbage truck and watch for kids and adults that walk under the automated arm while it is up in the air which happens more than you think and mostly by adults. So if your operating the truck from the right hand side and go in to a cul d sac and need to back up, you have to get out from the right side and get in to the left side before you back up a few feet. Then you can get back out and  in on the right side and start picking up carts again. Hopefully you can service the rest of the cul d sac with out having to back up again. If not, you get to go through this process again. I forgot to mention, not all the trucks even the new ones have electric mirrors for adjusting them so you need to do adjust them while your switching sides.

Highest market pricing,  Company has a bad name among businesses in Houston area which makes it almost impossible to hit your goal not to say that if you add all that required from you- cold calling, lead generation, prospecting, phone blocking, appointments, daily data input, paperwork processing, etc., etc., etc. there is not enough time in the day/week to complete your tasks, much less, quality time to spend prospecting and build customer relation, not enough time fo follow up, and finally make the sell everyone is waiting for except the rep that sold it because after all the hard work, aches, the pay out does not justify all the stress, time, effort that you put into it.\r\nOVERALL this company is very CONSISTENT in lacking of communication; very poor processes that change day-to-day; being disrespectul, and careless about customers and employees; extremely poor leadership; micromanagement; I also want to make it clear, this comment represents everything that I've seem and experienced within this organization."}, {"review_title": "Company culture sounds great, but lower middle management don't believe in it.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Above A Driver, Below A GM", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They treat their front line employees pretty good, and care about their well being.", "cons": "Treat your supervisors as well if not better.

Imagine a prospect in Pittsburgh wants to buy a dumpster, they can call a 412 or 724 number and be directed to a call center out of state that can sell to them on the spot. If that call center can't close the deal, you are sent a stale lead, and prospects that become angry when you try to offer a lower price (I was told by a prospect that it was a very shoddy business practice). Apart from many many former customers, they mistreat their new ones by having no way of ensuring their \"99.9% reliability rate\" is actually true. Lets not forget, contract based selling isn't a slam bam thank you ma'am transaction. Closing deals takes months, and sometimes years of waiting for a prospect to be in a window of time that they can cancel with their current provider. No one in their right mind wants to spend hundreds if not thousands to leave a contract. Most people are unaware that they don't even have the choice to switch even if they wanted. On top of it all, many competitors will match or beat whatever deal you have. You can't sell to businesses that are associated with an account that already exists, as that goes to the account managers. You can't sell to national accounts, either. I can not tell you how many doors I knocked only to be fed horror stories of how they were mistreated. Try selling someone a dumpster when their neighbor has an overflowing dumpster that hasn't been serviced as it should. I had to respond to customer complaints that would take away from my time selling. Management failed to tell me about how every single rep with my territories failed within a year. If you don't produce, don't plan to have a job. Don't plan on taking a vacation either, because your call/proposal/and visit metrics have to be met regardless if you take a week off or not. The office has bad juju. Its full of ghosts. You need to burn some incense before entering as it is just a black pit of misery. Some very wonderful people work there, but my goodness is it gloom and doom. Thankfully you won't spend much time in the office but when you are prepare to take the blame for lost business and not generating enough revenue. Do you know how many dumpsters you need to sell to achieve your monthly sales goal? More than possible. It is a churn and burn sales job. You will need therapy by the time you're 6 months in because your boss will scream at you like a child, or just not show up to planned ride along days. You'll hear one day that the sun shines out of your butt, and then the next day get put on a PIP. The training consists of memorizing a corny script that you will have to recite, which quite frankly, is laughable. The local competition wipes the floor and is sweeping the market because people don't like to be locked into auto renewing, rate-increasing contracts. The garbage game is TOUGH to win. They'll tell you how bad Waste Management is for locking their customers in auto-renewing contracts, but Republic does the same thing, and pissed Waste Management customers are really the only ones you can go for. You will eat sleep and breathe garbage. The job gets very lonely and you very seldom hear the good things you do, only that you are somehow the reason people don't want to buy an unreliable and over priced garbage service. At the end of the day I was not proud to attach my name to a company that takes advantage of the people that put money in their pockets and food into their bellies. Treat your customers and employees well, and you'll thrive. Punishing customers who have stuck by you by continuously raising their rate is criminal. & once they find out how much more they can be saving with the local competitors, they're never going to return. I get it, you get what you pay for. But you are NOT getting what you pay for with Republic. I've witnessed grown adults cry in the office. Garbage drivers, as lovely as they were to me, they lie constantly about what they've serviced, and honestly, they're probably overworked. However , you can't correct them because they're in a union and will strike. God forbid. Also, you will not have much upward mobility here. Unless you want to become an account manager and get screamed at all day and do wrong by customers by constantly raising their rate and explaining why they need to pay for a service they don't receive :) Also 95% of the sales reps don't meet their goals, so good luck if you want to sip the Kool-Aid!"}, {"review_title": "A company of high growth", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A company that rewards and recognizes its potential in corporate america and is up to the challenge by continually demanding excellence.", "cons": "The company is challenge with recognizing the pace at which it moves does not create stability of key programs and projects."}, {"review_title": "No recognition. company pleads poverty.
