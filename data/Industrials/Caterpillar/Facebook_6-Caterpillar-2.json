You have to literally lie or steal to get fired. There is a lot of good talent within Cat, but the focus doesn't seem to be on building those folks up and getting them exposed to other areas of the business.

Efforts to simplify were sometimes counterproductive as the low level detail reporting was removed by corporate, but middle management still required detail analysis for their comments.  This results in increased work due to the change.\r\n\r\nCaterpillar has a good model for promotions, but it has an interesting quirk.  The model is based on a bell curve with normal distribution for performance ratings.  You can NOT have too many people ranked in the highest percentile, and you MUST have some employees ranked in the lowest percentile.  In spite of this they insist that it is not a 'forced' distribution of rankings among their employees with 'world class talent'.  An interesting application of statistics for a Six Sigma company. \r\n\r\nSix Sigma is a good thing for Caterpillar, but there are a few areas where it is being misapplied:\r\n- The actual results of root cause investigation might not outweigh the force of a predetermined course of action.  If someone has a pet-project there will be a Six-Sigma project that determines it is the required solution.\r\n- Savings amounts grow in contrast to stated methodology. The first wave of Six Sigma was to go in and find the 'low hanging fruit' - the easy projects with biggest savings.  After that, the hard-core detail analysis was to be used to find smaller levels of savings hidden in the detail.  Largest to smallest?  No - there is an ever-increasing amount of 'savings' that must be newly found each year.

Decent benefits, medical/dental, 401K compan matching program up to 6%.  Respectable pay, would probably rank the pay as about average, compared to other companies in the same industry.  There's usually an annual bonus that is given out every year, bonus depends on company performance, your business unit performance, and what your salary grade is.  There is also an annual raise (before the economic downturn) between 4-6% of your base salary depending on your performance review. Very respectable work/life balance for the most part, there are definitley some jobs that require a lot more hours to be put in.  2 week paid vacation, plus 3 personal days.  You receive 3 weeks paid vacation after your 5 year mark.", "cons": "One of my biggest issues with the company after working there for almost 5 years, dealt with their performance review system.  Every employee is given a performance review on a yearly basis that ranges from a 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4, and 5 with 1 being the best, and 5 as you are most likely going to get fired.  The vast majority of employes fall with the 3a-3c range.  I had always received 3a ratings on all my jobs, except for one boss that refused to give me anything higher than a 3b.  He basically told me that I can't get anything higher than a 3b, because there was 'only so much money in the bucket.'  (his favorite phrase)  I used to find the performance review system almost comical because they have a series of 4 or 5 training classes on how its supposed to be done, but yet the majority of supervisors just give out what they want to give out depending on their budget or who they like the most (I'll get to that in a minute).  I've watched supervisors just give out ratings blindly while having no idea what type of work the employee did or is even working on.  The system is horrible, and at times is so unjust for certain employees it definitely lowers morale.  \n\nThis is one of the largest companies that has so many generations of family members working for the same company.  Most of the new employees are all from the Midwest.  The company previously used to actively recruit from diverse areas of the country, such as the South and various diversity conferences but has pulled away from such activities in recent years (I was also a former recruiter).  The company now solely concentrates on Midwestern schools, and just reinforces the SAME LACK OF DIVERSITY within the company.  In the end, your promotions and ratings depend on if you \"IN THE CLUB\" or \"NOT IN THE CLUB.\"  I definitely was not in club, and was not going to 'play the game' to get in.  Definitely a company with a mainly all male caucasian leadership team in ALL facilities.  \n\nI personally had a boss when I was working in Griffin, GA that really turned me off to the company.  He was THE WORST SUPERVISOR I have ever had in my life, including all jobs that I've had dating back to middle school.  He was very sneaky (so he thought), a liar, attempted to blackmail employees, and just a down right horror to work for.  He was the main reason why I left the company and as did so many others in his group.  If anyone from Caterpillar is reading this, this guy 100% had to have the worst attrition rate regarding management employees in all of DPP (I don't know why I was the only one who noticed it).  I was offered a promotion numerous times in another facility and he blocked every single one of them.  I know of him attempting to spy on other managers via the video camera system (that also fell within his department), and even attempting to bribe another top-line manager in the facility to promoting an employee, and if he did so, he would also get something out of it.  I don't mean to rant, but this is the type of stuff that goes on and these types of people just keep on movin up the ladder to just moved to another job because the company won't get rid of them even though they are destroying the company's culture.  \n\nThe last point that I want to make being an engineer, is that this company has way too many employees in high ranking managment positions that are not very intelligent.  I have no problems with someone not being informed or understanding something, but don't make decisions contrary to someone with a specialized expertise in something & you have absolutely no technical experience or knowledge, let alone even being a leader.  This is a company that has a lot of employees in mangement that have worked their way up from the shop floor, which I think is great, but a lot of employees are put in positions where they are leading people and don't have any leadership experience or qualities.  This company also values educational degrees, ON PAPER.  Definitely a lot of degrees obtained from the back of a match-book.  \n\nOverall I think this company has great potential to go above and beyond their 2020 goals of $100 billion, but they also need to go through and clean house, and get some people who know that they are talking about, that understand people, and how to lead them."}, {"review_title": "Excellent long term company to work for", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "19 Apr 2013", "job_title": "Senior Engineer in Mossville, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Challenging assignments. \nGood work life balance\nJob Flexibility\nMultiple career paths depending on individual profile, performance and interests. \nDual career moves for employee and spouse if moved outside of current work city. \nDunlap school district is very good for kid's education", "cons": "Industry market leader, but not a technology leader.\nAbuse of Six Sigma\nJob performance appraisal not consistent across various divisions\nLot of middle management. \nLot of focus on career development and training for management type postion, but not for technical roles\nMore people \"managing\" than \"doing\""}, {"review_title": "A great sounding place, but you're only a small fish", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Feb 2015", "job_title": "Pricing Analyst in Oak Creek, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Beautiful campus, the people are friendly and if you want to spend your life there, there are plenty of opportunities within the company and all over the world.", "cons": "Lots of bureaucracy and even on a small team, it often felt like management didn't know anyone's name. the building is set up as a cube farm, which makes it feel like a giant faceless machine"}, {"review_title": "great people; interesting management", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 May 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Peoria, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to work with great, talented, hard working people.  compensation is fair, but has become average for the area.  good benefits package and generally a good work environment.", "cons": "Inconsistency from management.  projects are hot a lava one day and thrown away the next for a variety of reasons.

For example, Caterpillar upper management understands how important to gain leadership position in emerging markets, however, after it missed the best 10-year window from 1990 - 2000, it did very little in the past 10 years.  When it comes to creating and managing partnerships, this company is very inexperienced and inflexible.  A lot of people who work at frontline of emerging market business are lack of international experience, lack of understanding of local culture and naively believe that things work in North America will work anywhere else.  It's a global company, but mentality wise, it's still an American company.  \n\n2) Performance management review is a joke.  In the accounting world at Caterpillar, it seems that some managers who get the job is solely based on technical skills, and little attention is given to people skills.  In addition, those managers did not get trained properly on how to deal with performance review and how to effectively communicate with subordinates.  As a result, some managers abuse performance review process and unfairly treat employees, especially during recession.  My former supervisor lied a lot of things on why he gave me a below average rating.  And when I found out about his lies, he changed his story to justify the rating given to me.  He failed to provide timely feedback during the year, failed to give me authority for me to do my work, and at end, he blamed me for not doing anything on a particular work while chose to completely ignored the progress and results I had done on other work.  He got the lowest score on employee opinion survey among his peers; guess what, he got a big promotion.     \n\n3) This company talks about diversity a lot, but it does not value too much mid-career hire's pre-Cat experience.  Let me give you one example.  Take a look at vacation policy.  Mid-career hires are treated as same as fresh graduate.  There is no consistent vacation policy from HR on mid-career hires.

It seems more like a group of friends giving each other jobs than an actual leader choosing the best suited people for his key positions. Here is a good example of the type of incompetence I am speaking of. We borrowed money and promised our investors we will hit 100 million dollars in sales by 2020. We want to hit this target so badly that we actually sell products at a loss. Knowing that we take a loss on the product, management then forces labor in for overtime to run this product.  Labor now gets paid double what we normally do, and are resentful because they are being forced in to work 60 hour weeks. Management does not care that this is bad for labor relations. There are currently one thousand or more guys are on a list of people ready to work, in the midst of a recession, and they don't call them back to help because they would rather maximally exploit their current employees. Although they acknowledge it is dumb to sell products at a loss, nobody will shut the line down until someone raises the price to an acceptable level. I have yet to see a CAT manager with any balls. If you have balls, the groupies will try to scare you into not saying anything. They will team up on you and find some dumb reason to write you up, with hopes that by threatening you with loss of job, you will not speak out again.
