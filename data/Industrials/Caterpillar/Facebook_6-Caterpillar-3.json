However, anyone reading many of these review surely can see a trend in the comments...coming from many people around the world.  So the culture described in so many posts regarding favoritism, good 'ol boy network, etc all ring true and it is truly pervasive at Cat.\r\n\r\nI've been in management for nearly 25 years.  There have always been negative elements to the culture, but the last 3.5 years, it has gotten worse since Oberhelman has taken over.\r\n\r\nIf you are not part of 'the group' and participate in, enhance, rally and defend the 'group think'...you soon find yourself on the outside.\r\n\r\nThe comment above, is very telling.  Before finding this website, I thought I was alone in my experiences of trying to counter the group think that occurs at Cat.  However, have seen many comments regarding this.  It's somewhat affirm, but sickening at the same time.\r\n\r\nBe warned before coming to Cat any opinons, thoughts, suggestions contrary to group think will be dealt with.  It will be quite subtle...it's not like someone immediately yells at you or anything....you'll just soon find yourself being excluded, ignored, etc.\r\n\r\nIt truly is a text book case of how cognitive dissonance affects managers at Cat.  It must be that middle managers are so fearful of repercussions from their bosses...they will stop at nothing to prevent information from flow above that reflects poorly on them.  Facts and data will ignored, information will be withheld, stories will be spun...Anything and everything will done and said to maintain the status quo.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I just sound like a disgruntled employee, and that may be the case to an extent.  However it is very sad to watch a Company that I truly did love and was proud to be a part of for over 20 years, change so rapidly and for the worse.\r\n\r\n25 years ago, Cat was the cream of the crop for an engineer to work.  Great pay and potential move around and up and have several careers at Cat in several different disciplines.  Those days are over.  It's pretty much day to day at Cat anymore, no ability to career plan....you have no idea if you'll be employed at the end of the year, let alone 5 years from now for which you could plan.\r\n\r\nDon't be suckered by the slick advertise Cat puts on about their inclusive environment and that employees are their most valued asset.  It is complete hogwash and double speak.\r\n\r\nThere are far better opportunities in the world than Cat, especially for any young person with an ounce of aspiration.
