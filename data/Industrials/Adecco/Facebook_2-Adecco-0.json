She seemed overworked and always in meetings. She never had time for me, including training. She worked late nights and weekends all the time. One of the reasons I decided to find another role was that her work style and management style were unhealthy and toxic, and her communication was poor. \r\n\r\nAnother thing is I didn't get credit for any of the work I had done; sometimes, my work was changed by my point of contact and presented to the team as if she had done the work. Sometimes I was in meetings and wasn't acknowledged by the other team members.
