With this company I look around at jobs that I would potentially want. What I see are a bunch of managers who work 60-80hr weeks, weekends, etc, they tell everyone below that we MUST meet these numbers and that saturday and sunday are game for work. They force salary employees to take a 2.5% pay reduction and expect that the vacation day after the furlough be worked as we must meet the numbers. They micromanage down to the suppliers, they fly people to hand carry parts as part shortages are rampant. They pay massive expedite fees and ensure that they hit their numbers at no cost. If you need to come in at 6 or 8PM or stay till then, well...we need to hit the numbers. So I look up at these people, these people who run these companies like this, who instill hatred into the workers who once loved their jobs and think to myself, I don't want a single one of these positions, and to think even deeper about it, that UTC drives this culture as these individuals have been promoted to these positions. So they drive numbers, they drive it at the cost of moral, of culture and work life balance. They make you feel insignificant and replaceable, and I am sure everyone is. They even make you one of the gears (people) in their COG. This company doesn't pay all that well, no wonder turn over is high. People celebrate when others get jobs at other companies, somewhat of a weird culture. Another very weird culture is what is being flown down from management. They put a lot of groups in impossible situations. One instance is utilization, and financial targets. With long cycle times they push to meet financial goals so you focus resource efforts to hit those targets, once the month is done you are left with a gap in production because the resources were focused on moving product out the door, they turn around and ask why there is a gap and why utilization is effected Probably because you told us to work 12 hours days sat/sun to move product out the door, how can you not understand the rammifications of doing so, you are sacrificing level loaded production through long assemblies for production numbers, I cannot hit all goals when you tell me goals that directly conflict, catch 22. I cannot simultaneously train and have high utilization at the same time. Progress comes from training and investment, yet you look at numbers and charts and you expect change just because we are tracking them. Large changes come from training and investments, small incremental changes do come from process improvements, but when you hamstring us with part shortages, you screw all your measurements, and the worst of all is our group has no control over it. So being put in these situations is very frustrating for the group and leads to low morale.\r\n\r\nWould I recommend my daughter to work here, Only if she needed the money, but I would recommend working somewhere else.

Early career leaders are stretched in manufacturing, quality, and supply chain challenges that have direct, significant impact to the businesses.  \r\n\r\nThe OLP Associates have full exposure to the business in their roles and through networking and mentoring. You will not find better access to executives throughout the company.  The exposure to solving tough problems, strategic leadership guidance, and the future direction of the company is also key to the program\u2019s attractiveness.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility and position of the OLPs leads to enormous leadership growth over the two years. OLPs regularly evaluate their skills and the program strategic places OLPs to stretch their skill gaps. OLPs have to work hard to grow in those areas but leave the role much stronger.\r\n\r\nOLPs have the support of the program and business to facilitate the moves between businesses, as well.  Roles are screened for impact to the business and the business supports the OLPs logistic and financial needs with a comprehensive moving package.\r\n\r\nThe OLPs have numerous opportunities to network in and outside their teams and businesses. The name of the program itself opens doors to supportive executives that give mentoring, both formally through assigned executive mentors, and informally, as OLPs reach out to mentors per their career interests and development needs.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the two years, OLPs are not short on job opportunities. The program is a two year interview with countless opportunities to present to executives and hiring managers.  Taking full advantage of the company\u2019s leadership development review boards, the program puts OLPs at the forefront of key hiring needs.  OLPs go on to direct their interests and often have multiple opportunities to choose from.\r\n\r\nThe program is overall a great environment to grow operations talent. The OLPs themselves develop a wide support network within their cohort of fellow associates as well as the larger employee network. The program recognizes the challenges OLPs take on, even more than the company\u2019s already strong reward for performance culture.  \r\n\r\nThe overall benefits of the program are incalculable. As a former OLP, just recently graduated in 2017 I have no regrets to the challenges and adventures that the program offered me.  I would not have been able to springboard my career with the amazing experiences, supportive network, and leadership insights it provided.", "cons": "The program stretches across all businesses and dozens of sites within the company, each with their own local culture. Some roles, despite the screening, do not fully give the OLPs support initially. Still, a strong OLP finds there\u2019s always work to be done and quickly motivates the site to support them by loading them up with added responsibility by exceeding expectations of performance over and over."}, {"review_title": "Perhaps we should call ourselves disparate technologies", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Jan 2009", "job_title": "Aerospace Flunkie in Canoga Park, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I work for a division of Pratt & Whitney which is one of the major business units of UTC.

They have also moved to outsource virtually all of their information technology assets.
