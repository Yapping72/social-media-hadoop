Employees have the ability to work their own schedule based on both personal (doctor's appointment, sick kids, etc.) and professional needs (deadline to meet, unexpected proposal to write) as long as they meet 40 hours for the week.

The Program Managers come to me for data, analysis, understanding and advice.\r\n3) The End Customer - The US Gov is not fun to work for; HOWEVER working with the military and knowing how quality product reach our customer IS fun to work for\r\n4) Benefits - 401K matching, tuition reimbursement, GREAT health/dental/vision benefits compared to most Fortune 500, rotational Leadership Development Programs, classes (including Six Sigma training)\r\n5) Work-life Balance - You work pretty close to a 40-hour work week in most positions, business or engineering; Also, a lot of sites, including Dallas, work a 9-80 schedule, which means every other Friday is off! Believe it or not, it's even more enjoyable than it sounds.  Vacation is great and the plant shuts down at Christmastime (and that doesn't take away from your vacation hours!\r\n6) Locations - After a year in a job, it's not too difficult to move to other locations across the country if you want; and Lockheed helps pay for the move\r\n7) Products - We make fighter jets and missile launchers.  What we do is LITERALLY rocket science.  It's pretty cool.  I like telling people I work for real-life Stark Industries.\r\n8) Advancement - Some might feel it comes too slow, but generally you can move up a level every 2-3 years for the first 10 years, which means a pay bump.", "cons": "I've had several coworkers leave for several different reasons.  Here are some cons I see and have heard from others:\r\n1) Pay - Although the pay starts out competitive, it doesn't grow as fast as other companies.  Many of my coworkers left for other companies in the area and got a 20-25% pay bump.  Of course, they lose some perks, like every other Friday off, etc, but they get more dough.\r\n2) Culture - Lockheed Martin is fairly old school.  That appeals to some, but a lot of Millennials I see struggle with it.  Millennials often feel leaders micro-manages too much, that advancements don't come quick enough, that they are not being recognized for all their contributions.\r\n3) The Customer - Working for the war fighter feels awesome.  Working for the war fighter through departments in the US Government is frustrating.  The problem is, Lockheed Martin relies on one main customer - the USG.  So what is to stop the gov from demanding what they want?  Competition is tough, so LM has to give in a lot.\r\n4) No Bonuses\r\n5) Earned Value Management - Defense Contractors have to follow a system of measurement that is unique to defense contractors called Earned Value Management.  EVM can be useful but it requires a lot of extra work on the part of the engineer and financial analyst.  And it really doesn't translate to the world outside of government work.\r\n6) Pigeon-hole - This is for financiers more so than other business areas or engineers; the type of financial work defense contractors do is pretty different than most commercial companies.  If you want to move to another industry but you have been at LM a long time, you might find it hard to pitch what you have done in a way that is relatable to other companies.\r\n7) High Level Management Doesn't Care - Honestly, this is probably true for most companies.  The Missiles & Fire Control division just went through layoffs (for the first time in a long time) and honestly, it didn't seem like upper management cared too much.  The packages given to those laid off were decent, but it didn't feel like management shared in our pain.  The CEO also seems like she has no interest in the individual employee.  When the government shut down and some contracts had to be put in stop-work, she didn't really offer a lot of support to those who had nothing to work on.  They just had to wait it out."}, {"review_title": "Severely Lacking in Good Practice!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Nov 2017", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Cafeteria closes up, leaves free coffee at end of the day.

First week had Friday off, next week 2 days off (thanksgiving and day after, Paid), The next week had Friday off again. This is my first full working week and it has been great. Fridays are generally easier because people are out. I have met some people that never work Fridays too.\r\n\r\nVacation Time- 3 weeks paid vacation starting, 25 off Fridays, 11 paid federal holidays. 5 sick days and 3 personal days. \r\n\r\nGreat Co-Workers- I was blessed to be with a pretty young crowd, mid to late 20's early 30's. Of course there are some a bit older, but it's a good mix. \r\n\r\nTeam Environment- Happy hour every Thursday before our off Friday. The last Friday of every month we celebrate that months birthdays with a small party (food and drinks).\r\n\r\nMonthly Cooking Competitions.( last month we had 50+ different salsas and dips) January is desserts \r\n\r\nNice Equipment- I was given a nice laptop and case my first day. Lots of office supplies, 2 computer monitors, Ice/Water machine..\r\n\r\nNo Micro-Management. Have yet to feel like my manager is constantly watching over me. \r\n\r\nWork Environment- Probably the best part about Lockheed Fort Worth, this  is where we assemble the JSF F-35 Lightning II and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. I can take a 5 minute walk and be staring at complete fighter jets (that will actually be flown, possibly in combat, and are not sitting in a museum). It is incredible \r\n\r\nProducts: We build the worlds leading technology. There are many more, but to name a few:\r\n\r\n1) Orion Spacecraft that flown 12/5/2015 around the earth, may take people to mars, and was the farthest flown Man-able capsule in 40 years\r\n2) SR-71 Blackbird, the fastest air breathing manned aircraft ever \r\n3) The worlds first and only Nuclear Fusion reactor \r\n4) F-35 Lightning II \r\nAll built by Lockheed Martin\r\n\r\nThe Worlds Largest Defense Contractor and a Fortune 500 Company- Number 59 in 2014 \r\n\r\nCompensation- I received offers from BAE Systems, OHA Private Equity, and Warren Douglass. Lockheed had the highest salary, and a sign on bonus. Started at 55k with 1k sign on. ( BBA in Accounting 3.4 GPA from A&M in 2.5 years) \r\n\r\nGenerally Upbeat- Any person you meet is willing to help you. My 3rd day here I was lost looking at a fire evacuation map on the wall (having no sense of direction) a woman stopped and asked me if I was lost, I told her I was, and  where I was trying to go and she walked me directly to the office. She didn't just point and say some directions that I likely couldn't have followed; we walked together, and showed me  some landmarks incase I got lost again. We had a great conversation too. \r\n\r\n9/80 Schedule- 9/80 means you work the following schedule: \r\n         M-9hrs, T-9,  W-9,  R-9,  F-8;       M-9,  T-9,  W-9,  R-9,  F-OFF. \r\nMost corporate jobs require 9 hours a day anyway, and never get Fridays off. \r\n\r\nFlex Time- If you need to leave early one day, or know you will be leaving early in the future you can work extra an extra hour or two one day and take off early the next. Mostly use it only when you need to. \r\n\r\nHours- If you come in at 6 you can leave at 3 (with no lunch). I get in at 7 a.m. and usually leave at 4:30-5. \r\n\r\nRetirement Plan- We have a pretty great retirement package, a top competitor of any Fortune 500 Company. The total company contribution is roughly 7%. Capital Contribution 3%, SSP Company match up to 4% (at 8% employee contribution), so maxing out your marginal contribution totals up to 15% toward retirement. Considering that the average American saves <5% per year, Lockheed is pretty good.\r\n\r\nTelecommuting/ Work From Home- I have yet to work from home but there are some in my office that do, and I was told in my first day lunch meeting with my manager that I will be able to after about 6 months. Some departments let you work one day from home every week, just depends on your department. My HR rep was one of those that did. \r\n\r\nLast Thing- Don't believe all you hear about not being noticed and the company being too big to succeed. If you work hard, and get stuff done you will move up fast. I was concerned about this when I started but after asking around I found that you will typically jump a level every year to 15 months which means a minimum of 10k raise, plus a yearly performance bonus of about 4%. A girl in my office jumped 2 levels in 18 months. Transferring to a different business unit can make that process go faster, and usually will get a bigger than a 10k raise (unlikely to be more than 15k) until you have had 7-12 years of service and are getting a manager, senior manager, or director role. Pay raises are based on how much effort you put in. I have met some people that have not attempted gain access to the computer systems after over a month of being here, (which is critical to get actual work done) yet I got all my security clearance and system access in 4 days. I also ask for work to do, and am happy to do the repetitive tasks that slow down my teammates.", "cons": "The Walk- Depending on where you work the walk could be 10+minutes from your car. Luckily, my area of the building is close to a main entrance and non-numbered parking, allowing me to get inside and sat down in less than 5 minutes. A motorcycle guarantees close parking and a short walk. \r\n\r\nThe Food- The food found in Aero Caf\u00e9 and 50 Foot Isle is overly expensive. Easy to spend 8-12$ on a meal on food that is decent quality. Aero Caf\u00e9 has a bigger selection and some less expensive choices but is easily a 800 meter walk from my office.\r\n\r\nNo Covered Parking- I have seen a handful car with paint peeling and fading from baking in the sun for hours on end. I am debating purchasing an older used car as a commuter to work simply for that reason."}, {"review_title": "Where your 30+ years makes you as valuable as an intern", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone has heard of them", "cons": "Let me preface this by stating I work for the IS&GS division.
