Mostly under the radar, up to 30,000 layoffs have happened in the last several years, and more layoffs are coming. My LM colleagues are looking over their shoulders for the ax; morale is absolutely terrible in Sunnyvale, CA, and likely at most other company facilities. Just last week, LM targeted several new facilities for closure, with another several thousand jobs lost.    \r\n\r\nThere used to be many development and educational programs available, but most have been cut in the last couple of years (or dried of support), so many fine employees are now left on their own, with little or no support (outside of their manager's advice) in their efforts to advance.\r\n\r\nWork/life balance varies wildly, some are lucky to be working a normal and easy 40-hour week. For my first five years, I worked between 55-70 hours a week; my last eight years have averaged 48. Some very senior managers (or those on proposals) work seven days a week, and haven\u2019t had a day off in a year, or more. \r\n\r\nFor the last 8-10 years, the company\u2019s mantra has been \u201cWe never forget who we\u2019re working for,\u201d urging even more hard work and sacrifice from you, all because the company supports our government and military (which I also strongly do). But, in the end, it\u2019s just propaganda; LM has turned out to be just another company wanting to make money, and (in the words of a company VP) they \u201cwill get everything they can from you.\u201d The only things proven to be really important to LM are profits, the shareholders, and the customers buying the products. Those customers end up calling many of the shots in project engineering and management, and on many occasions, they have ruined an engineer's, manager's, Director's or VP's career on a whim or a disagreement, or just a personal issue in a meeting. Employees are disposable to Lockheed Martin; those that are truly valued and respected are rare. Running afoul of a company policy is just fine when the company does it and it benefits the company, but when an employee does it, it's big trouble, and likely termination.

For example, I was hired in 2015, but program was decided to be moved to MD in 2016, so the entire team was threatened to be laid off.  There were about 60 of us.  Now, about 20.  And the deadline is end of fiscal year.   \r\n- Management is the typical political scenario.  They say they care about their employees, but actually don't, or perhaps don't know how to.  For example, Management had no plan on moving employees to new positions before announcing end of program.\r\n- Very slow hiring process.  There's an internal job board, but the process is so slow that response from inquiries take months.\r\n- Got food poisoning from the cafeteria and found several other people also threw up.\r\n- A lot of bureaucracy to get software installed on your workstation.  For example, took 3 weeks to install Notepad++.\r\n- Possibility of losing your clearance.  For example, if you have a TS/SCI clearance, but the project's customer requires a Polygraph, LM will not read you on for your SCI, so you will lose your SCI clearance if you wait for your Poly adjudication for more than 2 years, which is highly likely.  Some employees' clearance was completely removed due to LM security ineptitude.\r\n- Performance evaluation process takes a lot of time/effort out of your day.  A lot of bureaucracy again.\r\n- Weird Paid Time Off (PTO) plan.  2 weeks of vacation + supplemental 1 week vacation + undetermined personal time off that you can take unlimited amount because there's no written rule, but is generally frowned upon if you take more than a week.  You can carry over only 2 weeks vacation to the next year, but can only accrue up to 400 hours.\r\n- Pay is on the low side.  They claim benefits and stability, but that's probably not true.  Medical/dental/vision for employee+spouse+children is about $560/month for premiums.  Not too high compared to other small companies, but since small companies will pay you more than $1,000/month more than your cost of benefits, the LM pay seems a bit low.  If your level of performance is high, you get 1% pay raise.\r\n- Expectations are higher than your pay grade.  For example, management expected a Level 5 engineer to attend symposiums, write patents, publish journals, but his pay was on the level of a senior programmer and he was not given funding to attend symposiums.\r\n- Numerous compliance training requirements."}, {"review_title": "Field Engineer", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Sept 2016", "job_title": "F-35 Field Engineer in Fort Worth, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pros to working at Lockheed are that there are plenty of opportunities to cross over to different jobs as you gain experience with how the company operates.", "cons": "If you are an hourly employee such as an aircraft Field Service Mechanic, there is a high possibility of going through difficult financial times as a result of layoffs, recalls, and Union strikes."}, {"review_title": "Not the worst but could be so much better.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 May 2017", "job_title": "Administrator in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible working patterns are in place which are beneficial but purely to suit the local site and contracts  in place. \nDecent salary on offer, but over-shadowed by many of the cons.", "cons": "Top- heavy management team, could do with restructuring and more experience. \nInconsistency across management decisions particularly regarding HR policies such as authorising comp leave etc. \nNo clear direction from management. \nFace-fits and jobs for the boys culture. \nDifficult to balance work/life. \nHigh expectations for little reward. \nUnprofessional and to an extent unethical working practices. \nLow morale within workers. \nUnfair and very biased employee recognition and rewards scheme."}, {"review_title": "Good company poor health insurance", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 May 2019", "job_title": "Proposal Analyst in Fort Worth, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Every other Friday off, good pay and 401k plan, flexible schedule, friendly staff and exciting products", "cons": "Health insurance is terrible, family of 5 costs $130/wk, plus high deductible and out of pocket max.

The internship program was great; I was surrounded by intelligent, like-minded individuals with a strong drive and a passion to create. We were given the opportunity to think outside of the box and search for methods to streamline the business. More importantly, however, was the feeling of culture during the internship. We were often brought together to discuss the company, socialize, or even brainstorm. \r\n\r\nAfter a few months with the company as an intern, I was offered a full-time position in IT. At that time, many of the other interns had returned to school, and the realities of the company became apparent. As a millennial entering the company, the first thing you'll notice is the huge age discrepancy in the workforce. You're likely to be the youngest person on your team, and most other individuals will be over 40. This isn't specific to a certain area of the company; a huge percentage of the workforce will be eligible  to retire within the next 5 years (but they probably won't. Many people stay well past the retirement age). The age discrepancy makes it difficult for millennials to assimilate into the company, because (lets face it) we move at a faster pace.\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin lacks company culture. There's no sense of community, and the sponsored events are few and far between. You're never going to feel excited to go to work, because the company doesn't really try to motivate you. We are almost never given the opportunity to be creative, because \"there's no budget for that.\" This may or may not be the nature of the defense industry in general, but as a millennial it's extremely miserable. I believe part of this is due to the fact that there is a large age discrepancy in the workforce, but no initiative has been taken by upper management to correct it. \r\n\r\nIndividuals that are used to a free flowing and face paced environment will not be at home here. A minute task can take a week or more due to the business process requirements and the security constraints. You're forced to jump through so many hoops to get your job done, and many of the existing programs and processes are so dated that they're nearly impossible to navigate. The company is reluctant to explore new avenues to streamline these programs and processes (although upper management claims to foster innovation), and it's likely that you'll never be working with cutting edge technologies. \r\n\r\nFor lower level employees, job advancement is not dictated by your track record or knowledge, but rather by interpersonal skills only. Most of the younger managers at the company obtained their jobs after completing the leadership program,  which focuses on networking within the company and spending a few months working on different projects. It's the definition of a popularity contest, and many graduates of the program have little to show in terms of job performance.\r\n\r\nI was excited & thankful when I first started working full-time at Lockheed Martin, but time has made me realize that the company just isn't fit for millennials. Individuals (especially those in IT) that want an interesting & exciting career won't find it here.

Rating is based against people in your job classification so upon a promotion you are little fish in big pong and have to go against people with what could be 10+ more years experience.

Relatively easy to get by with mediocre effort so long as your project has a lot of hours to burn.  Company name looks good on your resume to other employers.", "cons": "Overall, I was not impressed with the leadership, product quality, team synergy, work environment, review system, career growth, and turf conflicts at this company and ultimately decided to leave for greener pastures.  It was fine for a couple of years but in the long-term it was not a viable environment for me.  You are essentially filling the role of a mercenary when working here.  The engineering teams are led by the engineers who have hung around the longest while many of their former peers have left for better opportunities.  The role of the engineer is to charge an hour to a Government project and the company turns around and bills that hour to the customer of which a portion ends up in the engineer's paycheck.  As a result, the priority from upper management is to burn up as many hours as allowable which often comes at the expense of producing a quality product.  Despite the Corporate slogans about performing with excellence, the management is more than happy with a solution that poorly meets requirements and is completed within the allotted hours rather than spending the extra time to implement it the right way.  Before the hours run out on your project, be sure to start asking around where the other projects are.  If you do not have a project to bill hours to, your functional manager may try to find you some makework on another project, otherwise you may consider yourself on notice.  As a result, the environment is fear-driven.  The employees are always concerned about what is going to happen when their project ends.  The byproduct is a group of engineers of the type who are forever grateful to have a job and are therefore willing to put up with managerial nonsense that includes harassment training, charade reviews, and mock-career-discussions.  The career path for engineers is short.  If you do not move toward a management role, your opportunities for advancement are limited. The general perception among the Engineers is that the company does not appreciate them and views them as replaceable cogs.  The attitude of the management is that of Government - if an employee quits, they will hire another one.  The review system is shrouded in secrecy, mystery, and hand-waving as management is uncomfortable admitting that it is a charade and prefers to tap-dance around the issue and put on a happy face.  Employees who ask too many questions about the system's fairness create the perception causing trouble.  Essentially, the functional management is given a fixed quota of ratings from a limited pool that are to be doled out.  The review process consists of what is internally referred to as \"the rack and stack\" Belle-curve where the competing managers have a sit-down and figure out who goes where on the curve.  Some employees are fought for and others are compromised on. Since their quota system makes it mathematically impossible for everyone to be performing at an acceptable level, someone always has to draw the short straw and receive the poor performance review which will then be used to justify the denial of a merit increase.  During the review phase, the employees are also directed to engage in a game of charades by collecting peer feedback which consists of finding your 3-4 best friends within the company and having them say some nice things about you.    In some cases people were writing their own peer feedback as their colleagues found that easier rather than having to write it themselves.  The worst part of the system is that it places the employees in a psychological position of competing with their team members which severely impacts team performance as everyone knows that it is in their own best interest to carve out a piece for themselves and become the go-to expert rather than  threaten their own supremacy by actively helping to get others up to speed.  I never saw anyone laid off as the result of a review, but certainly it could be easily spun in a negative way if your manager were directed to trim the headcount.  As a result, the performance review time is always a degrading period of low morale among the staff as everyone is jockeying and trying to not be the one standing when the music goes off.   There are those who benefit from the system and are quietly supportive of it.  These tend to be the engineers with the most tenure or those who have managed to carve out a specialty on an important project or curry social favor with their manager.  This creates a disadvantage for new engineers as the performance rating of a new engineer is compared other engineers in the same pay-grade even though the others may have been with the company for a longer period of time and therefore have an uneven advantage.  Management also imposes a passive-aggressive overtime policy.  They unofficially want everyone clocking an extra couple hours each week which some individuals interpret as an extra 15 minute restroom break in the morning and an extra 15 minute restroom break in the afternoon; it is impossible to police yet the cost gets passed on to the customer and the company generates additional profit while it absolves itself of all ethical liability by hanging the responsibility on the employee.  Overall, I would recommend this workplace to recent college graduates who need a couple years of industry experience before finding a better work environment.  Also I would recommend this to those near-retirement looking for somewhere to ride out for a few years and collect a paycheck."}, {"review_title": "Where brain cells go to die...", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "15 Jul 2012", "job_title": "Senior Electrical Engineer in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The compensation is good for the Orlando, FL area and the 401k matching is good.

There area few technical classes taught in-house and tuition reimbursement.", "cons": "Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) is far behind the technological advances of the last 10 or 20 years. The job of the average engineer is to generate paperwork to maintain or make updates to an existing line of \"tried and true\" products.\r\n\r\nWhen you enter this world, fresh out of college, you quickly begin to lose the useful skills you learned. There are a few classes offered to keep your skills sharp. I once attended a C++ class, taught by a non-LMCO employee. I pondered why no in-house software engineers were capable of teaching the class until a Senior Staff Software Engineer showed up, but as a student who proceeded to interrupt every 10 minutes to ask questions about basic programming concepts.\r\n\r\nAt MFC, it is not uncommon to work for someone with a limited grasp of basic engineering concepts, who either has no technical degree or a degree in an unrelated field. This combination of non-technical managers and technical employees should work, except when the manager is a micromanager, which is prevalent at MFC. I once had a manager suggest that I combine an inverter with a multiplier to create a Verilog divider. Unfortunately, \"suggest\" meant \"go do it now\" and I was left contemplating how to violate the laws of physics.\r\n\r\nThe employees that are promoted are not necessarily the most productive or even the most knowledgeable employees. The secret to who excels and who is allowed to languish in the same labor grade remains a mystery. There is a review process where co-workers list your strengths and weaknesses. But, the rating of the average employee seems to be predetermined and the strengths and weaknesses seem to be \"massaged\" to justify the predetermined rating. Some years, I personally felt that I performed poorly (more clerical than technical duties), but I received a high rating. And some years where I worked 70 hour weeks and worked two projects, I got below average ratings.  It seems like a random number generator generates the ranking of the average employees, but for the coveted employees, a high rating is ensured regardless of their successes or more importantly, their failures.\r\n\r\nSome older employees are treated in a less than fair manner in an attempt to reduce the average age of the workforce by forcing the older employees to retire. It is difficult to introduce new concepts or ideas to the engineering community because the age of average worker is 50+, but the solution is not to lay them off or force them to retire. Older employees possess a wealth of useful knowledge that is never passed to the next generation. MFC attempted to correct the problem by implementing a mandatory mentorship program that has been a massive failure. I think this is largely due to the Leadership and Development (ELDP) program, which provides a fast-track for college new hires to management positions in 2 or 3 years. The prospect of a 50+ employee being micromanaged by a 25-year old with absolutely no technical experience, is a slap in the face for the older employees, and seems to lead to a rift between the two age groups, and thus a lack of participation in the mentorship program. But, the ELDP program ensures a new generation of non-technical incompetent managers will continue to micro-manage competent engineers, thus continuing the cycle or \"tried and true\" behavior that seems to serve this company so well.\r\n\r\nThere is a pervasive culture of laziness and unprofessionalism. There are 5000+ people at MFC, but only about 20% of those employees are productive, where I define productivity as working a dismal 50% of the day. Roughly 60% of the younger employees roam the hallways distracted by their phones. And 75% of the other employees spend the day engaged in pointless non-work related conversations either on the phone or with their non-productive counterparts. In this culture, employees that actually enjoy being productive are viewed in a negative light, since they don't enjoy \"sharing\" with their fellow employees, where \"sharing\" means over-sharing every day, for hours, within full earshot of everyone in the wall to wall sea of cubes, which creates a very non-productive environment for anyone attempting to do meaningful work.\r\n\r\nWorking at MFC is great if you plan to stay forever. You will get paid an above-average salary for the area and the benefits are good. But, if you plan to use MFC as a stepping stone, you will fall short.  After working on trailing edge technology for years, you will be ill-equipped to pursue a career in the commercial world, and will quickly be rendered as obsolete as that MFC \"tried and true\" technology that had its heyday in the 1980s.\r\n\r\nThe title of this review comes from a conversation with my lunch buddy, who had been passed up for promotions and decent work assignments for years until he finally opted to retire. In the months prior to his departure, he worked for a lead who was confused about whether it was resistors or capacitors that add when placed in series."}, {"review_title": "Overall, great place to start your career", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Oct 2012", "job_title": "Subcontract Administrator Asc in Fort Worth, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Plenty of resources and knowledgable people\r\nEducation Assistance\r\nCompetitive Salary/Benefits\r\nExcellent Work/Life Balance\r\nDecent Management", "cons": "Typical big company; very political.

Although, Lockheed seems to recruit from the second tier technical schools, they generally go for the absolute best talent at those schools. That said, you will still find a few MIT grads working there. As the largest A&D contractor in the US, you will find ample opportunities to work on a variety technologies with a wide variety of customers and their applications of technology.  Many managers, rise from the technical ranks. However, to rise to the executive ranks, those with the best interpersonal skills survive their technical assignments until they get to management assignments to leverage their soft-skills. For military transitioning into this company, it is a very patriotic culture where integrity is strictly enforced. Most military personnel find it easy to adapt at Lockheed.  For seasoned professionals transitioning into the company, the pay and benefits are very competitive and the technical work is some of the best.  For early career professionals, it is an excellent place to start your career provided you are one of the top students in your class. It is a company rich with opportunity and exposure to new things. For all employees, if you are fortunate enough to be deemed a high-potential (Hi-Pot) employee, then Lockheed Martin has some of the best leadership training and professional development in the world.", "cons": "As a company, Lockheed can be brutal on incompetence and failures.  By this, as a technical professional, your ideas, knowledge and abilities will constantly be questioned by peers and managers. Everyday to show up for work, you have to prove yourself all over again.  If you can not defend your technical knowledge successfully you will be marginalized and most likely leave the company.  The mark of death by the technical professionals is to be called a \"non-technical.\"  If you can not shake this label, then everything you say will fall on polite but deaf ears.  The culture is harsh on anyone that do not strive for professional excellence. If this happens, your best hope is to find a position in management.  \r\n\r\nAs for managers, failure to meet extremely challenging objectives or satisfy even the most difficult customers is dealt with harshly.  In many cases it can be the end of your career at Lockheed Martin.  It only takes one failure to be tagged unworthy of leadership and part of the \"de-railed\" class of managers that float around seeking redemption.  Your only chance of recovery is a guardian angel in the executive ranks that has clout.  Otherwise, start looking for new opportunities or resolve your career ambitions to your current role in the company.  As a result of this cultural attitude, Lockheed is a very conservative, risk adverse company.  \r\n\r\nWhich leads to the Lockheed \"innovation misconception.\"  Although, Lockheed is great for innovative problem solvers it is not much fun for creative, intuitive, or artistic thinkers.  Unless you can back up your creative ideas with irrefutable detailed facts & figures; then, decision-makers will most likely dismiss you and your ideas.  If you persists with your \"brilliant ideas\" they may label you as an \"eccentric.\"  Most successful revolutionary innovations at Lockheed occur when the ideas are developed under the radar and revealed as proof of concepts; or, with approved IRAD funding.  However, if you expend company resources under the radar and fail to deliver a successful innovation; then, you've just signed your career death certificate at this company.  Lets face it, Lockheed is more an engineering company and less a design studio or R&D firm. They solve complex problems they do not set out to create novel technologies.  So don't be confused by the innovation propaganda. If you want true creative innovation, consider GE, Battelle Memorial labs, Apple, IDEO,  etc. If you want to solve complex problems, then consider Lockheed."}, {"review_title": "Good Stable Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "8 Oct 2014", "job_title": "Systems Engineer in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you are identified as a high contributor you are treated well.

It is horrible and it makes people wish for the old evaluation system back.\r\n\r\n-Like most corporations these days, they try to get you to do more with less. As the older generation retires, they expect you to take over their jobs, which is fine, but they don't compensate you for any of the extra work you take on. \r\n\r\n-Raises are horrible. Average 1-3 percent a year, and if you are the absolute cream of the crop, maybe 5 percent. This may be average for this economy as whole right now, but it really is shameful for a company that is the number one defense company in the world with a stock just under $200. You would think they might open up the wallet a little to keep employees from leaving since they got rid of pensions but no, Lockheed is happy to give you  dirt devil or a backpack before they ever give you a decent cost of living raise.\r\n\r\n-Management has got their head so far up in the clouds they rarely have time to address employee concerns on projects. Most are dismissive, condescending, and act like they could care less about the status of your projects.\r\n\r\n-This is coming from an employee who had a generally good first 3 years at the company.

A lot of other companies/people still look at Lockheed Martin on a resume and are impressed. There are *some* cool projects in the company. \r\nThey do provide relocation if needed for fresh college grads.\r\n9x80 schedule is appealing to some people.", "cons": "I can only speak for Software Engineering - other areas of the company may be great, but that's not my thing.\r\n\r\n1. Outdated Technology. You want to stay current in the software industry? Don't look here. There's a reason why a lot of the higher up Software Engineers you meet have been at the company for 10+ years. They're no longer marketable to the modern industry. That might sound harsh, but it's true. Bringing on new/modern technology onto any program can be near impossible with security requirements, leaving you working with dated and deprecated technology and libraries. Some programs are starting to utilize AWS, which is nice. But the security requirements the company puts on usage are again, pretty extreme.\r\n\r\n2. Lackluster benefits/wages. Health care costs doubled over the past year. No new coverage, no new benefits. Literally the same health coverage for double the cost. 401k Company contributions are 50% of your contributions up to 4% of your total. That's ok, but also not as competitive as other modern Software Dev companies. Vacation is ok, although nothing to be excited about. Salaries are probably slightly below National (USA) averages. Which brings us to performance reviews.\r\n\r\n3. Performance Reviews. Lockheed uses some absolutely ridiculous system they call LM Commit, where you're expected to basically write down a handful of ways you will bring about solid, measurable benefit to the company. Ok, a lot of companies do something like this, whatever. Problem being, your commitments are rarely your own. They're almost always handed down from management and you copy/paste them in. So on paper you're committing to be a generic worker for the next year. Performance Reviews are based on these LM Commits. Issue here, they use a bell-curve system - and it's common knowledge that managers will give employees with a longer service time higher scores than younger/fresher employees. So it's really not an issue of how well you're performing, it's how many people in your program have been there longer than you. If you're doing average overall, you can expect about 1.3% increase yearly from just reviews. This doesn't always match inflation btw, so realistically even a small raise might be less money in the long run.\r\n\r\n4. 80's-esque workplace environment. Are you a young software engineer brimming with excitement? You've seen pictures of those cool google-like workplaces with open floorplans, collaborative areas, free snacks/drinks, and generally things that make you not dread coming to work? That's not Lockheed. Again, I've only seen 2 facilities, but LM is a cube-farm culture. \r\nIf you have issues with allergies, I would seriously warn you - I have issues with dust and the amount of musty old carpet/furniture/uncleaned airducts in my building was dreadful for my allergies. This is another unfortunate side effect of working in Secured environments. Not just anyone can come and clean the areas, meaning they don't get cleaned often.\r\n\r\n5. Agile. They say they are. They aren't. You might use agile tools (more likely SAFE tools - ugh) like Atlassian/Jira (more likely version one - ugh). But you are in no means Agile. Defense contracting comes with hard deadlines and expectations. That's not Agile in the slightest. So expect to work long hours or put together shoddy code before being able to renegotiate or discuss requirements. Higher up management will openly admit that they aren't Agile, and instead use some terrible waterfall mutant. You can expect daily scrums, but the usefulness of these is questionable since some teams are waaaay too large. I was on one scrum team of 13 people. That's incredibly too large to do scrum properly.\r\n\r\n6. Company culture. This is really more of a personal thing, but you should fully expect to have company values and culture shoved down your throat all the time. The amount of \"Inclusion\" and \"Being a Partner/Advocate\" articles on the front page is astounding. You'd think the company actually had an issue with these things, but they really don't - show up and do your job well, no one cares. You're doing well. Your ethnicity/persuasion/preferences shouldn't matter at all in this industry, just if you can do your job. It honestly feels like the company is attempting to put it's own agenda onto all of it's employees, regardless of how you might personally feel about a subject. I don't care for that.\r\n\r\nTLDR: If you're a software engineer, I would only look at Lockheed seriously if you have some fascination with defense work. If you have even the slightest bit of doubt, I wouldn't recommend it.

I feel if you have gotten a good performance review for each year, you should be moved up a level, but that is rarely the case.

If you're going to work for LM, be sure to negotiate aggressively before accepting the job offer.  From what I saw, management was always willing to negotiate and there was a lot of variation in what employees with the same job made salary-wise.  This variation had NOTHING to do with talent, hard work or qualifications and everything to do with how much you demanded up front.  Also, be confident during the interview process, especially when dealing with HR.  HR never seemed to know anything about the different departments, so if you sounded like you knew everything, they assumed you knew everything and moved you forward. \r\n-Once you're at LM, expect minimal pay increases that sometimes don't even cover cost of living.  \r\n-Their merit system is a joke.  On the plus side, if you just want to work your 40 hours a week and put minimum effort into your job and maybe spend time with your family, you can do that here and you'll get the same rating as that person working 80 hours who's always going above and beyond and who is a real team player.  However, if you're that 80+ hour team player, it doesn't work in your favor and no matter how hard you try, management will always find a reason to not give you that top rating.  \r\n-Non-functioning HR department.  Sometimes I was not paid, I did not receive my health benefits the first year on the job due to a \"computer glitch,\" and there were numerous other issues with actually using all the great benefits LM promises.  Numerous other co-workers, at least in my division, had similar issues, though none as bad as mine.  Basically, LM has a HR helpline that is expected to handle most of your HR issues, including issues with pay.  Some of these helpline employees really try, but they only have the most basic information and the whole process is reminiscent of the DMV.  For example, when I did not receive a pay check one week, I called my HR rep who told me to call the helpline.  I called the helpline and they told me to call the HR rep.  I went round and round until my manager and her supervisor, who were wonderful, stepped in and fought for several days to straighten out the situation.    \r\n-Chronic short-staffing.  This really depends on how the contract is structured.  Some contracts have it so that LM bills the client by the hour.  These jobs are very cushy and employees can take forever to get the job done.  Our contract was the opposite, we received a set pot of money to work with, so we had 50% of the employees we needed and that we had claimed we would have when we made the bid.  What this meant was long hours (sometimes 80-100, usually 60 hours a week), working on holidays (I worked Easter, Fourth of July, Labor Day, for example), and LM was always pushing us to work more while pushing us to be more 'efficient.'  At the same time, there were people in the unit who were playing around on the Internet all day, running off to Atlantic City unannounced for several days and who left early at 3pm most days.

It seems nearly impossible to get fired for poor performance, which I consider a very serious negative. When the dead weight is laid off from one program, another program picks it up. Operating this way, programs often overrun cost and schedule. Then the company expects its employees to work overtime -- often unpaid -- to make up for its mistakes. \r\n\r\nLockheed Martin claims to pay for performance, but high performance and high pay are not correlated. Working there as a high performer, you get the distinct impression of being taken advantage of. For example, working well above your pay grade and taking on additional responsibility aren't reasons to be promoted at Lockheed Martin.

The biggest issue with the culture is that management does not appreciate any new philosophies or anything beyond the status quo. This is ultimately stagnating progress at the company, and as such will have a hard time firing younger talent to replace the impending retirement wave. Most of the engineers want to fall into a leadership path because they see that it is the easiest way to make a good salary.

Once a product is launched, the program is over and you need to find something else to so. Sounds good and only benefits people with a good network.  On that same line, it doesn't matter how good you are at your job or what is on your year end review, if someone doesn't like you then you are screwed.\r\n\r\nThey also have been having a low retention rate of engineers (thats my field so I can only speak to it), a LOT of the ones that hire in right out of college leave between the 5-10 year mark when you get stuck in the ranks and have little hope of a promotion, that's where I am currently.  They are starting to push the older ones out by changing our benefits, which also hurts the younger ones.  Never trust a benefit that they sold to you to make the job seem desirable, its probably not as good as they claim and will be changed the next year anyways.

The following cons are made from a software engineering perspective.\r\n\r\nMajor Grievances:\r\n\r\n- Most of the company is living in the past. It is extremely difficult to acquire modern software for any projects. Therefore, it is difficult to keep up with the rest of the world in knowledge of software technology. \r\n\r\n- Mostly awful programming practices. Although there are a few rare individuals who care about good software, most of the engineers I have encountered write and heavily rely on unmaintainable, difficult to read, and bad code.\r\n\r\n- Very difficult to move to other projects. I found that it is very difficult to move to different teams despite what you hear from interviewers and management.\r\n\r\n- Culture of Complacency.  People have been doing the same thing for 20+ years and are very resistant to change. (Cshell, C++98, archaic version control tools, and more). Very difficult to make positive changes.\r\n\r\n- Moving up in the company based on seniority and not skill. You will meet lots of senior engineers that have been with the company for 15+ years who are at the skill level of a college graduate.\r\n\r\n- Noncompetitive pay. Your salary at Lockheed Martin will be significantly lower than having a software engineering position in any other company \r\n\r\n- Mediocre benefits. \r\n\r\n- Marginal raises. There is a fixed tier system that ranks you against the entire department. So even if you did great on your team, you will. probably be ranked low compared against the entire department. I got a 2% raise this year...\r\n\r\n- No bonuses, no incentives to work harder. Often, people get put in positions with increased responsibilities but with no increase in compensation.\r\n\r\n- Little to no training. The company has very little training and does little to teach you and help you improve as an engineer. I was lucky enough to meet one good engineer who mentored me but even this engineer left the company out of frustration.\r\n\r\n- Very low retention rate. Software engineers come in because of Lockheed's reputation and leave quickly out of frustration\r\n\r\nSmaller annoyances:\r\n\r\n- Little to no amenities. Pay for your own coffee. Pay for your own snacks. Some cool discounts available here and there.\r\n\r\n- Overtime Gate. Have to work a certain amount of hours of overtime before they start to count. Example: work 45 and you get no overtime. work 46 hours and you get 1 hour of overtime\r\n\r\nOverall, you can get lucky and be placed in a good team with good people. But the norm seems to be the opposite. For software engineers I would advise to skip this one and look for a job elsewhere."}], [{"review_title": "I worked for Lockheed Space Operations Co. for six years and moved up six times, ending as a Planner/Scheduler", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I got to work with everybody from applicants to engineers.

Corporate staffing manages and controls the contract work.  If possible, corporate positions are much more desirable than contract positions.  However contract employees make up the bulk of staffing at Lockheed Martin and, as expected, are very susceptible to the status of the contract. Employment is directly related to the health of the contract.  When a contract is in it\u2019s initial and execution stage, there is plenty of work and staffing naturally ramps up.  But during the closing or re-bidding of the contract, resources can and will be reduced in order to meet requirements.  I have personally witnessed staff members with 20 years of service receive 2 week notices with no warning.  You must be aware of your role, and don\u2019t take it personal.  Resources (including contract employees) must constantly be controlled in order to maintain the contract.  Generally speaking, most employment positions are safe along the life of the contract.  However during re-negotiations or the closing period, all mid to lower level positions, understandably, will be subject to dispossession with tenure not currying much favor.

Phone calls aren't returned, email conversations end after 2 exchanges maximum. (1 if exchanging with Finance.) Generally unfriendly atmosphere.\r\n\r\n3. Meetings rarely begin with introductions and it's easy to be sitting in a meeting and discover 20 minutes in that you are in the wrong meeting! (at least for the first few years)\r\n\r\n4. The overhead associated with accomplishing anything at all is staggering. One example is the performance evaluation system- Goals for the calendar year must be turned in by the end of March and results turned in by  mid-October so as to give \"the system\" time to process the inputs. This means your heroic sacrifices for the company during the major holiday periods will go unreported and you're being cheated out of 6 months of evaluation because the HR system overhead is so slow.\r\n  \r\n5. Internally developed systems for dispatching help or reporting broken stuff is slow to non-functional. If you really need something, you need to know  who does the work and go see them directly. Bring donuts and all will be well.\r\n\r\n6. Training consists entirely of \"compliance training.\" This is annual repetition of such things as how to fill out your timecard, what constitutes conflict of interest, export controls, workplace harassment, and all the hot-button HR stuff that a govt contractor has to do.   Actual work-related training courses are listed in the catalog but never held, or never held where you can attend. You can earn another university degree - on your own time of course if you want some training.\r\n\r\n7. Conversation with management is decidedly one-way. This is where the Talk is Talked. There are efforts made to have \"skip level\" communication sessions with 2nd level and higher management but no trust has been earned beforehand so one must pick one's words with great care.  I never attend these sessions because I fear that once I got started that I'd be leaving the very same day (note all my Con  points ).  They aren't hard to avoid - they are scheduled once a year en masse.\r\n\r\n8. Social engagement tools are advertised by the company recruiters but they have decayed into \"info wanted\" postings from the business capture folks.  No honest, meaningful dialog is happening because of likely negative consequences. No resemblence to newsgroups or usenet.\r\n\r\n9.

There are plenty of opportunities to learn and grow and the company places an emphasis on training and career development.  The people are for the most part friendly and people are always willing to mentor if you need help and guidance early on in your career.  \r\n\r\nIn terms of benefits, Lockheed Martin's benefits are above average but are not as good as they used to be.  One of the selling points used to be the pension program but now that that program no longer exists Lockheed Martin is not as attractive as it used to be.  However, there are other areas where the benefits are pretty stellar.  For instance, the company provides a generous tuition reimbursement program that will enable most people to get Masters or PhD degree without incurring any out of pocket expenses.  Also, the company reimburses for a gym membership up to $250 per year. \r\n\r\nWork/life balance is second to none.  Some people will complain about working a lot of hours, but I don't feel like there was ever any pressure to be in at work every weekend.  I know companies like SpaceX definitely have a stronger work ethic and there is more pressure to put in 60-70 hour weeks than at Lockheed Martin.  The saving grace if one does have to work a lot of hours is that overtime is paid after the first five hours.  LM also follows a 9/80 schedule which is nice if you need to get errands taken care of.", "cons": "As my review title states, LM is a great place to start your career, but it is hard to advance once you get to the Senior Level (roughly 7-10 years after a Bachelors degree).  Promotions are incredibly hard to come by after that period and there is no guarantee you'll get ahead even if you are a superstar.  This is due mostly to the fact that LM has gotten top heavy and there are too many experienced engineers taking up positions that should be available to younger more talented engineers.  Unfortunately, Lockheed Martin allows this complacency to happen and the company makes no provisions to push out mediocre engineers who aren't deserving of their jobs.  I've been held back promotions twice due mainly to the fact that my boss said my group was too top heavy.  You know a company isn't a good company to work for when your boss specifically states that the only way to get ahead is to leave and come back later.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that really stinks about LM is that they have this problem with having \"too many cooks in the kitchen\".  LM should be a lot leaner but as I said before, they are a bloated organization that refuses to get rid of underperforming engineers.  What ends up happening is that there isn't enough work to go around, and charge numbers can be hard to come by.  I've had to taken vacation time before because I didn't have a charge number.  Also, because work is so hard to come by, what ends up happening is that people make a career out of a task that should take a shorter amount of time.  LM is notorious for people working on a task for months on end just so that they have a charge number when the reality is that they should finish the task in a short period of time and move on.  \r\n\r\nI also really hated the negativity that surrounded this company.  When I was there, people would complain on a regular basis about the flawed performance management system and how they would get passed over for promotions time and time again.  I don't blame a lot of these folks but none of these people ever made the effort to actually leave the company.  If you want to get ahead sometimes you have to leave your cushy job and jump into a world where you have to prove yourself again and possibly be uncomfortable for a while.  Sometimes that is the only way you can get ahead.  Complaining daily about being passed over for a promotion doesn't help.\r\n\r\nTalented engineers end up either as managers at LM or they leave LM all together and find better jobs.  The rest of the crowd is content with having a job and as a result they underperform.  If you like working with mediocre people who are negative than LM is great but if you want to do things with your life and make a difference then I would suggest working elsewhere after you've had your initial experience.\r\n\r\nFinally, I appreciated my time there but not so much my management.  I'm sure this isn't true about every group but my managers were some of the worst people I've ever worked under.  It doesn't take much to hold a regular staff meeting or all hands so that your employees know what is going on.  Also, when a valued employee leaves your group, make an effort to attend their lunch or to do something nice for them.  Sadly, none of this happened and as a result, I never want to work for the company again.  That is fine, though.  I am much happier to work for a \"new space\" company and watch LM wither away like GM and Chrysler did in the Automobile industry.

I wish my manager had been more transparent about the client's management style so they/I could have found a better fit.
