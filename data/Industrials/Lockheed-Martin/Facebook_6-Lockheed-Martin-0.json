Management is a rotating cast of characters . People are constantly leaving for other better positions in the company. Ladder climbing is a real thing. It is hard to be friends with co-workers or technicians because of the constant push to get things done - everyone is stressed. Technicians commute in from far away and arrive at 4 am to avoid traffic. Support staff does not arrive until 6-7 am. That is where the resentment begins.
