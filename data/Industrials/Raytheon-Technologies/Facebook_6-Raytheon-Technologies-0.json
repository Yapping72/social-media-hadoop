All of the organization have been demanding an increase in salary because of the inflation rate growth, only for the CEO to send an email saying our concerns aren't legitimate, and to deal with it. It's nice to know your managers don't care about your concerns as long as their pockets are lined from fat bonuses. Since 2020 Raytheon can't retain employees due to their asinine COVID vaccine mandate and subpar compensation package. Many employees have left for competitors purely because of compensation, and Raytheon can't keep up with the losses. Save yourself the effort and look elsewhere for a position. If you have absolutely no other option, plan to stay here a year and run, that's what most do anyways. And if you were curious about the benefits, there's near none.

RTX of course complied with the Biden vaccine mandate but did so in a horrendous way.

The company has posted that anyone applying for a position that requires a religious exemption must provide a letter from a faith leader. That is disgusting, illegal, and immoral.\n- The company recently changed the pay grades as a result of the merger. This has removed promotion paths for mid-level employees. The positions still exist with more work and responsibility, but the company expects employees to take them for no additional pay where before one could get a promotion.\n- Company reaction to COVID has been abysmal. Employees are treated like children.\n- Leadership is just out of touch with their employees in general."}]]
