		"pros": "Great benefits, every other Friday off, fairly easy to follow work structure.",
		"cons": "Way more cons than pros, hence the 1 star.\r\n\r\nLets start with the management. It sucks and can make your life miserable. I had several managers over my years there, and you cannot hold them accountable for anything. You have a work from home arrangement with your prior manager? Well this one doesn't allow that. You work from 7am-3pm? Well this one requires 9am-5pm. Nothing is consistent and no prior arrangements are honored, usually. I had one manager honor all my past arrangements and he lasted all of 5 months.\r\n\r\nNext we can do the company culture. Never before have I seen such emphasis on inclusion and diversity to see the culture be the complete opposite. Many groups are established for black, Hispanic, disabled, LGBT, you name it. Then, you find out management is mostly a good ol' boys club with some pretty racist and sexist overtones. You can bring it up to HR, but they won't do anything unless you have some real damning evidence. If you lack that evidence, you'll also paint a target on your back. Basically the hypocrisy in middle management about implementing policies in made by upper management is laughable. \r\n\r\nNext is HR & Ethics. These groups mainly exist to protect the company and they don't care about you at all. If you are doing something, no matter how small and easily fixable it is, that could threaten the company, consider yourself on the way out. It is not unheard of for people to make anonymous claims to HR/ethics to get people fired. I've seen some older employees targeted because of small stuff, but they'll use whatever they can to terminate them.\r\n\r\nLastly is the career opportunities and pay. The pay is par, at best, for your location. Most other DoD contractors in the area pay more, but most aren't willing to get you a clearance like Raytheon is. It is entirely common for people to get their clearances and start looking for another job, because you can get a 20% increase by moving across the street. For your own job advancement, it is less about how well you perform and more about how long you have been there. When I was up for promotion, the first questions were \"You're over 30, right?\" and \"You have a masters, right?\". It was less about my actual evaluation and more about my time in the company. So if you're a high performer and expect to be promoted accordingly, look elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, this company exists for people who like a lot of structure, red tape, and overwhelming bureaucracy. If you became an engineer to be creative and have some freedom in your product, this isn't for you. If you're looking to coast to retirement, this company is absolutely for you. Bare minimum and becoming a number are the way to do things around here for many."

It reflects the change in values of the organization. Many of the managers I experienced were technically incapable and failing in leadership. The place is heavy with politics and backstabbing. Engineers are often stuffed in loud cubical farms. Funds are remarkably unstable and management, lacking in technical skills and understanding, often just drives schedule, overlooking and ignoring substantial technical failings."

I watched many great employees quit because they stayed in the same position for 10+ years and a new buddy of the manager would come in and get promoted after a year. Keep in mind this is just my experience with the program and is not a direct reflection of the entire company. There are, from what I hear, great programs within this program."

They constantly remind you that lunch does not count as work and want you to charge tot he nearest 6 minutes (never really enforced though, just threatened)\r\n-People are jerks. They yell at you for not knowing things despite the fact that the knowledge transfer is lacking. Even thought there is a wealth of information no one knows where it is. Oh, and if you happen to ask the wrong person a question you will get reamed out in a group email.\r\n-They put people where they need them, not based on the person's wants or interests. This severely stymied my career growth.\r\n-Their COVID response was and still is lacking. There was no effort made to get the people working in closed areas working remote. And they used thermometers comparable to meat thermometers to test if you had a fever.\r\n-Lower ranked people aren't listed too and publicly ridiculed if they make mistakes.\r\n-They could not have picked a worse time to merge with United Technologies: they merged during March of 2020 when COVID was at it's worse. Needless to say, I am not surprised at the numerous layoffs on the aerospace side of the business.\r\n-They censor out survey responses they don't like. This happened to my wife."

		"cons": "As the company grows, it becomes more and more bureaucratic and over the 10 years I've worked for Raytheon, I've watched communication go down the drain entirely, even in the smallest of groups within a program.\r\n\r\n- Overly complex management structure. Program managers, operations managers, supply chain managers, district managers, project managers, site managers, shipping managers. Literally everyone is a \"manager\" in Raytheon! It's insane. In our program of roughly 25 employees, more than 15 of them are \"managers.\" \r\n\r\n- Not keeping up with trends in organizational structure that other companies are adopting to stay competitive. I.e. Raytheon is still HIGHLY hierarchical and I believe this comes from the high amount of retired veterans and constant work with the government. They cannot let go of the military world and they bring it into the corporate environment. Not to mention, they all hire one another into their \"Good-Ole-Boy Club\", even though they have ZERO experience in the field (We literally have a former high school teacher and genetics engineer as the head of our quality department in a maintenance program). \r\n\r\nIn a world where decisions must be made quickly and competition is fierce with technology, Raytheon is lacking massively. A perfect example of this is it took 8 months for me to get a new laptop, even though mine was running on Windows 7 and being repeatedly locked out of Raytheon's own system due to being a security risk. EIGHT MONTHS. Emails went all the way up to our program manager, operations manager, IT department - no responses ever. No action. At least not until my computer was completely locked out of the system and I demanded IT to get me a new laptop.\r\n\r\n- Benefits are lacking for such a large and diverse corporation. Health insurance is the worst I've ever seen in the industry. Nothing but a health savings plan (HSP)? Really Raytheon? One single medical event and years' worth of savings are drained.\r\n\r\n- I've experienced more broken promises from management than kept promises. I've witnessed management tell an employee their job is safe and 6 months later call them up to tell them their position is being terminated. Not even a face-to-face meeting. HR emails them their severance paperwork, sign it, and done. Out the door they go after years of working for the company.\r\n\r\n- HUGELY understaffed projects across the entire enterprise. In a world of contracts, the bottom bid gets the win. So what does that mean when you can't cut costs in overhead? You cut from staff. We pile on many positions' worth of duties onto single individuals, and this creates more and more mistakes, burnout, and eventually loss in morale. People within my program who've worked for the company for decades have told me they've never seen Raytheon so low before. All we ever talk about is money - never the people, never the quality.\r\n\r\n- Meetings to have meetings to have meetings. My god we never stop having meetings. Doing our jobs with Bluetooth in our ears on mute, quite literally, all day long. Then after a meeting is over, individuals from the meeting call each other to complain about other people in the meeting and what a waste of time it was to have one another in the meeting. It's completely counterproductive and a total joke. Take some lessons from Elon Musk and cut the meetings. Meetings were created in a time when emails, texts, and instant communication didn't exist (you know, the 1950s). We don't need it anymore - period. I know managers that are literally paid to sit and have teleconference meetings - $100k/year salaried individuals to sit and have meetings. Talk about waste!\r\n\r\n- Massive lack of use of technology in my particular program. We are still doing bookkeeping with physical paper and typing in data that could be easily scanned with barcodes. Yet to \"justify our jobs\" we keep doing things like we did in the 1990's. Myself and other employees have researched and presented ideas for a more productive use of technology, only to be given excuse after excuse by upper management why we can't implement these tools. Our program won't even buy iPads to do inspections of equipment with because \"security is a nightmare.\" \r\n\r\n- Red tape. As mentioned above, bureaucracy. We have to get approval just to order office supplies - pens, paper, ink. I watched a former manager get written up because he purchased too much Windex at one time (making it a HAZMAT purchase - for a 5 gallon jug) and this was \"against company policy.\" What a joke. Are you serious Raytheon?\r\n\r\n- Lack of trust of employees. Management does not trust employees. Period. Hence the constant \"training\" and red tape that covers management's butts rather than investing in the employees.\r\n\r\n- Lack of trust of management. Employees don't trust managers. Managers don't reply to emails or phone calls inquiring about important business opportunities and needs. But god forbid you forget to fill out your time card - management will call you at 3:30am (because they're in another time zone) to make you fill it out."

The company doesn't seem to have a strategy to retain its top talent.   They don't seem to recognize that the market is hot and you have to pay people to keep them.   HR tries to substitute BS incentives for actual compensation - people see through that and move on.     \r\n\r\nFinally, there's the dreaded Raytheon laptop.

Excessive cronyism favoring the hiring and promotion of former military many of whom are incompetent at their jobs. Weak ethics department that does not act on serious workplace violations. Discrimination against the hiring of women in certain  overseas posts. Stingy vacation policy in hardship locations. Company willing to endanger personnel for the sake of profit. Recently Raytheon along with other corporations have found a way to shift their tax burden onto some of their employees. They company has been imposing  a controversial payroll deduction that is innocuously called \"tax equalization\" . This is imposed on those working in tax free countries such as Saudi Arabia. The net effect is that it is less attractive now to work in such countries.  Unfortunately as a new employee you won't know this until after you've signed on with the company.\r\n\r\nCompany is severely bloated with various processes and bureaucracy in some areas that nothing gets done. For such a multibillion dollar company sometimes it feels like it is being run like a mom and pop operation."

They have a paid shutdown between Christmas and New Years Day.  Once you're in though, you can stay here for years and years; you may end up doing the same stuff day after day, year after year but some people like that.",

Work life balance really depends which team you work with; example - some groups work a 9/80 shift meaning they are supposed to get every other Friday off yet this rarely happens as they are always trying to meet irresponsible deadlines.   Promotions are challenging as the most an employee will receive is a 5% salary increase, regardless of how well their reviews have been and with the realization they can get more $$ from somewhere else.  HR is not visible to employees."

		"cons": "My experience with the company has been pretty bad thus far.  During my interview I was told that I would have the opportunity to shadow Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) that were near retirement to help retain that knowledge.  I felt like it was a great opportunity to expand my own knowledge base and to take the next step in my career\u2026boy was I wrong.  I started and ended up sitting in a cube with no direction, other than mandatory training, for several weeks.  I never had the opportunity to work with any of the SMEs and for eight months I was bounced from one charge number to the next.  Come to find out, there were no real plans for me, other than to poach me from a competitor.  On two different occasions my manager asked me to apply to other positions within the company.  I finally found work, on my own, and have since transferred departments.  \r\n\r\nThings have gotten better in the new department, I am told that I am one of their highest performers, and will be up for promotion soon.  The bad part here is the raises and promotions.  Raises have been 2-3% for a while from what I\u2019m told and the promotion comes with another 2ish% on top of the normal raise.  That\u2019s not very much in my opinion for amount of responsibility that comes with the next position."

That may seem harsh, but this is the facts.  Personally I look at as I'm building equipment that will help protect our troops and freedoms, but however you feel about it, you are going to have to come to terms with it, best you do so before you start.\r\n\r\nThe second con:  Many things  you do are going to be classified which means A: you can't really talk about it and (more importantly to me) B: there is a lot of red tape to deal with.  You will spend some time waiting for this, that or the other piece of paperwork to be processed so that you can actually start doing your work.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think these are minor issues to deal with vs the pros of working for a  company that actually seems to care about their employees but that is very much a matter of perspective, everyone is going to have to make their own call."

You can get stuck on programs for a long time. My management has been very flexible with the hours and the days that I work. I really, really like that. My immediate managers (function, program, etc.) are all pretty decent people and respectful of their employees.  The pay is pretty good too. I got a pretty big jump when I left my old aerospace company to join Raytheon a few years ago.",
		"cons": "Like I mentioned as an aside in the \"best reasons\" you can get stuck on a program for a long time. But, if you are proactive and find something you want to work on, management is pretty good about helping you transition into new jobs. I think that the functional organizations are a mess too. I'm in a section that just had a bunch of leftovers thrown into it that they couldn't find another group for. I'm the only one of my particular specialty in the group, so I don't have any more senior people to go to for help with my job."

There is definite room for growth in your career at Raytheon if you want it. You really need to make it known that you are trying to advance your career and be proactive in making it happen. They do a lot of fun things like popcorn Wednesday and Monday madness to keep work interesting. They also have a lot of programs to get involved in like Active for Life.",

This means that the majority of the work is done by a very select few people and these people aren't getting recognized for their hard work. Also, because everyone has been working there for so long, there are a lot of personal relationships that get in the way of work. Some managers will give merit increases to the employee they think needs the money the most, not the employee that works hardest. This is incredibly frustrating."

Even with long term employees, pensions were capped, severance pay was discontinued, and  profit sharing  went away and are no longer given to new employees. I thought this was crap and long time employees should have been grandfathered. Management is usually not very good and pretty much tells you what they need to at the time they are talking to you. Training is normally not given because the Government won't pay it so it means Raytheon won't pay. My opinion may be for just the division I have always been in and other divisions or contracts may be better within Raytheon, but from the ones I've been on, this is my experience. In the end, it is a huge company where you are just a number. Raises are 1-3% which is crazy knowing what the CEO makes ($14M +).

You will be hopping from one project to another depending on how well the contract is progressing and how well the politics is at D.C.\r\n- Very little development and focus on new technologies \r\n- Little to no room for creating new software and innovation: you will mostly work with troubleshooting and tweaking existing software\r\n- Middle management can micro-manage at times.\r\n- Hard to advance to higher positions in the technical area\r\n- Can sometimes focus more on finishing a product within a budget rather than working carefully to create a quality product"

If you want to look for a different job, you have to sell your house and move to another city or state.\r\nInnovation is dangerous.

Those that perform above and beyond are consistently rewarded with \"On Target\" reviews while management continues to tell us its only a technicality, telling us we are the highest performers. Meanwhile, raises are based on performancex not even convering inflation. Upon talking to HR, they could not help me as I was simply \"On Target\". Compression raises were given last year, only for those of us that were passed on promotions anyway to be told we were not eligible as we were in higher company quartiles for our salary grade. New employees are consistently brought in making more than cleared engineers with more experience, only to sit and do nothing while awaiting clearance. Upon getting cleared, despite having had work and excelling at it while uncleared for almost a year (something rare), I was told I was not eligible for a better rating as I had only just gotten my clearance. This company rewards mediocrity and chases away good engineers that care. I could sit around like my more successfull (by Raytheon metrics)peers and do nothing but surf the internet and proceed through the ranks of Raytheon, but I have too much self respect. I can't wait to start applying for other positions, of which will recognize my worth as an engineer, and actually challenge me."

In California, the engineers are treated like the technical talent that they are...plenty of training opportunities, many major contracts requiring a wide variety of specialties, plenty of room/opportunities for growth and advancement.  In Texas, the engineers in SAS are treated as though they should feel lucky to have decent paying jobs.  The Texas organization is very top heavy (lots of engineers with 20+ years of experience) making it very difficult for junior engineers to advance.  You basically have to wait for the older people to retire.  There are no opportunities to learn new skills as there is no training budget for Texas.  Also, most of the programs are production type programs, so if you are a design engineer and/or are looking for development programs, skip Texas and go to California.  Maybe the super cheap cost of living in Texas makes management apathetic to the needs of their employees.  In California, I guess they realize people aren't going to stick around in a high cost of living environment unless they are treated well."

I do that because I think this division of Raytheon would still be fine for a short stint of say 2-3 years.  Plus my situation was probably a bit more extreme than normal.

The general short-term nature of projects in comparison to other Raytheon business units allows engineers to see the entire process quickly - making advancement and growth easier to obtain than other business units.  Management is very responsive to employees who do good work and are looking to grow.  The relative size of most programs makes it easy to stand out.",

Pay at RTSC is less than similar positions at other Raytheon Business Units.  RTSC's low cost structure results in a relatively flat management structure, making this a difficult place to bridge from engineer to manager.  Product development spending is light, which makes it easy to shine if you do work on your own, however, this is not the place to work if you are a research oriented engineer."

Their review process is a joke as it is setup that you cannot refute anything that is said in it, which is what they want because as long as they want you, you will get  reviews saying how everything you are doing is fine or great.

They had no follow-on work and did not prepare themselves for the possibility they may lose the contract. When I left, they had few engineers to actually develop the technology they needed to compete for future work. With the proposed merger, it would not surprise me if this business was closed down as the revenue drop has been significant. \r\n\r\nDespite their mistakes, most of executive management kept their jobs. Anyone who was close politically with management and who had been there for years kept their jobs. Some people have even received promotions. Essentially, they fired everyone not close to management and used the savings to enrich themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is not an organization a technical person should be a part of. There are no opportunities to learn and grow and it can be difficult for you to transition to another Raytheon business, many of which are more manufacturing or systems engineering-oriented as opposed to sustainment.

(I am hoping to see the merger into Raytheon Technologies bring some of UTC's decentralization and brand diversity to moderate these trends.) To be fair, strong management is an enabler for world-class predictability, which is critical in defense markets and especially with things that go boom.   Full disclosure: at the end of the day, I am retaining my stock holdings as Raytheon Technologies' future is bright.

Hours are very flexible for the most part, and employees start out with 100 - 120 hours of PTO, progressing to 160 hours at 5 years of employment.  Employee demographics are quite diverse and the workplace is pretty PC.  Perhaps most important, salaries are very competitive, particularly for entry-level employees.",
		"cons": "The average age of employees is over 50, which generates a lot of bureaucracy, and most processes are set in stone despite Raytheon's extremely active Six Sigma program.  Also, entry-level employees often end up doing odd jobs here and there for some time while management decides where they should be placed.  Many, many employees are ex-military, so if you have no military experience, you can sometimes have a hard time fitting in or understanding the lingo or culture.  Despite competitive salaries, HR is rather non-negotiable.  Acronyms are everywhere, and it can take weeks or months before you understand them all, and people throw them around like you should know them already."

		"pros": "Generally, most of the software system programs tend to be command and control oriented with very little web technology related work. Most of my peers were generally very competent with some being extremely sharp and creative. On low intensity programs, the low-level managers were usually very supportive of a balance between work and life. For me, most of my experience has been in using core language features of Java and c++ in application servers. Corporate leadership appears genuinely concerned for the employee quality of life and work and tries to seek a good balance between it and meeting the customer's needs.  The company benefits are very good as far as medical, dental, vision, disability, life insurance, and 401k.",
		"cons": "Depending on your background, you could be pigeoned-holed into one type of position, with very little chance of cross functional opportunities, as in going from software test engineer to software engineer and vice versa. Since the company is heavily dependent on defense spending, there is usually a strong correlation between cuts in defense spending and a lack of jobs. On high intensity programs where the delivery schedule is tight, expect to work alot of overtime.  Business level and program level management tends to be more focused on meeting bookings and profits with very little time spent interacting with the employees."

The paid time off (PTO) system is barely adequate: 3 weeks for 1-4 years with the company, 4 weeks for 5-10 years then a day or two for every additional 5 years.  The 9/80 schedule is great when you are able to use it.",

Traditional advancement is not effective in a company this large one must apply to jobs in lateral opportunities to advance. It is true; you are just a number."

Most of what you would learn here is only good here.  Non-transferable (to the commercial world) skills and experiences.\r\n- Company is self important.

One incident of slow response to a floor problem and some managers cancel it for months.\r\nValuing 'get along, go along' over everything else means there is no innovation; the nail that sticks up gets pounded down. \r\nWhen there is a bad manager or bad engineer, they often punish the careers of the first 3-4 people to complain rather than the perpetrator.

Sometimes the \"laid back\" atmosphere can get very boring when there is no work or very drab work that you are handed.

		"cons": "It is a matrix management organization divided to functional and program organizations.  However, functional division causes departments to become short-sighted and provincial, leading to incompatible work styles and poor communication.  There is little communication between functional and program orgganizations.  IF you are brought in to work with functional organization, you will be surprised in having difficulty to fined a long term assignment within the programs.  There is always a fear of being laid off if you are not part of a program org.   Functional managers have difficulty to keep their employee employed. The company is moving away from engineering inovation and diversification. The bulk of business is reduced to product maintenance and depot. There is little room for new design and development.  Performance evaluations are full of harsh criticism.  It is not a positive environment to work and build your career."
