For instance, cutting back on the terms of their retirement and pension plans for senior employees without warning. So much for it pays to be loyal. Its just an observation and does not effect me - I am a millennial with less than 5 years of experience.\r\n\r\n- From my experience, there is a strong stigma against relatively early career employees handling any kind of increasing responsibility.

The merger is a takeover. The skills, innovation, thought and insight of the former Raytheon employees has been brushed aside to be led by multiple consulting firms. Book expertise is what's changing this company. Real world application is now a thing of the past. Pooling resources instead of building skills. Disconnect and inconsistent messaging and communications to employees. 10% pay reduction for parts of the company and mass layoffs elsewhere, including Pratt and Rockwell. Change is good, yes, but this feels like the real life version of the movie Annihilation. Forecast for career advancement and truly building a skillset are slim. Compensation is taking a hit from \"Covid\". Work/Life balance is decent but only if you have a manager who believes in it (policy is one thing, but everything is manager discretion). Senior mgmt is self-absorbed and is well versed at lip service. There is a clear disconnect between what sr mgmt says and what we all experience day-to-day. Culture and values are changing and not necessarily for the better."

		"pros": "Depending on where you are and the team you\u2019re on, Raytheon can have a small company feel. Teams can become very close. The work is challenging and provides a sense of purpose.",
		"cons": "Raytheon keeps coming up with new changes to make working there not worth it. Salary is no longer competitive with other companies. Depending on the group and your manager you will never get more than a merit raise. Benefits are awful. This company has the worst 401k match of any company I\u2019ve ever known and they really try to make it seem like it\u2019s a great offer. Medical benefits are also high deductible only and will keep getting worse every year.\r\n\r\nThe company does not believe in rewarding hard work, they believe in rewarding niceness. Leadership in this company is some of the worst I\u2019ve ever experienced in my career. Management is so concerned about \u201cpersonal brand\u201d and not offending anyone that they will let people who are HORRIBLE at their job remain in their position while continuing to try to train them on knowledge they should have but can\u2019t retain. This puts a lot of strain on other employees as it causes them to have to pick up slack for extreme under performers with zero recognition. I know I\u2019ve put in many, many 12-16 hour days trying to clean up bad work and hold the hands of these employees while management does nothing or continues to try to be overly delicate.\r\n\r\nNow that Raytheon has merged two existing midrange levels in the organization, those people who fell in the lower of the two pay grades will have to wait years longer to be considered for promotion and, as mentioned before, will not receive any considerable raises in the meantime.\r\n\r\nRaytheon also will not give a merit increase to match inflation in areas that have experienced significant cost of living increases suddenly after covid. I was told by management since they were \u201callowing\u201d me to work remote that I could just leave my home and move to a different state because it wasn\u2019t the company\u2019s problem that the cost of living in the town which I resided even before hire increased by 25% in one year. I was offered a suggestion to quit or move to another team because moving to another team would allow me to negotiate higher pay. I had started my career with this company in a town where, when I started, the pay matched the cost of living in the area, we lost a contract and I was forced to move into a different group in a more expensive city. I offered to move to the city and was told no because they didn\u2019t want to give me a cost of living increase. Then after covid, the cost of living in the town I reside increased to match that city and management refused to give an inflation increase while encouraging me to look elsewhere for employment. I asked what I could do to earn a significant increase and was given no direction.\r\n\r\nAlso note if you work from home, you will work far more hours than you ever did working in the office. Management is out of touch with actual time it takes to complete tasks and gives unrealistic deadlines while piling on more work. On a weekly basis you never know what your daily schedule will look like. I\u2019ve worked 9-5, 9-10, 9-5 and then would have to take care of other home responsibilities and would work 10-2 or 3 AM. This was a very regular occurrence. If you work from home with this company you are basically on call and will never have a life outside of work.\r\n\r\nOne year ago, under my old group, I would have given the company 4 stars. Now I\u2019m only giving it 2. Don\u2019t work out of the Aurora office if you can avoid it. They are very out of touch with best practices in the industry and behind most other groups in the organization."

I moved across the country to work as an Embedded SW as that was what I applied to, and discussed during interview. \r\nOnce here, you get put on a random program until your clearance comes through which is fine. BUT after that you WILL get put into ANY program because \u201cbusiness needs\u201d. Yes, I am in a program completely and 100% unrelated to what I signed up for. \r\nI\u2019m not even using the programming language used in this field which means good luck leaving the company to get into the field you want to without long hours of studying and proving that you can do it to future employers. Other SW engineers will know what this is, but several of my pull requests have been up for a few months now. Barely any comments, and I messaged other people to look at it several times already. Nothing. \r\nThere was also an employee survey so that they send out so they can make their employees \u201chappy\u201d by putting them onto their career path and interests. Lmao this is the funniest part ever because it\u2019s NOT true. My program manager admitted they didn\u2019t even look at it when I asked them. If Raytheon wanted me to be a happy employee, maybe, I don\u2019t know, but just maybe give me the work I signed up for?\r\nRaytheon knows they have a retention issue. Instead what they do is tell you to pretend to be happy and lie to new hires about it because it\u2019s all about \u201cperception\u201d. \r\nOh but what about this \u201cyou can transfer to a different program if you want\u201d? LOL. I told my managers several times already that I do not like this program and it\u2019s absolutely unrelated to my field and the job title I signed up for. They\u2019ll listen and nod, fake a smile or two, then tell you \u201cwe need you because of \u201cbusiness needs\u201d.\u201d Literally their favorite words.\r\nI almost forgot to mention.. the other new hires I spoke to want to do work that they signed up for but they can\u2019t because \u201cbusiness needs\u201d and they were toss into any program. They also tried complaining this wasn\u2019t their interests but again it fell on deaf ears. \r\nAs for bonuses? WHAT A JOKE. Small measly 3% increase per year when inflation in 2020 was 5%. \r\nThey\u2019re also frustrating the senior engineers by changing their benefits and moving them to a cheaper program. How amazing. \r\nThere are A LOT of new hires that are all doing nothing. Remember how you were applying like crazy in hopes of getting a job? Well here it\u2019ll be the same way. Think about it. A ton of new hires, and they\u2019re all toss randomly into different programs. Then when you want to transfer because you\u2019re not interested, you get told \u201coh we\u2019re sorry all the other programs are full or they aren\u2019t looking\u201d. Instead they will tell you to join various groups to network. Hilarious. \r\nDo NOT, I repeat, do NOT fall for their hybrid or temporary assignment LIES. They will tell you it\u2019s hybrid at first where you come in twice a week but then all of a sudden it\u2019s 5x a week. The managers said my program is temporary until the end of July. Guess what I\u2019m still here. They told someone else theirs is December. Now the talks we\u2019re hearing is that it\u2019ll be some time next year in \u201822. They will delay and delay time and time again. \r\nAs a person and a new grad with less than a year of experience, I\u2019ve already started looking for a new job at month 5.\r\nIf you do decide to join, then go ahead and put on a Clown makeup."

You'll have to learn to stick up for yourself and not be walked all over\n- The last straw for me was when my boss criticized me for sending out emails at 4:00am instead of saving them for when everyone logged on in the morning.

		"job_title": "Proposal Analyst in Los Angeles, CA",
		"duration": "N/A",
		"pros": "Employee benefits (healthcare sucks, dental is pretty iffy too, but 9/80 schedule, education program, and retirement matching is nice. Also it's not advertised clearly and hard to find, but they have a deal through ComPsych for 8 free therapy sessions per year which many of us have had to use). \n\nBig name company so after a couple years you can apply elsewhere. Before starting, I knew three people who used to work at RTX. Two were older people who were fired right before they started really reaping the benefits of their long-term service (which is actually really common I'm hearing for \"sudden layoffs\" so RTX doesn't need to pay employees for their service). The other quit because he hated it so much and told his female daughter he would not pay for her schooling if she worked at RTX later on because he hated how the company treated employees. Why is this in Pros? Because with a big name company, you can leverage the name to apply elsewhere. \n\nOld fashioned company where quantity of years of experience is valued greater than quality of experience and knowledge. Basically, I've known people who do the bare minimum and so long as they wait two years at each level of position, they'll move up. If you want to coast by and move up regardless, this can be beneficial. \n\nPay is standard. I know a lot of people who are complaining about being underpayed, and they by no means pay a lot, but it's enough for me to share a one-bedroom apartment with only one roommate for an entry-level job. Got my first salary raise after one year (was told to expect 3%, got 3%, which was less than inflation in my area). Still, could be worse. I definitely would prefer to have my own place, and have it not be in the worst part of town. I also recently found out that I am close to the bottom quarterile of pay range for a P1 despite my crazy hours and hard work and when I tried to speak to HR about pay after receiving the offer letter was firmly told the whole offer was non-negotiable. I guess the Pro is that I'm able to pay for food and half of rent in my area.\n\nI'm sure it's a case-by-case basis, but I really like my team and manager. My manager really has my back and in some nasty emails has stepped up for me. Also they've been helping me look for other employment. My coworkers are willing to help as needed to get proposals out and so if one of us is sick, we're willing to assist while the other recovers.",
		"cons": "Company culture. On my first day there was a team meeting that quickly erupted into yelling. My manager called me afterwards to say \"well, that's engineering\" and try to laugh it off. I've never been a particularly angry person, but I've gotten into the really bad habit of hitting my desk when I get angry now (mostly from tech issues, because the RTX VPN and laptops they give out are absolutely terrible). The culture rubs off on you and it's really hard not to let it. \n\nAs the title says, everything is constantly top priority. Because of this, no one knows what to actually focus their efforts on so nothing gets done. I don't know if we've had a single proposal on time my entire time working for the company. Because of this, Program Managers will try to make deadlines earlier to give more wiggle room but those are unrealistic so they get missed too. Estimators will complain to us (proposal analysts) and all we can really do is say \"yeah this is really unreasonable, by the way where are X, Y, and Z, because the program manager keeps messaging me every 30 minutes asking for it\". Terribly understaffed to get anything done. \n\nManagement doesn't care. They have these \"Finance Town Hall\" meetings, where they explain the current state of the company and have RTX finance employees submit questions to management. At the last one, underpayment, lack of raises and promotions, mental health issues, and understaffing got brought up in separate questions. The Management's response for nearly every question was 'we are competitive for our industry' and 'this really isn't an issue'. It was extremely disheartening to have all of our concerns brushed aside so casually, but I guess that's par for the course. \n\nYou're working well past your 40 hour weeks. One of the benefits of being salary for most places is although you don't get overtime, you might run a little low on work some days and get to head out early if there's nothing really needed. The trade off of course is that if there's a lot to be done, you might finish late and work past the 40 hr week. At RTX though, the timecard is set up so you're at minimum working 40 hours every week, and unable to list more than 40 hours even if you worked it. At the end of every workday, you have to log in to the timecard and list everything you worked on that day down to the sixth minute (so 6 minutes would be 0.1). The kicker is, any time not spent working on a proposal (so checking emails, attending meetings, mandatory training sessions), must be charged to overhead. When your raise and bonus are calculated at the end of the year, if you have high overhead you will be penalized. So if you want your meager 3% raise, you have to not only work a minimum of the 40 hours (and the extra 20 minutes each day figuring out what you spent your time on), but also try to work past whatever you did during those 8 hours that was charged to overhead so you can instead charge the time to a proposal. Mind you, this is monitored extremely closely and we commonly get aggressive emails saying \"you charged 0.2 of an hour on this proposal last week. Explain what you did and CC who authorized your work\". My SO keeps saying I should go to the labor board about it because I'm consistently working crazy hours and getting upset calls and messages asking for things to get done, but RTX is clever and because it's not \"really\" mandatory for you to do anything, it just doesn't seem worth trying anything and sullying my name. I know how it might sound, but I'm really a hard worker and I believe in putting my all in my work. It's just disheartening and continually met with angry responses about it not being enough. Also, you're working with RTX groups across the nation and in different timezones. Don't hold your breath for them to think about what time it's by you. I started having to put my phone in \"do not disturb\" so I would stop getting calls at 4 in the morning, or late at night. If people feel so inclined to work at midnight (which happens far too often), it might be helpful to know not everyone else is. Also, you get the standard PTO package (2 wk vacation, 1 wk sick). You can only carry over 40 hrs per year though, and it does not get paid out - basically if you don't use it, it disappears. Unfortunately, this seems to happen for almost everyone I've seen at the company, including myself. During down time, my manager has recommended that we use PTO if we want to leave early in a day (even if the day before you worked 12 hours). So your \"vacation time\" is really not vacation. \n\nContinual mass exodus. Employees aren't happy and it shows. They have employee satisfaction surveys before our all hands meetings and for some reason they never show the results. About two months into me working at my position, a coworker asked dejectedly at a small meeting if there was any room for advancement in the near future. After being told no by our manager, he left that month. People are leaving left and right, and we aren't able to hold on to new people. We keep trying to hire for new positions, and the applicants either deny the offer, we get told overhead is too high and we have to freeze hiring, or the new hires leave right away. The thing is, no one blames them. It's become a celebration when people get to leave, and we send congratulatory messages and write recommendations. I've told numerous coworkers I'd happily be a reference for them, because people are working incredibly hard but not being met with benefits for it. \n\nTechnology is terrible and outdated. For a company with \"Technologies\" written in the title, you'd think (or hope) that you might not be forced to use Internet Explorer for 90% of the work. You'd be wrong though. We're all stuck on Internet Explorer, using a VPN that crashes every hour when the internet gets just a bit too slow, having Excel files fail to load and crash the whole laptop, etc. It's my biggest and most common frustration. Yes, I asked and got my RAM upgraded. The effect has seemed to be minimal. They have us on i5-8350Us and it's enough to make my SO laugh when they go over its specs. Also, many of the older employees are very tech-unsavvy and for one reason or another it has been falling on us proposal analysts to be their IT support. I had to screenshare with an engineer and show him how to COPY AND PASTE. The issue is, promotions are based on time rather than skill. He's been here forever and never needed to do it himself. People get so. lazy. As a proposal analyst you review basis of estimates. The amount of time I have spent opening a BOE to have it say \"error code XXXX\" submitted for approval because they didn't bother to proofread it, or have it be coherent until the last step where it says \"5 hours per month * 10 months = 742 hours\" so it lines up with their estimate and they don't need to revise drives me crazy. But for so many people, why would they put in effort to have it constantly be asked why A and not A+ when allowance is anything above a C. \n\nIncredibly frustrating work environment. I mean, I've worked fast food, labor, retail, internships, etc. and never really complained. This is just a terrible company to work for in my experience. I really didn't want to write a review, but my SO convinced me that this is the right thing to do, to help warn anyone hoping on making a long term career here. Some people thrive in this type of environment, I'm just not one of them."

The Leadership Language points towards MAJOR DOWN-SIZING in the next few months. Good Riddance. Better yet, avoid this company at all costs and your life & career will be much better off. There is absolutely nothing to be gained and everything to be lost in deciding to work for Raytheon. I regret this as the absolute WORST DECISION of my entire career, of my entire life. I am finally out (well, okay in two more days): AND I CANNOT WAIT! I have never had the feeling or experience before. Every company has something to offer. NOT RAYTHEON. They have NOTHING to offer. There is NOTHING - absolutely nothing - that any manager or role model can offer you here at RAYTHEON."

So\u2026 if the size paycheck is the most important aspect of your employment, Raytheon will likely meet your needs in this department.\n\nPerhaps what I did to earn my salary, to some, could also be considered a plus. During my entire time at Raytheon I never did the job I was hired for and basically spent most of my time (other than two very short temporary assignments) \u2026 awaiting clearance. So basically, I did next to nothing but was paid my regular competitive salary. That might sound great\u2026 but it got old very fast.",

I was hired for (promised) a position that I soon realized, did not exist/never existed. On my first day, a huge surprise to me, I was sent to awaiting clearance (which my entire career). As a note, any \u201csemi-competent\u201d company\u2019s security department could have had my SCI clearance activated in a few weeks.\n\nThe environment and culture were nothing like my time at Lockheed or General Dynamics. When the pressure was on (when true character is revealed), ethics went out the window. A cover-up culture to mask misconduct in middle management was both prominent and just as surprising, supported by all management. Needless to say, leaving Raytheon was one the easiest decision of my long career.\n\nIn other news\u2026 benefits and time off policies are nothing special and more in line with a 7-11 rather than other major defense contractors."

The company prioritizes DE&I, being woke, being green, and financial performance far before the warfighter. Raytheon builds technologies meant to defend the US and its Allies and destroy its enemies. It is deeply disturbing that the CEO of such a company would state that DE&I is his number one priority. I would think making sure that our products are the best they can be given that they determine life or death would be more important. I was wrong. The company culture since the merger has clearly gone hard woke left. Woke leftists will excel at RTX. Anyone else need not apply.\n- The company actively discriminates against white males much to its own detriment.\n- The company does not care about your rights under the law as an employee. RTX of course complied with the Biden vaccine mandate but did so in a horrendous way. Anyone who desired a religious exemption was asked probing questions which were the most egregious violation of the Civil Rights act I have seen in my lifetime. The company has posted that anyone applying for a position that requires a religious exemption must provide a letter from a faith leader. That is disgusting, illegal, and immoral.\n- The company recently changed the pay grades as a result of the merger. This has removed promotion paths for mid-level employees. The positions still exist with more work and responsibility, but the company expects employees to take them for no additional pay where before one could get a promotion.\n- Company reaction to COVID has been abysmal. Employees are treated like children.\n- Leadership is just out of touch with their employees in general."

There is also a significant difference between the incomes of people who gained employment at a given level and those who naturally tried to rank up. I have heard from many employees the process almost seems entirely random. \r\n\r\n- One can see the company slowly starting to trim spending on employees where they can. For instance, cutting back on the terms of their retirement and pension plans for senior employees without warning. So much for it pays to be loyal. Its just an observation and does not effect me - I am a millennial with less than 5 years of experience.\r\n\r\n- From my experience, there is a strong stigma against relatively early career employees handling any kind of increasing responsibility. Nearly all of management I have met expect one to work for several decades before you can even start talking about taking on additional responsibility."

You will learn a lot here about yourself, and how to work in teams (whether good or bad). Former UTC employees are consultants and used to working a contractor mindset (this is not a pro).",
		"cons": "Since the merger with UTC, I have not heard one good, positive, enthusiastic comment from anyone; be it from the now consolidated 2 businesses (had 4 last year and 6 in 2012) or the corporate entities. The merger is a takeover. The skills, innovation, thought and insight of the former Raytheon employees has been brushed aside to be led by multiple consulting firms. Book expertise is what's changing this company. Real world application is now a thing of the past. Pooling resources instead of building skills. Disconnect and inconsistent messaging and communications to employees. 10% pay reduction for parts of the company and mass layoffs elsewhere, including Pratt and Rockwell. Change is good, yes, but this feels like the real life version of the movie Annihilation. Forecast for career advancement and truly building a skillset are slim. Compensation is taking a hit from \"Covid\". Work/Life balance is decent but only if you have a manager who believes in it (policy is one thing, but everything is manager discretion). Senior mgmt is self-absorbed and is well versed at lip service. There is a clear disconnect between what sr mgmt says and what we all experience day-to-day. Culture and values are changing and not necessarily for the better."

We have bigger volumes of work compared to other sites with less employees. Employees frequently leave, causing high turn over rates because they can move to a competitive company for 10-50% more pay, then often coming back to Raytheon with higher pay for the same job because they like the work here, just not the low pay. Raytheon excels at hiring people on just to lose them in a year or 2 because the employee can get much better pay anywhere else for the same type of work.

Depending on the group and your manager you will never get more than a merit raise. Benefits are awful. This company has the worst 401k match of any company I\u2019ve ever known and they really try to make it seem like it\u2019s a great offer. Medical benefits are also high deductible only and will keep getting worse every year.\r\n\r\nThe company does not believe in rewarding hard work, they believe in rewarding niceness. Leadership in this company is some of the worst I\u2019ve ever experienced in my career. Management is so concerned about \u201cpersonal brand\u201d and not offending anyone that they will let people who are HORRIBLE at their job remain in their position while continuing to try to train them on knowledge they should have but can\u2019t retain. This puts a lot of strain on other employees as it causes them to have to pick up slack for extreme under performers with zero recognition. I know I\u2019ve put in many, many 12-16 hour days trying to clean up bad work and hold the hands of these employees while management does nothing or continues to try to be overly delicate.\r\n\r\nNow that Raytheon has merged two existing midrange levels in the organization, those people who fell in the lower of the two pay grades will have to wait years longer to be considered for promotion and, as mentioned before, will not receive any considerable raises in the meantime.\r\n\r\nRaytheon also will not give a merit increase to match inflation in areas that have experienced significant cost of living increases suddenly after covid. I was told by management since they were \u201callowing\u201d me to work remote that I could just leave my home and move to a different state because it wasn\u2019t the company\u2019s problem that the cost of living in the town which I resided even before hire increased by 25% in one year. I was offered a suggestion to quit or move to another team because moving to another team would allow me to negotiate higher pay. I had started my career with this company in a town where, when I started, the pay matched the cost of living in the area, we lost a contract and I was forced to move into a different group in a more expensive city. I offered to move to the city and was told no because they didn\u2019t want to give me a cost of living increase. Then after covid, the cost of living in the town I reside increased to match that city and management refused to give an inflation increase while encouraging me to look elsewhere for employment. I asked what I could do to earn a significant increase and was given no direction.\r\n\r\nAlso note if you work from home, you will work far more hours than you ever did working in the office. Management is out of touch with actual time it takes to complete tasks and gives unrealistic deadlines while piling on more work. On a weekly basis you never know what your daily schedule will look like. I\u2019ve worked 9-5, 9-10, 9-5 and then would have to take care of other home responsibilities and would work 10-2 or 3 AM. This was a very regular occurrence. If you work from home with this company you are basically on call and will never have a life outside of work.\r\n\r\nOne year ago, under my old group, I would have given the company 4 stars. Now I\u2019m only giving it 2. Don\u2019t work out of the Aurora office if you can avoid it. They are very out of touch with best practices in the industry and behind most other groups in the organization."

I moved across the country to work as an Embedded SW as that was what I applied to, and discussed during interview. \r\nOnce here, you get put on a random program until your clearance comes through which is fine. BUT after that you WILL get put into ANY program because \u201cbusiness needs\u201d. Yes, I am in a program completely and 100% unrelated to what I signed up for. \r\nI\u2019m not even using the programming language used in this field which means good luck leaving the company to get into the field you want to without long hours of studying and proving that you can do it to future employers. Other SW engineers will know what this is, but several of my pull requests have been up for a few months now. Barely any comments, and I messaged other people to look at it several times already. Nothing. \r\nThere was also an employee survey so that they send out so they can make their employees \u201chappy\u201d by putting them onto their career path and interests. Lmao this is the funniest part ever because it\u2019s NOT true. My program manager admitted they didn\u2019t even look at it when I asked them. If Raytheon wanted me to be a happy employee, maybe, I don\u2019t know, but just maybe give me the work I signed up for?\r\nRaytheon knows they have a retention issue. Instead what they do is tell you to pretend to be happy and lie to new hires about it because it\u2019s all about \u201cperception\u201d. \r\nOh but what about this \u201cyou can transfer to a different program if you want\u201d? LOL. I told my managers several times already that I do not like this program and it\u2019s absolutely unrelated to my field and the job title I signed up for. They\u2019ll listen and nod, fake a smile or two, then tell you \u201cwe need you because of \u201cbusiness needs\u201d.\u201d Literally their favorite words.\r\nI almost forgot to mention.. the other new hires I spoke to want to do work that they signed up for but they can\u2019t because \u201cbusiness needs\u201d and they were toss into any program. They also tried complaining this wasn\u2019t their interests but again it fell on deaf ears. \r\nAs for bonuses? WHAT A JOKE. Small measly 3% increase per year when inflation in 2020 was 5%. \r\nThey\u2019re also frustrating the senior engineers by changing their benefits and moving them to a cheaper program. How amazing. \r\nThere are A LOT of new hires that are all doing nothing. Remember how you were applying like crazy in hopes of getting a job? Well here it\u2019ll be the same way. Think about it. A ton of new hires, and they\u2019re all toss randomly into different programs. Then when you want to transfer because you\u2019re not interested, you get told \u201coh we\u2019re sorry all the other programs are full or they aren\u2019t looking\u201d. Instead they will tell you to join various groups to network. Hilarious. \r\nDo NOT, I repeat, do NOT fall for their hybrid or temporary assignment LIES. They will tell you it\u2019s hybrid at first where you come in twice a week but then all of a sudden it\u2019s 5x a week. The managers said my program is temporary until the end of July. Guess what I\u2019m still here. They told someone else theirs is December. Now the talks we\u2019re hearing is that it\u2019ll be some time next year in \u201822. They will delay and delay time and time again. \r\nAs a person and a new grad with less than a year of experience, I\u2019ve already started looking for a new job at month 5.\r\nIf you do decide to join, then go ahead and put on a Clown makeup."

		"pros": "Employee benefits (healthcare sucks, dental is pretty iffy too, but 9/80 schedule, education program, and retirement matching is nice. Also it's not advertised clearly and hard to find, but they have a deal through ComPsych for 8 free therapy sessions per year which many of us have had to use). \n\nBig name company so after a couple years you can apply elsewhere. Before starting, I knew three people who used to work at RTX. Two were older people who were fired right before they started really reaping the benefits of their long-term service (which is actually really common I'm hearing for \"sudden layoffs\" so RTX doesn't need to pay employees for their service). The other quit because he hated it so much and told his female daughter he would not pay for her schooling if she worked at RTX later on because he hated how the company treated employees. Why is this in Pros? Because with a big name company, you can leverage the name to apply elsewhere. \n\nOld fashioned company where quantity of years of experience is valued greater than quality of experience and knowledge. Basically, I've known people who do the bare minimum and so long as they wait two years at each level of position, they'll move up. If you want to coast by and move up regardless, this can be beneficial. \n\nPay is standard. I know a lot of people who are complaining about being underpayed, and they by no means pay a lot, but it's enough for me to share a one-bedroom apartment with only one roommate for an entry-level job. Got my first salary raise after one year (was told to expect 3%, got 3%, which was less than inflation in my area). Still, could be worse. I definitely would prefer to have my own place, and have it not be in the worst part of town. I also recently found out that I am close to the bottom quarterile of pay range for a P1 despite my crazy hours and hard work and when I tried to speak to HR about pay after receiving the offer letter was firmly told the whole offer was non-negotiable. I guess the Pro is that I'm able to pay for food and half of rent in my area.\n\nI'm sure it's a case-by-case basis, but I really like my team and manager. My manager really has my back and in some nasty emails has stepped up for me. Also they've been helping me look for other employment. My coworkers are willing to help as needed to get proposals out and so if one of us is sick, we're willing to assist while the other recovers.",
		"cons": "Company culture. On my first day there was a team meeting that quickly erupted into yelling. My manager called me afterwards to say \"well, that's engineering\" and try to laugh it off. I've never been a particularly angry person, but I've gotten into the really bad habit of hitting my desk when I get angry now (mostly from tech issues, because the RTX VPN and laptops they give out are absolutely terrible). The culture rubs off on you and it's really hard not to let it. \n\nAs the title says, everything is constantly top priority. Because of this, no one knows what to actually focus their efforts on so nothing gets done. I don't know if we've had a single proposal on time my entire time working for the company. Because of this, Program Managers will try to make deadlines earlier to give more wiggle room but those are unrealistic so they get missed too. Estimators will complain to us (proposal analysts) and all we can really do is say \"yeah this is really unreasonable, by the way where are X, Y, and Z, because the program manager keeps messaging me every 30 minutes asking for it\". Terribly understaffed to get anything done. \n\nManagement doesn't care. They have these \"Finance Town Hall\" meetings, where they explain the current state of the company and have RTX finance employees submit questions to management. At the last one, underpayment, lack of raises and promotions, mental health issues, and understaffing got brought up in separate questions. The Management's response for nearly every question was 'we are competitive for our industry' and 'this really isn't an issue'. It was extremely disheartening to have all of our concerns brushed aside so casually, but I guess that's par for the course. \n\nYou're working well past your 40 hour weeks. One of the benefits of being salary for most places is although you don't get overtime, you might run a little low on work some days and get to head out early if there's nothing really needed. The trade off of course is that if there's a lot to be done, you might finish late and work past the 40 hr week. At RTX though, the timecard is set up so you're at minimum working 40 hours every week, and unable to list more than 40 hours even if you worked it. At the end of every workday, you have to log in to the timecard and list everything you worked on that day down to the sixth minute (so 6 minutes would be 0.1). The kicker is, any time not spent working on a proposal (so checking emails, attending meetings, mandatory training sessions), must be charged to overhead. When your raise and bonus are calculated at the end of the year, if you have high overhead you will be penalized. So if you want your meager 3% raise, you have to not only work a minimum of the 40 hours (and the extra 20 minutes each day figuring out what you spent your time on), but also try to work past whatever you did during those 8 hours that was charged to overhead so you can instead charge the time to a proposal. Mind you, this is monitored extremely closely and we commonly get aggressive emails saying \"you charged 0.2 of an hour on this proposal last week. Explain what you did and CC who authorized your work\". My SO keeps saying I should go to the labor board about it because I'm consistently working crazy hours and getting upset calls and messages asking for things to get done, but RTX is clever and because it's not \"really\" mandatory for you to do anything, it just doesn't seem worth trying anything and sullying my name. I know how it might sound, but I'm really a hard worker and I believe in putting my all in my work. It's just disheartening and continually met with angry responses about it not being enough. Also, you're working with RTX groups across the nation and in different timezones. Don't hold your breath for them to think about what time it's by you. I started having to put my phone in \"do not disturb\" so I would stop getting calls at 4 in the morning, or late at night. If people feel so inclined to work at midnight (which happens far too often), it might be helpful to know not everyone else is. Also, you get the standard PTO package (2 wk vacation, 1 wk sick). You can only carry over 40 hrs per year though, and it does not get paid out - basically if you don't use it, it disappears. Unfortunately, this seems to happen for almost everyone I've seen at the company, including myself. During down time, my manager has recommended that we use PTO if we want to leave early in a day (even if the day before you worked 12 hours). So your \"vacation time\" is really not vacation. \n\nContinual mass exodus. Employees aren't happy and it shows. They have employee satisfaction surveys before our all hands meetings and for some reason they never show the results. About two months into me working at my position, a coworker asked dejectedly at a small meeting if there was any room for advancement in the near future. After being told no by our manager, he left that month. People are leaving left and right, and we aren't able to hold on to new people. We keep trying to hire for new positions, and the applicants either deny the offer, we get told overhead is too high and we have to freeze hiring, or the new hires leave right away. The thing is, no one blames them. It's become a celebration when people get to leave, and we send congratulatory messages and write recommendations. I've told numerous coworkers I'd happily be a reference for them, because people are working incredibly hard but not being met with benefits for it. \n\nTechnology is terrible and outdated. For a company with \"Technologies\" written in the title, you'd think (or hope) that you might not be forced to use Internet Explorer for 90% of the work. You'd be wrong though. We're all stuck on Internet Explorer, using a VPN that crashes every hour when the internet gets just a bit too slow, having Excel files fail to load and crash the whole laptop, etc. It's my biggest and most common frustration. Yes, I asked and got my RAM upgraded. The effect has seemed to be minimal. They have us on i5-8350Us and it's enough to make my SO laugh when they go over its specs. Also, many of the older employees are very tech-unsavvy and for one reason or another it has been falling on us proposal analysts to be their IT support. I had to screenshare with an engineer and show him how to COPY AND PASTE. The issue is, promotions are based on time rather than skill. He's been here forever and never needed to do it himself. People get so. lazy. As a proposal analyst you review basis of estimates. The amount of time I have spent opening a BOE to have it say \"error code XXXX\" submitted for approval because they didn't bother to proofread it, or have it be coherent until the last step where it says \"5 hours per month * 10 months = 742 hours\" so it lines up with their estimate and they don't need to revise drives me crazy. But for so many people, why would they put in effort to have it constantly be asked why A and not A+ when allowance is anything above a C. \n\nIncredibly frustrating work environment. I mean, I've worked fast food, labor, retail, internships, etc. and never really complained. This is just a terrible company to work for in my experience. I really didn't want to write a review, but my SO convinced me that this is the right thing to do, to help warn anyone hoping on making a long term career here. Some people thrive in this type of environment, I'm just not one of them."

So\u2026 if the size paycheck is the most important aspect of your employment, Raytheon will likely meet your needs in this department.\n\nPerhaps what I did to earn my salary, to some, could also be considered a plus. During my entire time at Raytheon I never did the job I was hired for and basically spent most of my time (other than two very short temporary assignments) \u2026 awaiting clearance. So basically, I did next to nothing but was paid my regular competitive salary. That might sound great\u2026 but it got old very fast.",

I was hired for (promised) a position that I soon realized, did not exist/never existed. On my first day, a huge surprise to me, I was sent to awaiting clearance (which my entire career). As a note, any \u201csemi-competent\u201d company\u2019s security department could have had my SCI clearance activated in a few weeks.\n\nThe environment and culture were nothing like my time at Lockheed or General Dynamics. When the pressure was on (when true character is revealed), ethics went out the window. A cover-up culture to mask misconduct in middle management was both prominent and just as surprising, supported by all management. Needless to say, leaving Raytheon was one the easiest decision of my long career.\n\nIn other news\u2026 benefits and time off policies are nothing special and more in line with a 7-11 rather than other major defense contractors."

Just remember, if they cared they would train you properly and since they didn't you just need to try to do your best and not get emotionally tied to the results of your work. I feel this is how everyone starts out in safety. This is a career that you can spend 5 years in and still only know 70% of what is going on.)\r\nGreat place to get your foot in the door but to receive significant raises you will likely need to company hop around (probably true for all defense contractors)"
