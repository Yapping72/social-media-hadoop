Zoom truly lives by it's mission of delivering happiness.\r\n\r\n*An absolutely fantastic company culture, the interview process is thorough and the result is a company of truly wonderful people who work to better the product, those around them, and themselves.\r\n\r\n*Zoom offers truly competitive salaries, & in my opinion an unmatched benefits program. Forma(formerly twic) salary stipends, RSU's, Comprehensive medical cover, BYOD reimbursement, In-office lunches, regular in-and out of office events, and more. Zoom is constantly expanding and reworking their benefits to ensure they stay relevant & competitive. \r\n\r\n*Flexible working hours and for the majority of roles, the freedom to work \r\nRemote, Hybrid, or in office. Zoom trusts it's employees to get the job done and gives them the tools to do it where they are most productive & happy.\r\n\r\n*Open and honest communication, and the best Senior leadership team i have ever worked under. Zoomies are encouraged to be open and honest with others and to share our ideas, and this is facilitated both in person & over our platform. In addition, the Senior leadership team at Zoom is absolutely incredible. In particular our CEO Eric Yuan is the kindest , most empowering & thoughtful leader I have ever worked for. \r\n\r\n*Ample opportunities for Career development. Zoom provides their employees with several tools to exponentially grow their skills & knowledge within their role. More importantly Zoom encourages and sets aside time for employees to have regular development chats with their managers, and discuss where they would like to see their career go, and how their manager can help them get there.\r\n\r\n*An excellent work-life balance. Zoom will regularly promote & remind employees to take time off & recharge, and in the shorter term we're encouraged to break up the working day, whether that's coffee with a coworker or complimentary guided meditation & workout sessions.\r\n\r\n*An inclusive and truly diverse workplace. Zoom truly and simply does not discriminate, and as a result we have a wonderfully diverse and beautiful team.", "cons": "The only Con to working at Zoom (internationally) is that it is a HIGHLY US centric company. With the majority of our employees & our Senior Leadership team in the US, international employees such as myself often have to work around several hurdles & will miss some opportunities that Zoom employees in the US have. For example, Zoom facilitates Daily events such as Yoga, Meditation, and full body fitness. This is an excellent initiative which i deeply support, however as an employee in Australia these are held at 1am, 2:30am, or 5:00am. Several of our company wide meetings also take place extremely late, or really early. \r\n\r\nWhile it is impossible to accomodate for every timezone with one meeting, seeing alternating schedules to suit employees in the US, EMEA, and APAC timezones would be a fantastic solution."}, {"review_title": "Nice company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible working style. caring employees.", "cons": "remote work style, less colleagues meet."}, {"review_title": "Can work from home but some brownnoser toxic colleagues make this place reek of nepotism", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Sales", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- WFH benefits - Nice few hundred claimable benefits -Most people are nice except for a few bad eggs - Good place to find work in if you've got a \"shady\" past, this company background checks are weeeeeeeakk asf.", "cons": "- Targets just keep rising - A few toxic brownnoser coworkers got hired by faking things in their CVs.

There is internal bullying - this is also overlooked because all that really matters to this company are numbers. So let's talk about numbers- if you hit 150% of your quota, the following quarter's quota will inflate by 150%. Zoom give quarterly quotas and they are not strategic in how they decide upon the targets. Its just whatever you achieved previously becomes your new quota. The hiring has become so aggressive despite the demand for Zoom dwindling that each person's territory is shrinking WHILE their quota is increasing. \r\nThere is no accountability. As an AE, you need to work closely with other stakeholders in order to Deliver Happiness to your customers. However, the culture at Zoom is very much one of 'passing the buck' or simply ignoring requests to collaborate which can seriously stall deals and ruin your opportunities to earn. People just don't want to help.\r\nYour territory will change every time someone new is hired. You will have to accept that you will lose accounts month by month despite any opportunities you are working on. If a rep is caught selling into your account, you will be advised to split the booking with them, so you must accept that your accounts will be worked by others. \r\nLeadership are fully aware of all of the above as most reps are totally honest in the Glint surveys.

Our benefit package is generous, although there's room for improvement (no matching 401k!)\r\n- Leadership Transparency: I love how regularly we hear updates from our executive team and appreciate their thoughtfulness in how they approach our All Hands and other meetings\r\n- Work/Life Balance: I personally feel like I have work/life balance. I'm encouraged to take time off and it's clear leadership cares about my mental health and wellbeing.\r\n- Flexibility: I appreciate how as long as I'm getting my work done, it generally doesn't matter from where, during what hours, etc. (within reason)\r\n- Focus on DEI: Zoom does a fantastic job supporting DEI with our various ERGs and associated events", "cons": "Here are some areas I think Zoom can improve:\r\n- Internal Processes/Cross-Collaboration: while I wasn't here during 'peak' Covid, it's apparent a lot of structure and organization internally was put on pause just to keep the lights on at the company. There's a ton of work to be done to streamline processes, make data more reliable/available, and generally speaking with how teams work together instead of rowing in different directions\r\n- Customer Centricity: linked to the above, all departments and teams should have goals/KPIs linked to customer success and customer happiness. It's very clear some departments care about the customer (particularly those on the front lines), while those behind-the-scenes often don't approach their work in a customer-centric way.\r\n- Career Progression: is very opaque for me. I've never worked at a company where there isn't a formal performance review process and I don't have a strong sense of how bonus/pay/equity decisions are made\r\n- Middle Management: insanely busy. I rarely meet with my manager and when I do, it's clear she's always distracted, not fully paying attention, and at times feels like she's using our time together to simply check the box. I wish we received more strategic vision/goals from our senior leaders.\r\n- External Company Vision: candidly speaking, we do a very poor job of marketing ourselves as a 'platform' company, which is what the entire exec team would tell you we are trying to become/currently are. Everyone knows us for our Meetings product because most have used it, but few are aware we have products outside of Meetings. We could do a lot better job of painting a picture to investors/prospective customers/current customers about how we position ourselves and product suite as a platform, not a single product.\r\n- M&A: what are we doing here? We clearly have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and the Five9 deal fell through. I appreciate the diligent approach to our financials, which has undoubtedly put us in the great position we're in today, but I actually question if we're being too stringent with our cash reserves?"}], [{"review_title": "Compensation is too low", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 May 2022", "job_title": "Account Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good company to work for", "cons": "The pay is awful and not competative with the rest of the market."}, {"review_title": "Truely one of the best places to work for!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Finance Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing company , growth and no politics culture.

Other than that HR is non-existence, almost forgot there is a HR function in this company. \n- Sales- Runs like SME, Wild Wild West, do what you want because no one cares as long as you hit your numbers. There are many rules in place but no one follows or even enforce them. The structure can just change without discussing with the team involved because the top management approved it as long as you pitch the right information he wants to hear. One of the messiest sales team. Many leaders are good in theory and storytelling, very few that really understand what is happening on the ground or maybe they don\u2019t even care at all as long as you deliver the numbers. Managers who set direction but always changed due to lack of confidence(capabilities) and pressure from the top.\n- Sales Ops- Does it exist? I thought they are interns that just know how to copy and paste excel sheets whenever people ask them to do so, a team with 0 values, database and account are in a mess and getting worst everyday\n- Operation- Billing, IT, etc, sometimes your questions or ticket logged will never be resolved. Everyone is pushing responsibilities because many of them are contractors. You will end up at a dead-end and not sure what to do next because even the expert in the department pushes it back to you.\n\nOverall:\n- No transparency in this company, any information you ask for will never have an answer, such as how we set our quota/target, how they evaluate the market, which data are we using etc. Structure and strategy can just change without involving or even communicating to the people who are affected. Top management can just decide and execute. You only realise the changes when it hit on your face.\n- Love to use the excuse of \u201cgrowing too fast\u201d, \u201cgrowing pain\u201d for not improving, nothing has changed, but many things turn out to be worst.\n- Too many millionaires in the company, they don\u2019t really care about the well being of the company, that\u2019s why no one will bother to feedback or make any changes. Those who can make changes don\u2019t bother as well since they are at the top and not affected.\n- Promoted many unqualified leaders\n- If you are from an old school company, a lucky person, good in theory and storytelling, good in politics, looking for a so called \u201cgrowing company\u201d, this will be the best for you.

I truly believe Eric Yuan has the BEST intentions and goals, but some of the other executive leaders coming in from other companies are carrying their intentions/ideas with them. Ryan for example adjusted the clawback period and extended it during COVID so that employees took huge hits on cancellations when we knew people were going to go up and down on subscriptions due to the state of the business. Bringing in Cisco and RC leadership has had a negative impact all around. Quotas appear to be mis-aligned and leadership seems to have forgotten that the Zoom Boom is over. You aren't supposed to miss quota, but supposedly they're also set so that only X% of employees hit, which doesn't make sense. No 401k Match right now. A lot of outside hiring was done for promotions available during covid rather than promoting within and starting brand new people at the bottom, which seemed like a slap in the face to Zoomies who have been here for years. There has been a lot of talk about going back to the office, which seems hypocritical given that we are THE work from anywhere company. There is a lot of uncertainty for employees here right now, which would be more understandable if we were any other company, but none of us should be forced into a hybrid option when we return. Leadership is not on the same page and some make it seem like you won't have a job if you don't return to the office, while others make it seem like remote work will be fine.

There's a lot more money to be made from any department member at Zoom if you want to make a 10 or 20 year career at Zoom.  Every employee at Zoom does make a difference internally and with how we are received by our customers. \r\n\r\n\r\nAS A SALES TEAM MEMBER:\r\n+High energy sales team in most offices, especially San Jose and Denver. We have high expectations for our team members to work hard, put in a solid 8 hours a day, and deliver customer happiness. What does customer happiness look like? It means getting on Zoom meetings with your customers/prospects and being able to solution sell the benefits of Zoom's meeting, room, and phone technology. Get a customer in a trial + have great follow up/customer service and you have a good chance of winning the customer over. The product sells itself!!!\r\n\r\n+There are so many resources to count. You have a dedicated Phone Product Specialist that will help you on any Zoom Phone deals and they have competitive info that can give our customers confidence in testing our phone product. Also, you have access to a solution engineer for any pre-sales opportunities so that you don't have to be technical with the product. We have partners who can help you through the channel of resell and hardware partners. We also have a dedicated CSM team that will help you train your higher paying accounts with training and onboarding.\r\n\r\n+Managers want you to be successful. They will not make every sales person happy but the good ones (there's a lot of them) will fight for you when it comes to quota relief, bookings, conflicts with other sales members, difficult customers, and escalating requests to leadership and other departments. My manager does all of this and more. She knows the strengths of our team and is always figuring out new ways to engage our team and connect us. Funny part about this whole COVID-19 and working from home is that our team is actually closer now than ever before. And this is because of my manager. She brings the best out of us.\r\n\r\n+As big as Zoom is getting, you still have access to leadership to help you. A simple ping and hop on a Zoom meeting with even our CEO is possible at Zoom. A lot of employees don't realize this. On top of this, our leadership team is very transparent in listening to our concerns.\r\n\r\n+Promotions are up for grabs every quarter. I've been promoted several times because I applied and prepared for my internal interviews with hiring managers. If you really want it and show through your work ethic and performance, Zoom will promote you and increase your income/salary/stock rewards.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCT:\r\n+It just works! Have you tested our competitors? Imagine if you couldn't use Zoom anymore? How devastated would you be in being able to get things done?\r\n\r\n+Zoom allows our employees to add/suggest/escalate product requests no matter what level position you have. We use a company called UserVoice to up or down vote product/feature enhancements and concerns. You can put in your own suggestion and it may find its place on the Zoom product roadmap. It's newly implemented in the past 6 months so I am excited to see what that looks like by the end of 2020.\r\n\r\n+We have an exceptional product that I believe some employees don't even realize. Many of our competitors do not innovate at the pace that Zoom does. Our engineering teams are working 24/7 around the world to develop Zoom. Our engineers in San Jose are the BEST in the world at what they do. I'd highly recommend every employee to visit our San Jose office and get a tour of the engineering floor.  Meet some of the men and women who work on the product and then talk to our product team led by Oded. You will be AMAZED to hear what we are working on.
