You might get hired for one team and then a more senior manager you had no interaction with might snag you to their dumpster fire of a team/product doing work you never intended to do when you accepted the offer. If giving 6 months for an entirely new team of people (80% of which are new to the company) to make significant progress on a legacy product and firing the new people when that plan somehow doesn't work out, and redoing that cycle multiple times sounds like a great place to work, then you might like it here. Plus you'll have no support from the teammates or management. If you have the experience, you can figure things out pretty quickly. The portion of the team that can't will be hung out to dry, no matter how much you try to help bring them up to speed. Opinions are set pretty quickly which means you'll have a team of 4-6 where 2-3 people are doing most of the work. They killed the Agile delivery job family, which I can understand why, but from my perspective was a terrible decision and will likely continue allowing bad managers to impose poor decisions onto their engineering teams which only cause more headaches and fires. You can push back and explain why continuing to make the same short-sighted decisions is bad long term, but if your manager can't take the heat from their manager it will just be constant pain for you and your team. Highly regulated industry which leads to release freezes, audits, and essentially no trust between coworkers/managers/teams. Waterfall veiled as agility because they \"do devops\" and \"have CICD\". Sure the release cycles can be pretty short, but call it what it is. Off-hours release windows with lots of manual intervention isn't utilizing the tools well. Tons of on call. Do you enjoy staying up until 6am after working a full day, then getting on the next day and doing it all again? How about not being able to handle personal affairs, not knowing day-to-day when you're working until? Do you like being a remote control for someone else to do work through? Do you want to get fired because that remote control culture means you're the one clicking the buttons because the HIPPO told you to? They're insulated by you being the one doing their bidding. Do you want to work with people that like to be busy for the sake of being busy? Do you like your manager kicking cans down the road until you're up against a tight deadline every day? The one senior person on your team that is familiar with Capital One or the project(s) you're working on is unlikely to have the skills to properly train, knowledge share, and onboard team members effectively. If you've led sustainable high-performing teams before, you'll have a lot to overcome to create that here. The manager won't make that any better. I haven't been fired, I'm still employed at Capital One when writing this review. All of this is based on what I've been told of past teams, what I saw when I came in, and what I've seen in the area I work. The whole experience has been a nightmare, I'd avoid at all costs.

We've access to all of Udemy's content for free.", "cons": "Where do I start? By far, the worst thing about Capital One is it's performance management process. There's is a company policy called distribution, I call it force distribution. This means, if a People Leader has 5 principal associates, and they're all high performers, one of the 5 direct reports MUST (underlined and bolded) be forced down to be ranked either as \"inconsistent\" or \"below strong\". It doesn't matter if you've glowing reviews or how hard you worked throughout the year, there's always a risk a high performer can be rated an \"inconsistent\" or worse \"below strong\" and there's absolutely nothing or no one you can take it up with. Capital One has an \"independent\" arm of HR called Associates Relations. Don't bother going to that department because per company policy documents \"the leadership team owns the performance review\". In plain English, that means Associate Relations can't do anything for you in that case. So be sure to ask pointed questions during your interview about performance reviews. If they said it's merit based, asked what about distribution. Literally, leadership will spend a total of 5 hours over a couple of days to stack rank associates against each other until they have the company required distribution of a couple or so individuals in below strong, a couple of so I'm inconsistent, 1-2 folks in strong, and 1 if any in \"above strong\". By the way, the employees being ranked are never invited nor allowed to attend these calibrations of themselves. Another con is that there's a ton of work depending on the team you're on. I went on rotation to their tech audit team and they just do A LOT compared to the rest of Audit. Think 20 page work papers for testing 1 control, writing from scratch all the everything. And most likely by the time those pages go through multiple level of reviews, you are so exhausted and brain fried. Also, some teams are not diverse at the top at all. So from director plus and up, it's one white men, and the low level employees especially the ones who do the heavy lift aka worker bees are mostly minority. You'll see a minority here and there in leadership but that's not the norm especially in Tech Audit. With all this said, there are some teams that are amazing. E.g., Compliance Audit, Agile Delivery teams in retail, etc. There's an opportunity to apply to a different department but it it's a 50/50. Btw, as soon as you hit \"submit\" on an internally posted job, your immediate manager is notified.

That said the training is very good and the staff who deliver it are competent and ensure that nobody is left behind. Again this is good for building confidence however the reality of the job is far more brutal than the training portrays.", "cons": "As someone who up had spent most of their working life in workshops, moving into the (barely) hybridized workspace of Capital One, has been an education in tolerance and how to manage my own expectations of a workplace which sells itself on its 'Culture' \r\n It's worth mentioning from the start that this role is not for people who struggle with confrontation and difficult conversations and it goes without saying that some people live to call complaints departments and enjoy arguments as they have little else going on. Others have some genuinely difficult and often heart-breaking situations surrounding debt and if having these conversations is not something you can tolerate in everyday life. This job is not for you. Furthermore, the products themselves are by far and away some of the most convoluted and difficult to understand things I have ever worked with and I have worked in engineering. Its therefore easy to understand why it draws so many complaints. \r\n\r\nThis job relies on no less than TWENTY SIX different applications and web based programmes for an agent to do their job. These range from programmes which look and operate like they were conceived in the late 80s to fairly straightforward and easy to understand modern applications. The issue here is that the sheer abundance of different applications which don't work together leads to complications and very often 'Control Errors' for example inputting a refund amount into the archaic 'TS2' requires the same amount to be typed into the 'CLARA' app. If these amounts don't match it is picked up by the system itself, which begs the question, that if the system can pick up the error, why can it not ask the agent to rectify it before it's an issue which leads to penalisation. This makes it seem like a great deal is stacked against you and that the entire system is a mackled together mess of programs the company has adopted at various stages instead of working on a central system or application which ensures accuracy and simplicity for agents to use. \r\n\r\nThe job relies heavily on 'Help Files' this is essentially the web based handbook which is used by all customer facing agents. It is a messy and badly organized grouping of flowcharts and forms which are difficult to navigate and in some cases even contradict each other. This makes using them and trusting them very difficult, as once you feel like you know certain answers you may start to avoid using the Help Files, however this will come to bite you as not all cases follow the same process. The saving grace here is the access to floorwalkers who can guide you through the help files or deliver answers from their own expertise. However I have seen agents receive \u2018Standards not met\u2019 responses to their resolutions which have been based on advice from the floorwalkers. So whilst they are as thorough as they can be, it's no guarantee of success or protection from penalisation. \r\n\r\nBreaks and lunches are set out each day and can very from day to day / week to week, however you will rarely be able to adhere to these as the nature of the job means you'll be on the phone for most of the day and breaks will depend on when you can get off the phone and finish the admin side of the call. This is tolerable as breaks will come along at some point. What is difficult to accept is the lack of a sensible cut off time at the end of the day. If you finish at 6:30 and a call comes through at 6:25 you are expected to give at least 15 mins unpaid overtime. Whilst on probation you are not eligible for ANY overtime pay and the only compensation you will get for this overtime is breaktime back, managers will be tremendously cryptic and ambiguous about how and when this time can be taken. Essentially what this means is that there is an expectation for you to be amenable to work at least 5 hours a month for free and any further overtime will be paid back in kind over the course of following working days. \r\n\r\nYou are expected to go into the office no more than once a fortnight. This makes office days seem like little more than an inconvenience as they follow the very same format as any other day spent at home. Floorwalkers are still accessed through zoom and conversations with co-workers are minimal given the nature of the job.

Interpret this with a grain of salt knowing it is partially anecdotal.\r\n\r\nWork Life Balance: Good for the most part. On call rotations and failover exercises are a pain. How much your on call rotation will suck depends on how well/poorly your product is engineered. I know a lot of people that took 4 weeks PTO. Nobody logs it and recruiters openly advertise this fact. PTO is technically accrued but it's treated more like an \"unlimited PTO\" system. Seems like a slippery slope and always made me uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nTechnology: Entire company is fully in AWS, which is fine. Tech stack will vary by team, I worked mostly with Java/Spring Boot/PostgreSQL/Kinesis. Some lambdas here and there.\r\n\r\nCoworkers: Very hit or miss. Associates tend to be good but my product in particular was crippled by staggering numbers of contractors. The contractors were noticeably worse in quality than associates - they had a lower standard of work and were more difficult to communicate with. They often held critical knowledge of systems and would then leave. Management consistently said they wanted to replace contractors with associates but struggle to hire - probably empty promises.\r\n\r\nRemote Work: This perk, as I'm told by former coworkers, is going away. The \"hybrid work\" three days a week will probably be team norms. Good luck retaining talent C1. I was never in office and this is one reason I left.", "cons": "Forced Downtime: There were weeks I struggled to find 20-30 hours of work to do. Leadership from the Director+ level either had no vision for the product or failed to communicate it. Product always seemed lost. We never had a refined backlog. Enterprise teams were major blockers. Developers spend a lot of time just spinning their wheels. Forced downtime is nice occasionally but I was bored out of my mind far too often - I probably could have worked a second job.\r\n\r\nEnterprise Teams: Enterprise teams are absolutely atrocious. They were the number one blocker to getting anything done. Our CI/CD pipelines were continuously going down. You'd get nonsense errors and build failures for no reason at all. Builds took 30 minutes+ and would fail because some behind the scenes enterprise service was overburdened. It would often take days if not weeks to get a response from enterprise teams to fix critical issues with deployment.\r\n\r\nDevelopment Process: Again, just like with enterprise teams this one was a headache. Architecture teams are required to sign off on major design decisions and API contracts and would take weeks to respond. On one instance an architect mandated a design pattern that wasn't supported by our enterprise tools and it caused weeks of issues. CI/CD was a constant pain. Getting new applications onboarded was a headache, enterprise portals rarely worked.\r\n\r\nSalary: If you're a talented engineer, you can do much much better. Leadership attempted to counter as I was on my way out the door until they heard my new offer. C1 has taken insufficient measures to stop the bleeding in the form of tech attrition. The CEO, Rich Fairbank, went on record saying Software Engineers were too expensive. Sorry Rich, I'll go somewhere that pays me what I'm worth - enjoy your contractors.\r\n\r\nStacked Ranking: Stacked ranking is horrible. Managers went up to meetings to defend your rating and to get anything above Strong (Average) you basically had to have a ton of extracurriculars. Doing your job and doing it very well isn't good enough at Capital One. They expect you to be earning certifications, volunteering, conducting interviews, joining resource groups, etc. to \"differentiate yourself\" from your peers. It's all crap and probably a cost saving measure so they don't have to give too many people decent raises every year.\r\n\r\nHybrid Work: People want fully remote work. There are antiquated managers who feel like things are \"just better\" in person but many many engineers want fully remote work or have left to get it. Nobody wants to go from the comfort of their home to having a commute, spending money on gas & vehicle, prep time before and after work, just to sit in a noisy open office environment where things are less productive.\r\n\r\nProducts: A lot of C1 products I dealt with weren't engineered to a very high standard. Our pages are slow to load, don't look great, and are dwarfed by more established competition. I didn't feel proud to work on a product that felt was vastly inferior to the competition. Constant reorgs and lack of vision from leadership was a consistent hurdle."}, {"review_title": "Data Science", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "14 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Vice President", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for", "cons": "Focus on communication a lot"}, {"review_title": ".", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "14 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great company to work with", "cons": "none so far that I can say"}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in Raleigh, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management & growth opportunities are good here", "cons": "Salary and limited bonuses and benefits"}, {"review_title": "Management is horrible", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Front Desk Receptionist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Okay pay, okay pay, that\u2019s it", "cons": "No breaks, very poor management, one very rude and unprofessional manager"}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Funding Analyst in Plano, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company helpful managers and staff", "cons": "No cons just wish there was more over time."}], [{"review_title": "Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Senior Data Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance, workload, compensation", "cons": "It definitely depends on the teams"}, {"review_title": "They've taken care of me better than any other company.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Business Engagement Lead in Plano, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexibility, understanding managers, little to no micromanagement", "cons": "Certain LOBs can get \"favoritism\" and tend to drive decisions regardless of logic or situation."}, {"review_title": "Product executes.
