First you have to be white, then in their in group, then be their favourite and then if you can present yourself well and if all the stars align there is scope for you to move up in this company. If you are person of minority or a hard worker you are doomed.\r\n\r\nRe-orgs and promotions are rigged\r\nEvery re-Org in this company is a chance for people at the top to give positions of power to their faithful.

The last this this company did which was of any use was building a guranteed product for sub-prime customers and now they milk it for decades. All the folks at the top do is the same 5-6 campaigns and high five each other. The US parent however is actually very very good but Canada leadership has massively lost its way. The only time I felt motivated was listening to Rich Fairbanks and then a month later I realized how different the ground reality in Canada is to his vision.\r\n\r\nNo tech innovation \r\nWhile the US parent has done a ton of innovation in product and tech in Canada it is a mockery of Tech innovation. The company claims to operate like a nimble tech company which happens to be a bank but they are exactly the opposite. Nothing is done in name of innovation and lip service keeps you in the job.\r\nNothing you do here adds to the resume other than the company name.\r\n\r\nLeadership is self obsessed\r\nThis is the weirdest thing I have seen in a company and I have been in a lot of them in my career. People who are frankly kids love to talk about themselves that try to be comically vulnerable and personal with employees and because it is far from genuine people literally laugh at them in the background.

I find the medical insurance (bronze/silver/gold options through Aetna) to be expensive compared to the HMO I can get through my spouse's employer, but I don't think the Aetna costs at Capital One are out of line with what I have observed at other companies; I'm not a fan of the high deductible though. Capital One does try to brunt the pain of the high deductible by offering free health clinics on site at major locations (no copay - family members can also visit) and no copay to visit CVS minute clinics. Very progressive company - just announced expansion of maternity leave to 12 weeks PAID, 2 weeks paid paternity leave, 6 weeks paid adoption leave/surrogate leave (if your child born via surrogate), $10K contribution toward adoption expenses, fabulous medical benefits for families with autistic children. Company will contribute up to $1000 toward your flexible spending accounts (medical/dependent care). \r\n\r\nMy manager (and senior leadership team in general) have been absolutely fabulous - when my dad died, I was told \"take the time you need\" - very humane.\r\n\r\nI had severe culture shock after joining Capital One for a very long time... I have encountered very few \"slackers\" and am continually impressed at how responsive most associates are to any requests/questions I may have - it's highly unusual for it to take more than 4 hours to get a response. Capital One takes pains to hire very intelligent, data-driven associates. I am very satisfied with my work/life balance, but that balance can be a bit unpredictable at times (mainly because I am in an operational role - stuff happens... and you have to deal with it right then).\r\n\r\nCapital One has taken great pains to recruit/retain associates hired as interns/new college grads - this program is very well-designed/run. They would be well-advised to pay a reasonably equivalent level of attention to experienced hires (obviously, more seasoned hires don't need as quite as much hand holding).  While there is clearly room for improvement in this area, I've observed some progress on this front over the past few months - a *lot* of energy spent on trying to improve the onboarding process for experienced hires within my line of business so that they have everything  they need to do their jobs once they finish the 1.5 day long HR onboarding process (which incidentally is *very* well done).  Similarly, I've observed some efforts aimed at reducing the red tape that makes it difficult to do your job efficiently and reduce the \"environmental\" learning curve associated with being a new hire. While you might be a subject matter expert in your area, you can't be effective without also understanding the company environment.\r\n\r\nI am thoroughly impressed by the company's commitment to doing the right thing by their customers. While I won't go into any detail here, suffice it to say Capital One gives up a LOT of $ by not following the same practices used by many of the other large financial companies. The latitude given to call center associates to satisfy a customer's needs is unprecedented.  \r\n\r\nCapital One University is a fabulous resource for associates ... many different types of training courses (online, instructor lead) are available - many at no cost to the associate's department. Subjects covered are typically either line of business centric or role centric (e.g. project management college, software engineering college, information security college, etc.). \r\n\r\nThe corporate culture is heavily oriented toward recognizing associate contributions. The size of your pay raise and bonus are heavily predicated by your performance review rating  (which is in turn based upon your contributions); the higher your performance review rating, the larger your pay raise/bonus.  Bonuses can comprise a very significant portion of associate compensation - the higher your paygrade, the more significant the bonus is.  \r\n\r\nAny associate can recognize another associate or team of associates for their contributions. The recognization can range from a simple thank you note to points that can be redeemed by the associate for gift cards from a wide variety of vendors to cash awards. \r\n\r\nPromotions are a *HUGE* deal at Capital One.. they are generally recognized twice a year. All promotions are publicly announced (typically first within the individual line of business, then company wide). If you are on the receiving end of a promotion, you can count on being flooded with congratulatory IMs, emails, and phone calls from fellow associates once the announcement is public. It can be a bit overwhelming if you aren't expecting it.  Promotion recipients are also invited to a luncheon with their managers and members of the senior leadership team.  I personally have felt very empowered to \"grow my flame\" here.\r\n\r\nMobility within the organization is excellent - there are many, many  roles available within information technology. If you get tired of your current role, there's an excellent chance there will be an opening in a different area of IT that you can apply for.", "cons": "The \"startup\" culture at Capital One can be a double edge sword - if something isn't working, just wait six months (or less) and it will change. \r\n\r\nIf you are a person with a \"glass half empty\" attitude or someone who greatly values organizational structures/processes etc. remaining static over a long period of time, this is NOT the company for you. \r\n\r\nThere have been big changes in the senior leadership team (most external hires) in my line of business during the time I have been at Capital One, a significant number (1100+) of associates hired (many as part of the drive to insource key functions). While I think the CEO and very senior management have good plans for the company (e.g., identifying key objectives each year, and making solid plans to reach them), objective identification/planning within my own line of business has historically been shaky at best, largely due to understaffing/lack of resources and multiple reorgs. I have noticed some positive movement in this area  over the past 2-3 months - I do like what I'm seeing/hearing - but will reserve judgement for another few months.  If this changes significantly for the better, I'll up my rating from 4 to 5 stars.\r\n\r\nPredictably, mentoring of associates is not what it should be in my line of business given the staffing challenges.The company does pair up a \"buddy\" with new hires who request it. While I had a buddy, I didn't find it useful because the buddy was not in the same location or same role as me, and so was not able to answer many of the questions that I had.IT has been switching over to agile-based methods (not just for software development), while also shifting to a federated model in which IT resources are assigned to a particular line of business rather than a centralized pool of IT resources. While there are some distinct advantages to that approach (e.g., IT resources are intimately familiar with the applications of their line of business and the associated network infrastructure; fewer issues with prioritizing needs across different lines of business), it makes it difficult for the remaining \"central\" IT organization to keep track of everything that is going on. Time will tell how this gamble pays off.\r\n\r\nAssociates in general don't like the performance management system, but overall I think it provides a decent measure of fairness. Everyone that I've known that has received a promotion truly deserved it.. 360 feedback is strongly emphasized as part of the performance management process. Forced \"cross-calibration\" sessions amongst managers of all associates at the same level are performed biannually as part of the performance management process to ensure everyone uses the same standards to rate associates. This can be a little awkward if you are at the same level as your manager (yes it happens). Your manager's ability/willingness to advocate for you during these sessions is key. If the managers participating in these cross calibration sessions don't think highly of you, you're sunk...You need to be *very* aware of that in your daily interactions with other associates. One of the main criticisms of the performance management system is that it emphasizes individual performace more than team performance.

Full-time Engineers were given a huge pay bump this year to compete with other large tech companies (time will tell if this was only due to inflation). 401k match is the best I have seen anywhere (up to 6%). Health plan is just OK.\r\n- Company appears to be doing pretty well. However, there is a dark side to this that I will get to.\r\n- Lots of free and easily accessible learning resources. They will pay for all sorts of things, from certification exams to degree programs. There are also tons of opportunities to present about various topics to large swaths of the organization.\r\n- Internal mobility is highly encouraged. Employees routinely jump from team to team and division to division. Internal job board allows you to easily find and apply for roles around the company.\r\n- Engineers are given a lot of say within the company. As much as I will complain about the tech org later, CapOne does seem to be genuinely trying to encourage a strong engineering culture and giving them the power they need to succeed.\r\n- Heavy focus on their TDP program, which aims to attract graduates straight out of college and give them lots of training inside of the company. Sounds like the TDP experience can vary widely depending on what kind of teams you get placed on.", "cons": "- CapOne wants be a tech company soooo bad, but it doesn't seem to understand what that means or how to do that. They hired a bazillion software engineers, designers, project, and product people, but have no idea what to do with them. Lots of engineers spend all day just updating libraries and re-hydrating VM images. Internal product teams get more love and resources than the public-facing products that actually make the company money. But hey, this message seems to be making investors excited.\r\n- Some divisions have strong products, talent, and culture (*cough* Card). Some divisions are really floundering from both a talent and business perspective. This creates a self-reinforcing loop where good people constantly flee to the already-capable teams and everyone else gets left with the lesser performers. Credit cards are still hands-down their cash cow, so everything else plays second fiddle.\r\n- Lots of power jockeying between teams and senior leaders. Typically this comes in the form of creating processes that make a team a gate-keeper for the rest of the company, such as requiring everyone to get their approval for something as simple as adding a column to a database. More and more decision-making authority is being given to HQ teams like Cyber and Change Management, while the engineering teams on the front lines building the actual products have little to no say in how they are allowed to develop things. Little trust is extended to engineers throughout the company; instead, HQ teams try to micro-manage product teams and force them into supposed best practices despite not knowing anything about their products or code bases. This is made all the worse by people with little to no engineering background repeatedly being put in senior engineering leadership roles. These internal tools and processes that lock everything down are more often than not half-baked and have all sorts of functional issues. There is a lot of bureaucracy even compared to other financial services companies that I have worked at.\r\n- Their well-known cyber security incident in 2019 was CapOne's 9/11 moment. At first there was a real drive to fix systemic issues that led to the incident, but as time goes on this initiative has driven the tech organization to the brink of madness and self-destruction. Crazy amounts of engineers are being used to do lots of BS work in the name of \"cyber security\" and \"compliance\" at the expense of improving their products, but very little of it actually helps their security posture. This is driving away tons of talented tech folks who don't want to spend their entire days working on nonsense like filling out paperwork rather than building products.\r\n- Their Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging program is borderline toxic. Race and gender is brought up constantly and seems to be the only thing that matters to most people. If you fall into one of the in-vogue demographics (and don't work at a branch), you will be given several speaking and leadership opportunities. If you aren't, prepare to be berated either implicitly or explicitly on a daily basis. Some company policies and mandatory trainings are created and run exclusively by the EmpowHER and Black Leadership Council groups. Whenever I wanted to hire someone of certain ethnicities on my team, HR always demanded a written explanation due to \"diversity concerns\", but never did the same for other ethnicities. The sad part is Asians (east and central) get crapped on the most despite making up half of the company's software engineers; lots of H1Bs that are bullied into long hours and low pay increases under threat of losing their visas. The company should do its best to respect people regardless of things they can't control like sex, but this DIB program isn't the way to deal with that topic.\r\n\r\nSome things I saw related to their DIB efforts: a woman muting all of the men at the start of a conference call because they \"already got to speak enough,\" to lots of cheering. A Division President highlighting the \"white\" data point on an employee demographics chart during an all-hands meeting and saying \"This is the problem right here with our diversity efforts...\" despite the numbers showing that Caucasians were under-represented relative to national demographics. A recruiter got drunk at a company event and spilled that a lot of them dig through candidates' public profiles to see if they might be Republican supporters and reject anyone that they suspect of this. A very active member of the DIB program on my team repeatedly complaining in private about \"all of the Indians\" that worked at CapOne."}], [{"review_title": "Great Company, Demanding as Heck", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Senior Content Strategist in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Diverse, invested in employee wellness, hip, fair pay, nice recognition and incentives", "cons": "Performance management is the pits.

Your pay rise is based on you being ranked against your peers even if you do a totally different role. This encourages a toxic and political environment which encourages the wrong behaviours and a blame culture as people climb over each other to improve their rating . It does not encourage collaboration. Good old fashioned hard work and being good at the job you are employed to do is not rewarded, your performance rating is based on the things that you do over and above your core role. If you are not given the opportunities by your manager to get involved in other things in the first place, you will never do well on the performance curve.

These goals will be purposefully set at unrealistic levels so that when you inevitably fail to meet them, they can use it as a reason to withhold bonuses, offer a less attractive raise, or put you on the chopping block depending on your personal relationship with your manager.\r\nEvery month you WILL be told that you're spending too much time talking to your customers, and you will be asked to reduce your AHT (Average handle time) or you risk termination, even though AHT is largely out of your control.

Where is your diversity? When asked about why we don't recruit from other schools, you'll get some bs answer that boils down to \"we are biased and we like our bias so we won't change\".\r\n\r\nEmpathy: The amount of associates who have left purely because of their manager's emotional incompetence is absurd. The managers here are promoted not for their ability to manage people, but for their ability to deliver \"results\", which means that if your whole team is burnt out and depressed, but your manager appears to have reached some goal (emphasis on APPEAR), then they will get promoted and you'll be left with nothing but emotional trauma. \r\n\r\nWhat do they do about this? An optional 2 hour empathy training.\r\n\r\nTransparency: If you directly ask senior leadership anything that isn't a set up for an ego stroke then you will get a vague, standard PR answer that is of no substance. \"What are you doing about the absurdly high attrition?\" \"Why won't you pay us more?\" \"What is this business trying to do exactly? Other an exploit poor people\". \r\nAnswer? \"Great question! We are excited about the future of Capital One Canada! What you're asking is important to us, and we will continue to work hard on providing those answers :)\"\r\n\r\nWLB: Mixed bag, you may luck into a team that isn't doing anything, so you're free to spend the day on Reddit or applying to other jobs, or you may be absurdly busy. In any case, you will have way more meetings than you care for.\r\n\r\nOther notable issues:\r\n- They cannot retain top talent they have nothing to offer to anyone with skill and ambition. The pay isn't good, the work gets boring, the company is stagnant, the managers are bad\r\n- Senior leadership loves to talk about themselves and what hobbies they have, etc. at every meeting.... Who told them this was a good idea?\r\n- Leadership is extremely biased, but will constantly tell you how unbiased they try to be. Yet, if you don't think like them, you will not get far.\r\n- Titles are inflated. When you eventually leave, if you go to a REAL tech company, your title will decrease, but you'll be paid minimum 30%-50% more. Capital One is obsessed with titles and hierarchy, so don't get too attached to that \"senior\" next to your role.\r\n- Once you hit senior, you are not paid well if you are in a technical/analytical role.\r\n- If you're an external hire coming into a senior role, you will not get promoted unless you completely conform to their way of doing things. Again, absurdly biased\r\n- So many people who have never worked elsewhere saying how great it is comparatively....\r\n- Our business model is literally charge poor people for being poor"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Tysons Corner, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance is good", "cons": "Performance evaluation system is not great"}, {"review_title": "Great Work/Life Balance", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Always encouraging employees to take time for themselves.\r\nManager always looking out for employee areas of interest and opportunities for development.\r\nEncouraging and challenging working environment", "cons": "Has not yet allowed full-remote working"}], [{"review_title": "Great Work/Life Balance", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Always encouraging employees to take time for themselves.\r\nManager always looking out for employee areas of interest and opportunities for development.\r\nEncouraging and challenging working environment", "cons": "Has not yet allowed full-remote working"}, {"review_title": "pretty cool ngl", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Customer Solutions Specialist in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good starting pay.

I've been through 5 branch closures and when I started working for Capital One 10 years ago they had 9 Full service Capital One Branches within 10 miles radius. Now, since 2019, one full service and one Select service, now its 2021 one full service within 40 miles radius. Capital one is all about making money for Capital One they force customers to bank digital and enforce employees to bribe and make customers to bank how capital one wants them to bank. Its not all about that special connection with the customer any longer. Capital One wants banking made easier for Cap One. So they will have less ovee head and use the excuse we don't have customers coming in because they are digital this is BS! So they use the excuse to let higher paid dedicated 10-55 year employees go and then hire new hires starting them out at $15 hr. You are promised tomorrow at capital one and you are constantly being watched,threatened to be fired,written up for any and everything because of new policy/ procedure guidelines changing back and forth. Even they can't keep up with the policy changing because it literally changes daily. Good luck if you consider working here. Please take my advise! Beware of what you are getting yourself into.
