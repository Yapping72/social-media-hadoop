My interview with the Senior Director  was horrible which is the first sign that I shouldn't be joining this company. Apparently, he was given a copy of my resume which was printed out into 4 pages. He started rebutting me by saying that my resume was horrible. I am not sure who did that but everyone in the world knows that resume should be kept within 1 - 2 pages. If I have sent over my resume in 4 pages, I believe the HR will put my resume in the dumb. \r\n\r\nTo make thing worse, he showed me his resume and was telling me how great his resume was as compared to mine. He started saying that he had an interview with APPLE and they willing to increase his salary by how many %. I was so turn off by him and that I felt he was very lonely and bored in his work which he used my resume as an amusement for him during our interview. \r\n\r\nI thought I am going to be rejected but somehow I was selected. To make matter worse, I was not joining the team which the hiring manager interview me in the first place. I was being put into another team which I never met the hiring manager before. \r\n\r\nIt turns out that this manager was a newly promoted manager which never had any leadership or management experience. Things started off well until the training become like a surprise examination. You expected to know everything in theory by heart without any practical practise. \r\n\r\nWhen I seek clarification on the tasks that we doing, all we were told was to just do it like we some kind of robots. Even my manager is not able to explain why we are doing this process. It makes learning dull and feel miserable. To top off that, the manager is so competitive that he worked even if he is unwell. The only time that he took medical leave when he vomited during work. \r\n\r\nThis is also a company that uses 4 different dataware house / software to do financial budgeting. Very highly likely to have data migration issues and lots of rework is required. \r\n\r\nAPAC management loves to talk about big data analytics but never interested in investing in software. First time in my career, a CRM software is not used at all in this department. Extremely backward in technology. \r\n\r\nWorse off, the management enjoyed seeing the team work extremely late till midnight like it some form of achievement. Somehow I felt like a investment banking analyst working till late night but not getting investment banking salary. You can overhear the management saying work long work harder but when the US directors are here. They talk about scale fast and start small. Total opposite and contradicting. \r\n\r\nI was burnt out and quit at the end. It the most unhappy and stressful experience in my life which I am happy not to be part of it. When I quit, I was surprise that no exit interview is required.

There is definitely an emphasis on culture fit during hiring, and there were fewer jerks than at any place I've worked. The credo is alive in lower level employees. It is dead and rotting in senior leadership. If your role isn't working for you, you can transfer pretty easily, or otherwise find a new role internally without much hassle or drama.", "cons": "Compensation and benefits, pt. 1: Cash compensation (base + bonus) is mediocre, and equity compensation is absolutely dismal. Most employees - and everyone at the individual contributor level - are simply not eligible for long term incentives like RSUs. Virtually the only people getting long term incentives are Director level or higher. In the middle management levels, you are only eligible for equity if you have an exceptional performance review, which they force-distribute at less than 5%. Since stack ranking, forced performance distributions and concrete budgets are used, your boss almost has to be a jerk to get equity to anyone actually doing work; an excellent review must be balanced by a bad review. Compensation and benefits, pt 2: Health insurance is embarrassing for a company working in healthcare that, depending on the day and the stock price, could be the single most valuable healthcare company in the world. Employer only pays 68% of costs, and they use Aetna, which is in a constant battle with United for worst healthcare network in the country. The only saving grace is they have a Kaiser HMO option for folks in California, so you can avoid having the absolute worst provider. Compensation and benefits, pt 3: There is a pension program, but I couldn't even list it in the Pros. I did the math once, and, basically, it's like if you took a single year's raise (~4% of base salary), and invested it in a conservatively weighted / borderline poor performing 401k. You only get this benefit if you stay with the company 5 years, so at best, this benefit is like getting a bonus cost-of-living raise once you hit the 5 year mark. I think a much higher impact on potential job candidates would be to offer 4% higher base salaries and just scrap this program. Compensation and benefits, pt 4: Parental leave is generous, and the fringe benefits are competitive -- think tuition/home exercise reimbursements, the little 'thank you' awards you can use to buy gift cards or a toaster -- stuff like that. The internal education platform is also actually useful and worthwhile to use in your free time. Compensation and benefits, pt 5: The 3 year vest on 401k company matches is ostensibly in place to incentivize people to stay, but you don't have a policy that vests the people who were laid off before 3 years, even if they were caught up in broad, sweeping, non-performance-related layoffs. You're basically stealing benefit money from your employees when you do this, and it's shameful. Compensation and benefits, pt 6 (final): As a result of this overall approach to compensation & benefits, you often find people working here who are either phoning it in, playing it ultra safe, or are a little...behind in their careers. I'd like to point out how I haven't just said \"management bad\" here. It's everyone, the level 20s, the level 30s, and everyone in leadership. I'm sorry to everyone reading this currently at J&J, but, come on: you know it's true. The only reason I took this job is because I wanted something stable as I have kids. The Credo: Unfortunately, J&J can't just be a company, they have to be one of the 'good ones,' and they have this credo which you can google in 2 seconds that explains how they're going to try and be good. It's like a more longwinded 'don't be evil.' In the past, this meant that J&J thought a bit more long term, valued employee retention, and hesitated to do layoffs.

This company is trying to create a complex system that has a multiple hardware components interacting within the constraints of safety. I wouldn't trust them to create a mobile phone app that would open without crashing. Basic software knowledge is non-existent, at all levels. Most developers are academic types who spent a weekend reading a C++ blog or doing some cert and thus think they're genius programmers. Very arrogant, stubborn and egotistical. Most code reads as though the writer discovered a new C++ technique and decided to experiment with it in places it doesn't belong. The codebase is really the most nightmarish I've ever seen. Managers are of course even less knowledgeable. JnJ has a system where anyone who asks can go into management training to become a manager. There is no real merit-based promotion of people into managers, it's just based on whoever asks. In practice this means that the least competent people all become management because the more competent ones are just focusing on leaving the company. Why would a competent person want to manage completely incompetent people in a failing project? They don't even try, so they just leave. I could write an entire book on the problems and crazy absurd things that happened to me while I worked at this company, but it all comes down to general incompetence. Nobody understands software, yet that is what they are tasked to create. The product release is always pushed back, and each time more dramatically. At first it was \"just next year!\" Then when that was missed it was \"ok, just one more year!\" Then, \"two more years.\" Finally, \"three more years!\" The ultimate delivery date is receding, not approaching. I find it really hard to believe it will ever be reached. You have a product that is supposed to be used for surgery. It is safety critical and must be very robust. Meanwhile engineers can't even do their on-hardware testing because it crashes literally constantly. At one point the management sent a congratulatory email to the company for getting 75% uptime. Seriously. Would you feel comfortable going into surgery hearing that? That 75% was itself highly inflated using \"cheating\" techniques like keeping the system running even when not in use. The company feels like it is always scrambling to just get over the hill. Everyone is in denial. The problems are far more fundamental than \"just a few more features/bug fixes.\" There are fundamental problems with the very core of the SW in almost every module in the entire system."}, {"review_title": "Overall organization", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strong focus on diversity Focus on career development Roles allow for great flexibility in personal growth Focus on credo and culture Opportunity for advancement", "cons": "Frequent reorganization in past few years Slow decision making High ambiguity, so need high degree of self direction and creativity"}, {"review_title": "Analyst", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Place to work at", "cons": "Might be a bit demanding sometimes"}, {"review_title": "Good Culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Finance Analyst in Bogota, Cundinamarca", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good carrer path opportunities .", "cons": "A lot of movement within areas"}, {"review_title": "Experience", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Distrubutor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good, welcoming environment with positive and lively people", "cons": "It may at times be stressful"}], [{"review_title": "Amazing Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Account Manager in Cleveland, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture, great pay, great leaders", "cons": "None that I can think of at this time"}, {"review_title": "Excellent", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Full Stack Developer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good team work and understanding", "cons": "No - - - - -"}, {"review_title": "Nice", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Customer Service", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Tuition assistance provided by the company", "cons": "Didn't have bad experience at all"}, {"review_title": "yes", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Consultant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "very very good consultant team", "cons": "not a lot of collaboration"}, {"review_title": "Great Long-term company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-emphasis on development -ability to move around to different finance functions easily", "cons": "-less of a meritocracy -minimum time in role needed to advance"}, {"review_title": "No room for growth", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Associate in Fort Washington, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay is alright and they paid weekly", "cons": "Very bias and there is no room for growth.

Ring-fencing employees to Consumer means people are choosing to leave the organisation rather than be forced into Kenvue (awful name). We're no longer allowed to move into MedTech or Pharm within J&J which was a big pull factor in the past. Such a large company it's easy to be lost at what you're doing. People tend to work in certain functions and rotate every 18-24 months. It makes the job a lot more complicated than it should be as you can't get someone with the knowledge. Whilst there's a large finance presence in the UK, I've found all the roles I've done to be the most mentally unstimulating roles. Sometimes feel as if you're IT support as a lot of processes are standardised, automated or outsourced and you're there to solve the problems when they arise. Quite a lot of downtime outside busy periods but heavy workloads when it's busy. Whilst the job is easy, it's nice to feel energetic about your role which I don't think I ever have at J&J. Salaries used to be good but annual increases aren't much more than 1-3% even if you fully meet/exceed your objectives. This is despite rises being described as merit increases. The company did nothing for Cost of Living until October where we got 2% for some employees which didn't touch the sides. Salaries are generally below market level. People I know who've left have got 20-40% increases which are hugely in excess of general inflation. UK Finance employees from PG 25+ used to get a car allowance (minimum \u00a36.5k dependant on grade) when you qualify which has now been removed for newly qualified or new joiners who are already qualified. Makes the package unbelievably low for the market. To get a Car Allowance you have to be a Manager (PG 30+). If you're an Analyst or Senior Analyst, you won't get it when joining - one to be aware of in case it's ever mentioned in interviews as they may not be aware as it doesn't affect them. This is making attracting talent as well as retaining non-qualified employees impossible. J&J Flex is too restrictive and a 3 day office week is unnecessary, but the company is tone deaf to the external reality. People are leaving over this. IT equipment really isn't as good as it should be. Laptops are really basic, slow and small. Very difficult to work on unless connected to wired internet and docked to a monitor."}, {"review_title": "Was the best of times\u2026 worst of times.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "10 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Sr. Director in Raritan, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people, benefits and brands.
