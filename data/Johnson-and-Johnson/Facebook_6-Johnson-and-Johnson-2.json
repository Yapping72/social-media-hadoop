will get and type of users you will have to handle also don't worth the money offered,\nthe benefits of 4000kc are extracted directly from your netto before been converted into benefit on a card...so its a big scam!\nThe internal co-workers that need your support are way worst than any others non educated end users:\nimpolite,rude,impatient,insisting heavily,stubborn,giving you no consideration or thanks most of the time,acting like they are the only one in the world,not listening or reading properly,acting like half Gods or spoil capricious child, arrogeante,ignorante,intellectually lazy,dishonest,lying,almost disable,too assisted,missing common sense,missing social intelligeance and basic knowledge of their internal tools,unfair,ungratefull,totally under dependancy of others people to do what they don't want or don't know, when actually most of the time they should as these things they are asking, are in their work scope,they will be complaining,negociating,acting angry,treating to report you to your manager and doing, if the proposed resolutions don't fit their expectations meaning to say when it involve any single or simple action, efforts from their side.\nBasically they come to you with their issue and expect immediate easy solving while barely providing clear explanation or historic of it,your investigation question will annoy them,they will hang up or disconnect if you ask to much question, so you will have to guess and deal with it as it is while they show no interest or involvement on their side to help solve their own problem,this support is like a laundry place where they drop their dirty basket or clothes and expect you to clean it for them most are unable to provide decent communication clean of mistakes and mispelling on mail and chat in any language,on the chat they will treat you like a half bot half slave under staff...the worst is that people you deal with are suppose to be capable and clever from their level of diploma and their major position in the company but you will quicky find out that these overpaid Pharma people of the West are just hijacking their salary and totally rely on people like you to perform every single part of the job they are not able to do and generously paid for, while you are the one who get low money,no real benefits or advantages unlike these people,above all that management pressure for the targets which is actually only what seems to matter to them, all the credo ethic speech on the induction day don't seem to apply for the half slave bot located in Prague,after a month and half your team leader will expect you to be operative in terms of knowledges like its been a 6 months you are on the job, while the users you are forced to support are in the company for some 3 years minimum and actually don't seem to know as much as you do..try to share your concern with management about the cold fact that their users really need training on how to behave and interact properly with a non artificial intelligeance and the management will pretend to listen while giving you pattern corpo templates as only answer...make you feel like you are the trouble and everything is fine as it is like it is in the company,salary not negociable so basically it is what it is accept it or go off fast...as the management don't even have the guts or people skills to fire you...J&J don't want to educate internal users neither paying you more for having to support been treated like a cheap under staff by the one you have to help.This kind of position have no value or
