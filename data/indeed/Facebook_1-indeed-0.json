There are no lack of interesting, impactful problems to solve!\r\n\r\nCompensation for engineering in Indeed is one of the best in the Singapore tech landscape. This is supplemented by excellent healthcare and other \"standard\" tech benefits like daily catered meals, well stocked pantry and flexible working hours. To prevent people from burning out, Indeed instituted monthly \"You days\" which are Indeed wide holidays for all employees. On top of that, all employees have unlimited paid-time-off and managers would actively encourage their teammates to utilize this benefit. It is very clear that leadership all the way from the top cares about a healthy work-life balance here in Indeed.\r\n\r\nIndeed also embraces working remotely.

Sorry, you\u2019re not \u201caligned\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t even try pushing back as micro-management (ex: getting your simple A/B experiments approved before testing) is the expected cultural norm here.\n\n- Culture in Singapore reminds you a lot of working in a large bank: Lots of politics, people sweet-talking on the face while they complain behind your back, lots of talk around process yet very little work actually gets done, leaders who do a lot of theoretical pseudo-intellectual debates but with little practical implementation knowledge nor experience.\n\n- Hiring processes are broken: The quality of the people varies a lot. You might find an occasional outlier rockstar but huge variations in quality of folks. From a Singapore standpoint, the overall avg engineering quality is definitely below market, and part of it can also be attributed to the quality of product-mandates held by Singapore teams \u2014 since the work is not very challenging, you don\u2019t tend to attract the best engineers anyways!

With everyone due to go back on the same days, childcare services are overloaded and if you are lucky enough to get childcare the prices are exorbitant to the point where it would be cheaper for one parent to stop working. So, Indeed, my question to you is as a company that prides itself on being an industry leader and advocating for diversity & inclusion, why are you creating a situation that will force your female employees to resign? Obviously, there will be fathers impacted by this also, but it is well known that women usually give up their careers to be primary childminders and carers. I must say that I am disappointed by Indeed's lack of foresight in the matter and have no doubt that Indeed will lose top talent because of this decision.

Some folks in leadership roles consistently played favorites and created roles for unqualified team members to get promoted into. When looking to join a different department, the internal job interview process was clunky and cumbersome. Any internal job seeker could get through 5 rounds of interviews only for that department to decide to cancel the role last minute. How does this happen at a company who vows to advocate for job seekers? An employee referral system is in place but if your referral is nearing 40 years in age, has ample job experience, and they\u2019re not applying for a seasoned engineering role, then forget about it. Indeed knows inexperience is cheaper. (They like compensating at the lower end of the salary range.) This place is a stepping stone, but do not let the branding blind you. There is no mystique to working at Indeed. It is just as big and dysfunctional a corporation as any. I can guarantee that competence is not a requirement.

I was hired to do projects and serve as a dedicated representative for specific clients, but instead I ended up working general tech support out of a ticket queue and doing very little for projects. I also did very little actual technical work even though the interviews focused heavily on scripting and my understanding of APIs; most of my responsibilities involved reiterating our documentation back at partners who hadn't read it.\r\n - I had no support from management. They did not notice or care that I literally never submitted my quarterly goals, nor did they offer advice for what those goals should be or track my progress toward those (nonexistent) goals. They did not provide feedback toward how I was tracking toward my role's KPIs and expectations either, which meant I was always blindsided by negative items in my performance reviews.\r\n - I did not receive a compensation increase during my time at the company. When I asked my management when my compensation evaluation would be, they would not give a specific answer. This is unacceptable considering the US has been experiencing an extreme amount of inflation for the last couple years.\r\n - A single mistake was often communicated to me by multiple people, amplifying how bad it felt. I also never received positive feedback for my accomplishments.\r\n - I did not have any agency and frequently had to consult with external parties to perform tasks or find answers to things that should have been within the scope of my job or should happen automatically as part of business processes (e.g. new employee access requests, documentation updates, etc.).\r\n - The company was SO disorganized. Every team had its own ways of doing things and used its own tools, which led to confusion and duplicate work. There were no standardized processes. My team had practically no documentation and I had to learn almost everything about the tools I was supposed to support by pestering my senior coworkers while actively working cases, often providing customers the wrong answers in the process. We should have had internal knowledge base articles for the vast majority of questions they were asking, like every other tech support job I've worked in the past has done.\r\n - Work/life balance was very poor. I frequently felt pressured to work after hours or even on weekends in order to respond to emails or complete tasks (even while my managers gave lip service to the notion that I shouldn't). Even though my work day officially started at 9am, people (including my management) would frequently schedule meetings before that, and I was expected to accept them because of \"time zone differences.\" The result was an 8am meeting almost every day of every week.\r\n - Although a minor gripe compared to the above, Indeed has a very strong webcam culture. You're implicitly expected to be on camera during videoconference meetings, which removes one of the main benefits of remote work: sometimes I want to do my job in pajamas with bed hair."}, {"review_title": "Good work environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Regional Sales Manager in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strong team morale and good benefits.", "cons": "sometimes long hours and heavy workload."}, {"review_title": "Great community, excellent work /life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Senior Customer Success Manager in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great community, excellent work /life balance", "cons": "CS in general is very under estimated and undervalued."}, {"review_title": "Nice company with great potential", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Analyst", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent employee benefits, work-life balance, great opportunities, freedom to pursue desired career path.", "cons": "Lots of non-technical folks now sitting in mid and senior managerial positions ruining to ground all the hard work done by people in the first 15 years."}, {"review_title": "Poor Management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Recruiter", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits.

Even if you grow your revenue more, they will make more money and be more likely to be promoted because Indeed values quota attainment percentages over revenue growth."}], [{"review_title": "Working at Indeed", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Senior Sales Ops Analyst in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary and benefits are really good", "cons": "Leadership structure and direction can be challenging"}, {"review_title": "Great learning experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "30 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Content Blog Writer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Consistent salary increment Manageable deadlines Competent editorial team", "cons": "Add more payment methods for remote writers"}, {"review_title": "Good enough", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Compliance Analyst in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Collaborative work environment with smart people", "cons": "Lack of direction by management"}, {"review_title": "Great perks", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "3 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Account Executive in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "No cons - great comp and culture", "cons": "no cons all pros - recommend"}, {"review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Account Executive in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture Great perks Great management", "cons": "No big cons that I would note"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Marketing in Birmingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good support for developing more", "cons": "Didn\u2019t really have A bad experience"}, {"review_title": "positive", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Sales Executive in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "salary and bonus's are good", "cons": "the criteria to progress is time orientated"}, {"review_title": "Innovative", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Senior Account Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The culture The people The benefits BRG's Innovative Great place to learn and start Growth or lateral career opportunities", "cons": "SLT is disconnected from realistic economy Quotas are untainable and no transparency how its created So many internal glitches / outages LOW PAY, minimal raises 40/60 OTE - LOWWWW BASE micromangement"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Account Executive", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pto, comp, you days are all good", "cons": "Hybrid work are something I\u2019d make full time remote"}, {"review_title": "Slave Labor", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Resume Writer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You set your own schedule and decide how much you work.", "cons": "They force you to accept a flat pay rate even as an employee on payroll.

During my time there, they 10x'd both headcount (from 1100 to 11k) and revenue (400M to 4B). And with that growth came a lot of pain - unreasonable expectations, fast promotions for people that weren't ready, and empire building like crazy. I had the misfortune to end up working for not one, but three terribly incompetent middle-managers. All seemed to have \"good intentions\" and promised to \"value coaching\", but had zero interest in trying to understand what I was working on, give me guidance, or actually invest in my career. After four years, I was managing a team of four and running six engineering teams but still had an entry-level IC title and mediocre salary, and was just told I needed to \"do more\" by my idiot of a boss who got promoted to director in less than three years and who described the sum of his responsibilities as \"providing updates to management\" to one of my frustrated directs.\n\nEverywhere I looked around the company, I saw the living embodiment of the \"peter principle\" - managers who rose to the level of their incompetence. The product org doubled down on micro A/B tests; I was recently told by a good friend who still works there that the most innovative thing to come out of Indeed in the past 5 years was to switch from \"pay per click\" to \"pay per apply\". I learned too late, as a platform PM focused on building internal tools, that the only sure route to promotion was to run a few dozen A/B tests that moved conversion rates from 3.79% to 3.84%. At the end of my time at Indeed, I was working 80 hours a week and all my manager could suggest in areas of improvement when I asked what it would take to get promoted to Senior Product Manager was \"do more\". A few months later I was a Senior Product Manager at Amazon, and now I'm a Director of Product. \n\nIn recent years, leadership has brought in a bunch of jargon-spouting MBA consultant types for high-paying senior director and VP roles, basically ruining any chance for real impact among hard-working PMs who want to move up. It seems much of this stems from putting a former sales leader in charge of their enterprise product development, and due to the leader of the SMB unit's personal biases (he has an ivy-league MBA, so therefore...). \n\nIf you're looking for a steady paycheck and some free food, and don't mind dealing with a ton of misguided requests raining down on you demanding results, look no further.

You are treated like a child and constantly micromanaged and babysat from the top down. The company grew too big too fast and sales people are not valued - you are just a number.

If you are with the company for many years (as many reps are because they get comfortable) you stop learning completely and the job becomes robotic. They don't care about how much revenue you're bringing in just about how many calls you can make and 'impact' conversations you can have with the same clients. The constant micromanaging is so exhausting and makes you feel incompetent as an adult and salesperson. Management claims to take feedback from reps but they don't have any idea what is actually going on in the day to day. All they care about it hitting their astronomical goals year over year instead of understanding what our clients really want. Reps are forced to shove products in our client's faces that make NO SENSE for their business or needs which ruins relationships really quickly.

They want to push out the talent so they can bring in recent grads for 1/4 of the pay.\r\n\r\nIf you try to bring up any of these challenges to your direct manager or leadership they shut it down immediately and tell you you're being negative. I have seen MANY people let go or forced to leave over the years because they voiced their concerns.\r\n\r\nYou are also only promoted to team lead or director if you interview 5+ times (even after being there 5,6,7 years) to prove you are 'resilient' even th"}, {"review_title": "Could use improvements", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 May 2022", "job_title": "Client Success Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Direct management is great, teammates are awesome, potential for growth, overall great place to be.", "cons": "Many things need to be worked out.

I am so sick of these redundant meetings.\n* Management is completely lost -- I think a large part of this is due to more recent churn in managerial roles, but, overall, in my time here it seems management have a hard time making and sticking with decisions, which leads to chaos as teams scramble to reevaluate their priorities, for example. A recent survey showed that among the largest issues employees were dealing with is their stress level at work, which I wholly attribute to this disorganization with management and their lack of communication and solid direction. SLT I think does fine being 'hands-off' to let the business units make their decisions, but beyond that, top-down it seems like everyone is almost entirely lost, and that feeds into the IC roles. \n* It bugs me when we design things that force users into a particular flow to gather more data on them. The intent is to get more data for internal usage so we make better decisions, but the outcome is forcing people into fewer and fewer workflows, which I imagine many people don't enjoy.

For a company that claims to be a data-driven company, it actually fails to avoid problems encountered by other tech companies even if the data is available on how to avoid it. \r\n\r\nIt entered a hyper-growth stage with clearly no goals to back it up, which basically hired too many people without a lot of things to do to the point that it actually slowed down hiring during 2019 because it realized it's mistake but don't want to tell everyone about it.\r\n\r\nSenior leadership aren't really honest about things, when asked legitimate concerns, it is redirected back to the person asking the concern as another question. This is attributed to the fact that the company hired too many people and basically didn't really completely check if the person they hired was a good fit for the company. Which led to new people basically changing the company's identity and culture and led to attrition to long time employees.\r\n\r\nThe company now has a culture of re-inventing the wheel and tries to emulate good tech companies but actually just emulates the bad things those tech companies does.\r\n\r\nIndeed itself is oblivious to the norms of non-US locations. A lot of perks are given off to US offices but those same perks are never in non-US locations, so much for advertising in a company that thrives in equality.\r\n\r\nIn terms of equality too, some employees are not well compensated especially those who came from third-world countries. If you are not in a particular role, you don't really have a lot of value within the company which is evident in the compensation difference. A lot of ex-employees who moved to other companies with the same role experienced more compensation equality compared to Indeed.\r\n\r\nUnlimited PTO is a lie, basically, you get it as long as you manager approves it. The worst thing about is it that, if you file for PTO, you really won't know if your manager has approved it as part of your unlimited PTO or your regular vacation leave.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the last point, Indeed has hired a lot of people on the leadership roles that aren't really what you call \"leaders\". These so-called leader never gives value to the people that they \"lead\" and are always thinking of themselves. These so-called leaders do not know how to effectively manage or lead people. The problem is too that, if Indeed does get people who know how to actually lead, they never try to retain them or support them properly. These so-called leaders have also abused some of the powers by indirectly harassing employees to make themselves voluntarily quit in order for Indeed to not pay for anything. These so-called leaders, never are very selfish and don't understand that they succeed when their people succeed, instead they make themselves succeed and force their subordinates to do things that are not even beneficial for them."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Manager, Data Strategy & Analytics", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Takes really good care of their employees", "cons": "None that I can see"}, {"review_title": "Amazing company.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Marketing", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best benefits, work life balance is impossible to beat", "cons": "Nothing really that I am thinking about"}, {"review_title": "Everyone is eager to help", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 May 2022", "job_title": "Account Executive in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Helpful teams, free lunches/snacks/coffee, open pto, inclusion groups galore, ever-changing with new technology, and developing new ways to reach Job Seekers.", "cons": "I have yet to see any."}, {"review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Recruiter in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great org and culture.

They don't look deeper into the numbers, and don't derive any real value from their numbers. i.e. Markets reaching their targets is a simple yes or no. No deeper analysis into how and why. \nAnother example, Indeed wants to grow and get 'closer to the hire' because they've noticed the recruiting industry is much larger than what they have been aiming for. They didn't analyse their value to their clients, but simply decided to throw a product in to 'get closer to the hire' that hardly works.\n\n-The pay and benefits at other Tech companies in Dublin are way better.\n\n-This would, partially, explain why Indeed has a hard time attracting or keeping skilled personnel. There had been a hiring freeze for a year and a half, and the departments kept shrinking, while the work kept piling up.

From a CS rep's perspective, this means that you were most likely placed on a different team, with a different manager, with different sales partners, with different accounts, and no pay adjustment.\r\n\r\n6. Indeed CS has a practice of putting people in \"Interim\" Manager or Team Lead roles and not paying people for the work that they are doing. For example, a Team Lead may work as an Interim Manager for several months without being paid like a Manager. In my opinion, this practice needs to stop.\r\n\r\n7. For some reason Indeed has made it extremely difficult to transition from Inside Sales CS to Enterprise CS even though it's essentially the same job. For people that don't want to follow a leadership path, transitioning into Enterprise CS is pretty much the only way to see meaningful career growth within CS. So if you can't transition to Enterprise and you aren't interested in being a CS leader at Indeed, it's in your best interest to move on to a new company.\r\n\r\n8. Indeed leadership has a way of guilt tripping you into thinking that there's no other company like Indeed, the grass isn't greener elsewhere, etc. That's completely false. There are so many awesome tech companies in New York, Austin, and the Bay Area that have the same or even better perks than Indeed and pay significantly better.\r\n\r\n9. I appreciate that Indeed as a whole seems to value inclusivity and diversity, however, I wish that a senior leader would have taken the time to reach out and talk to me 1:1 about diversity and inclusion related topics, even if just for 15 minutes. That would have meant so much more to me than hearing about it at another All-Hands meeting or any other group setting. Personally, I don't want to hear a white man or woman telling me what needs to be done to improve diversity without them having listened to my input first."}, {"review_title": "Love this Job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is an amazing company to work for.

They tell me what my salary range is, don't make excuses for not hiring qualified women and minorities into senior leadership, and actually let go of people who are incompetent and/or make others feel uncomfortable to the point that they don't want to show up to work (read: harassers, sexists, homophobes, racists, and the like).
