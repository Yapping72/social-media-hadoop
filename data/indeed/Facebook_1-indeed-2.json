Additionally, you may have a Manager/Director who will tell you that your feedback is valuable, but will in turn negate any feedback you share; no matter how tactfully you\u2019ve presented it. In some instances, feedback given has been used to negatively impact employees during quarterly reviews. This kind of gaslighting is disappointing, but it's what you can expect if you plan to work in the San Mateo office. \r\n\r\nFurther, there is blatant favoritism amongst Managers/Directors, even to the point of promoting less experienced Indeed employees to senior positions. Given how political the office culture is, it's starting to resemble high school as opposed to a professional working environment. Managers will often be involved in conversations that are inappropriate for a workplace, and given the corporate structure, there is little that can be done without repercussion.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in switching departments, or further developing from the role in which you begin, this is likely not the place for you. It seems to me that Indeed relies on its brand name to attract new talent and indoctrinate new hires into believing that Indeed values more than just its bottom line. In reality, when employees find that this is not the case and leave, this never-ending cycle continues to perpetuate. Many of our most senior employees (3-4 years) have already left Indeed for this reason-- including a CS Manager, who helped influenced the San Mateo office in a positive way.

The idea is that, so long as you're meeting or exceeding your targets, you can take additional time off so long as it won't negatively impact the team or the clients. There were times when my team had precious little work to do, with very few people off, and I still couldn't take additional time off. \r\n\r\nYou get a performance-related bonus each quarter, but they keep changing how this is calculated, so I've been getting less and less each quarter despite having the same or better performance. \r\n\r\nThe systems we use (custom crm, even the indeed website itself!) are full of bugs and get in the way of you going your job. They've been 'fixing it' since I started and they're only now getting close to using a proper CRM. \r\n\r\nIndeed create a great image on linkedin and other sites, but the reality is very different.

The culture of the office is in shambles, no music, no talking to each other,  if you are in the kitchen making tea for more than 2 minutes, you will get questioned\r\n4.

Senior leaders that swear at reps and use vile language, don't get reprimanded\r\n7. A lot of school yard bullying\r\n8. HR want you to address thing with them.. they probably only want to do that so they can gage what head count they need for all the unhappy reps that are thinking of leaving.\r\n\r\nThe list goes on....  \r\n\r\nOne thing is for sure, you will make the business money, but in the end you won't get rewarded.

You can build up resilience by working here.\r\n\r\nThe positive reviews on here are  not true at all.  I read them and the only people that talk that way are managers trying to salvage what is left of the place. A lot of the negative reviews are deleted as Glassdoor is a sister company of Indeed.

Acquisition still gets commission and bonus. Growth does not get commission, only bonus (and has to hit a higher threshold than acquisition to get a bonus). With unachievable targets, most growth reps are pretty much stuck on low base salaries at the moment. \r\n\r\nOn top of the structure change that never made sense for the Australian market, there is an upper management team that has a poor attitude. Upper management finds it appropriate to swear at staff in front of a whole Monday morning meeting, which brings me to HR. \r\n\r\nHR seems to be biased, as they never asked upper management to apologize to the sales floor after that swearing incident- which would be considered bullying and intimidation (based on the bullying and harassment training they have staff complete yearly).\r\n\r\nThe mental health of employees is at risk at this place, since the change to the new structure, and new management in the last year, a lot of sales reps have spoken about the anxiety they are experiencing. These are people that have never had anxiety before working here. \r\n\r\nTo top everything off, the culture is gone in most sales teams.

Once Indeed was bought out, they totally lost sight of what actually matters in sales - SALES. They are forcing all of their strongest sales reps out by letting their sales \"leaders\" (managers) ruin the experience for everyone. They have no long term plan and seem to take things day by day. Their sales managers, besides the ones that were promoted internally, have never sold PPC advertising and don't bring any value to the company. They are, in reality, just stat checkers who's primary responsibilities consist of micromanaging and forcing people to make 60 calls a day despite what their day consisted of or how much revenue they bring in. This forces everyone to make fake phone calls throughout the day. Literally, EVERYONE, spends hours of their day making fake phone calls when they should be focusing on selling new business and growing existing accounts.\r\n\r\nThey do not care about the amount of meetings you set, amount of deals you bring in, or revenue sold. They only care about the number of calls that you make. This really just shows how they lack management experience and the ability to think logically. They promise big things to people that are interviewing, but the reality is that you will likely be fired or leave Indeed within the 1st year. Only around 5 people (out of 100's of sales reps) were promoted in my time being there which shows that it is either \"up or out\" at Indeed. Most of the time, it's out. This has ruined the morale. I did not know one single person that was happy working there.\r\n\r\nIt's really a shame that Indeed has gone this direction. Their turnover is horrendous, but they hide those numbers by forcing people to quit by paying them off to say they resigned rather than actually firing them. Additionally, the sales managers are highly unprofessional. They corner you in a conference room so they can yell, curse, and scream at the top of their lungs. They have no idea how to motivate and instead just make everyone feel like they are not good enough. In other words, no matter how well you are doing or how much effort you put in, you should be doing better. Nobody last 2 years in sales here besides a few people recently. These people will leave Indeed in the next few months if not promoted, and Indeed could care less.\r\n\r\nIf you have a good job or a job with any type of security, stay away from Indeed.

About every 2 weeks someone is either fired or leaves, and about every 3 months a director usually takes off to a more stable company. \r\n\r\nThe Turnover is due to a couple of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. No Leads For Salesman \r\n\r\nIndeed has the attitude that all their salesman should find their own leads. Going into the job you know this full well. Yet they don't tell you how atrocious and overworked their potential clients are. Prospecting takes up a good portion of your day and most often you have to do it after work, on weekends and holidays in order to find a few companies that haven't been called 20 times before you. A good lead is usually passed from director to Account Executive, but usually all the leads go to one or two chosen reps on your team....leaving you with nothing. \r\n\r\nExample: Someone had recently left the company making their book of business or prospects up for grabs. Yet, the directors have the ability to distribute the leads as they see fit. There were about 9 people on our team. All said and done two or three reps got the majority of the leads (About 60+), while the rest of us got about 5. Extreme imbalance.   \r\n\r\n2. Unrealistic Quotas \r\n\r\nIndeed is trying to reach figures that for more then 50% of their sales force they are impossible to reach. And they are trying to make it harder for their sales reps by placing package limitations and very high minimums for prospective clients this coming year. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Management \r\n\r\nIndeed's director's are very inexperienced and have little to no experience managing a team. Indeed basically promoted the salesman who were a part of the company a few years ago, when the sales floor wasn't so crowded. They do not know how to manage a team. \r\n\r\nThe Pay\r\n\r\nIndeed pays horrible when comparing it to other tech companies. Their base pay for their new  salesman is way below the average. Throughout the recruitment process and early on in your training you will commonly hear that you will make 80k-120k. This is pretty much false. \r\n\r\nTake it from my experience...\r\nMy training class had 10 people in it. Over a 6 month period 4 people had left, out of the 6 that stayed, only 2 were making quota. And this is at the point were your quota is not fully rampped up to the full amount you will have to reach after a year of being with the company. \r\n\r\nNow, out of the original 10, only 2 stayed and 1 out of those 2 is hitting quota. \r\n\r\nPlease look elsewhere and do not take a job with Indeed.com. The recruiters sugar coat the company to make it look far more stable then it actually is. But in reality they are just putting lipstick on a pig. Do not take a job with this company.

The push to be a Fortune 500 has left most of the company's values to the wayside.\r\n\r\nA new product emerged within the company and it was forced upon us, the account executives, to be the BDRs for the product with an inadequate compensation structure. It's being shoved down SMBs throats with costs that are inappropriate for businesses of that size and the reps being put on plans if the numbers are not obtained. Quotas are starting to become unattainable with zero insight on how they are created although it's been asked to expose this from the reps. There are TWO CRMs being used with duplication of the same records to be inputted taking up time. The hyper-growth of hiring QoQ is starting to reflect in reps books where worked through accounts appear more and more leading to dead-ends, but same quotas expected.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the sales leg has flipped a 180 in the wrong direction in a matter of a year with a grim outlook and the lost focus on consultative selling to an aggressive sale with inappropriate solutions for our clients.

Most people will stay in the same job most of their stay at Indeed, or will be offered a symbolic senior promotion, which is actually not a new position, but will just bring in a little more money for the same job. I believe Indeed should provide proper opportunities for their staff to grow and no try to sell fake promotions to their staff as the greatest opportunities. \r\nBesides the aforementioned lack of opportunities, I have seen new positions being opened up, and subsequently withdrawn after an offer was made to internal employees. This is due to the fact that the senior management in the U.S. lacks proper communication skills. Most of the decisions of restructuring are made within the realm(s) of their office, without informing the affected departments. Subsequently, these departments still under the impression of business as usual create new positions or introduce other new guidelines. Even though the senior management is aware of this, they still do not communicate. This will inevitably result in people becoming disillusioned. \r\nThirdly, I have witnessed on a number of occasions that major decisions are introduced by the senior management on a really short notice, e.g. 2-3 weeks before it has to be implemented. Usually the team leads do not know what is going to happen until the last minute. For instance a few months ago a structural change was announced in the sales department 3-4 weeks in advance, without providing any details. This causes a lot of confusion and frustration amongst the staff, resulting in unnecessary pressure and stress, since people do not know what is going to happen to their salary and bonus. Also the team leads were unable to answer their questions since they are left in the dark as well by the senior managers in the U.S. \r\n\r\nIf you do not care about career growth, incompetent senior management, and if you are happy to do the same job for years, this is the place for you."}, {"review_title": "Great work/life balance and culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Sept 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "ndeed was a fantastic place to work.

There is NO lead generation and most good companies have been beaten to death.\r\n- 60 call/150 min minimum. Yes this is achievable if you call fake numbers. Don't kid yourself everyone does and the management did. Is this the best way to run a company? Emails are not tracked and are by far the best way to communicate as people are way more responsive. \r\n- Young coworkers can be fun, but it also means a lot of gossip and cattiness. \r\n- Management is completely inexperienced and terrible. There was only one good manager. The others had so many issues I do not even know where to start. There is minimal training for them so they end up just micro managing you and not acting professional.\r\n- There is no help if you need it. It is a very sink or swim mentality. Your manager is just constantly interviewing people to fill in positions. I saw around 40 people leave in less then a year. High turnover=terrible moral. There were only a handful of people that were not looking to leave when I left.\r\n-They tell you there are growth opportunities, they lie. The recruiters and managers will tell you anything to get you in the door since people quit pretty much every week.\r\n\r\nI will leave it at that. If you think you will have a different experience, you wont. My advice to you- do not think to yourself that you will get more experience here. It is better to get in a position of just prospecting and working your way up at a good company that people enjoy working for. I PROMISE you that it will be way more worth it in the end and will not burn you out like Indeed.

A sales position is a way different environment than client services, product, engineering, etc. \r\n\r\nSales reps at Indeed do not have a long shelf life. Look on LinkedIn and see how many sales reps lasted less than a year and how many have been there for 2+ years. The retention rates are low for a reason. Sales reps are expected to make 60 calls every single day. It doesn't matter how much business you are bringing in, or how long you have spent on the phone that day. Emails do not count as a contact either. This isn't 1992. Glengarry Glen Ross techniques don't pay off. Emails are effective, but leadership doesn't care to understand that. Indeed longest running rep, that is a superstar, closes most of his business via email (introduction, not actual close) and they still don't want to hear it. How serious am I about the 60 calls a day? I know reps that have been fired for lack of call volume even though they exceeded quota. Sounds like a joke, but it's not. \r\n\r\nSince they went to territories, it has become more difficult to find leads. Most reps struggle calling the same tired leads day in and day out. Prospects get annoyed when the are called every day. There is money to be made here, but an individual sales rep cannot survive long term, especially those starting now. \r\n\r\nEven the sales directors don't last here. When I say good, I mean sales directors that work with there reps to hit quotas and improve themselves professionally. Directors that do well are stat checkers. I can't really comment on Sr. Directors as they weeded some of the worst ones pretty recently. The guys that are left seem to be ok, but I can't comment from first hand experience. \r\n\r\nI can't say enough good things about other functions of Indeed.
