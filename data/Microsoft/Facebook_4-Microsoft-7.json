Most people do not take a look at the depth of benefits that MSFT provides or take advantage of all of them (1200/year for wellness/hobbies, discounted eyeglasses at their internal eye doctor place, you get deep prescription drug discounts if filling at their pharmacy for example). Awesome other perks like use of the maker space, free yoga and wellness programs, even relationship or nutrition coaching.\nOpportunity to learn a ton in a short amount of time - 1 year at MSFT is equivalent to many more years at a mid-size business. You'll have access to a lot of learning resources online, through their library, etc - it's as much learning as you can cram into your brain although there may not be enough time in the day to prioritize it. \nMost people are very smart and talented, tends to be a very driven, results-oriented team of people which can be fun and motivated\nExcellent work life balance on my particular team but can vary depending on your team (Azure is not great at it for example) \nCompensation is not the highest in the industry but it is in the top 5, stock is on the up and up so financially the last year or so has been really advantageous.", "cons": "The main takeaway here is that this place is really stressful. Expect to grow some gray hair and also get good at managing your own stress. \nIn my organization planning takes 8 weeks of a 16 week quarter which is totally ridiculous.\nIf someone leaves the team, their work is just reallocated to everyone who is still there, backfills during the pandemic have been rare in my organization. This has led to a lot of people being frustrated and burnt out. \nThe sexism and racism is still real despite major efforts on the D&I front. Too many people who don't get it are in major leadership roles. Making actual progress on D&I issues can be insanely slow due to organizational size and lack of will. Senior Leadership Team (Satya etc) have a vision and want the right things, middle layers of management either don't care or might want to care but are so busy it's the last thing to ever get done. \nReview/Connect system has undergone changes and is supposed to be casual but isn't, ways to advance at the company are very murky. The old \"make alliances with the cool kids and promote yourself by sending status mails about your projects to look promotable\" is the best strategy to get ahead and that is unfortunate as it means a lot of the people in management are good at either manipulating people or ass-kissing but not actually good managers or good at their jobs. It is less \"stab people in the back to get ahead\" than it was but paths for advancement can be limited and confusing. \nRetention numbers of minorities, which they do not often publicize, are low.\nEvery person who was the best at their job on my team has left for Google or Facebook or to start their own company. Not sure MSFT is retaining best-in-industry talent (possibly because comp is better at other companies). \nPriority in my particular team is to make \"good enough\" solutions rather than great solutions. It can be frustrating to work with a lot of people who just want to keep their heads down and do whatever is easiest rather than what will end up being right for customers or right for long-term product development. Long term planning ability at MSFT is limited because changes are so frequent to organizations. \nOnboarding is non-existent, MSFT is a sink or swim environment. You might get an outdated OneNote with some notes from someone but I would not expect more than that as someone joining!\nAmount of time spent fighting fires is more than spent on regular job tasks. There can be interdepartmental sparring for resources, attention, because two incapable dudes who somehow became managers feel like it, etc. which can be frustrating."}, {"review_title": "Awesome Sauce", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Sales Associate in The Colony, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "awesomeness, with awesome of awesome", "cons": "don't allow drinking at work, nor dogs.
