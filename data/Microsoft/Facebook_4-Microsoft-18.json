Typically sales were performed by sales teams of various Product Specialist Technical Sales Experts and Account Managers. If a team lost a sale to a competitor, management would schedule a conference call with the team for a loss review. During the call the manager would often ask each member of the team who the weak link on the team is that caused the team to loose the opportunity.

Having come from an IBM culture where we truly worked as a team, watched each others back and typically had \"air cover\" followed up by coaching from our managers, I found the Microsoft throw each other under the bus mentality to be very detrimental to to building a good close cohesive sales team where the members were motivated to trust each other and work together in a positive way to be successful.

I don't mean the day you start, I mean DAY 1, in the interview loop. It depends on the manager and the team, but unless you want to work 24/7, you better tell them you value your work/life balance and that you don't check mail outside of business hours (of course there are exceptions). Most importantly, STICK TO THOSE BOUNDARIES when you've accepted the offer letter, and you're in the position. One reply from you on a Saturday or Sunday, means they'll always expect a weekend response. The same goes for vacation. Unless there is an emergency, vacation is to get AWAY from work. Do not respond to your email on vacation, or the cycle will continue.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Any support (admin) position, no matter what company or team, depends on the relationship between the admin and the manager. When your manager is laid off - the person who interviewed you, offered you the job, the person you MUTUALLY chose to work with, the person you've bonded with, built a strong relationship with, automatically know you both have each other's support - is gone. Unfortunately, there are plenty of other managers in the group that they'll shove you under. To be moved to a completely new manager, unwillingly (on both sides) has happened to me several times. At the time, if you hadn't been in a position for a year, you had to request permission from your manager to interview (they've recently gotten rid of that rule, but not in time for me to be laid off). If you decided to request permission, that automatically put a target on your back - so I was stuck until I was finally laid off.\r\n\r\n\u2022The pay for admins is lower than most companies, but the benefits do help take the sting out of that.\r\n\r\n\u2022Admins are always last on the list for raises. Yes, if you have a good review, you will get a raise. But it won't be very much.\r\n\r\n\u2022Yes, you'll work your butt off, some weeks will be crazy and other weeks you'll be twiddling your thumbs. Admin positions are hourly at Microsoft, which is actually an advantage because they get paid OT (time+1/2). However, during the \"slow weeks\", you shouldn't be penalized on your paycheck because there wasn't 40 hours worth of work to do. If your boss says \"why don't you go ahead and take the afternoon off, it's dead\", I'd take the afternoon off! If I needed the full 40 due to financial reasons, I'd make up things to do. That's a waste of my time and the company doesn't benefit either.\r\n\r\n\u2022There's definitely been a climate change since Satya took over. The Gates days were the good ol' days, the Ballmer days weren't as great, but still good - I don't have the confidence in Satya to lead Microsoft to success. We used to be and could be again, the best of the best! But I've seen Satya makes one bad decision after another, after another...\r\n\r\n\u2022 Every team is on pins and needles wondering who will be next on the chopping block. Morale is the lowest I've ever seen it. Something needs to change and revive what we used to be - Microsoft - a company I was always proud to say I worked for. Until now.\r\n\r\n\u2022Due to the \"climate change\", you have to look out for you. You'll be back stabbed, stepped on, thrown under the bus. Especially if you're better at your job that the other admins on the team - then you're a threat to them. For the most part, admins used to stick together, now it's eat or be eaten.\r\n\r\n\u2022Trust no one.

I have not observed women getting promoted and women from technical fields are rarely being hired.  Teams remain disproportionately male even compared to recent statistics from Google and other competitors.  Little effort is made to proactively recruit women in technical positions. Managers from my division regularly and openly discredit women.  They bully them (from my personal experience). It feels like Anchorman over there. The maternity/parental benefits are BS. I took them and it cost me a poor review (I was doing great before and in all prior reviews).\r\n\r\nIf you are in my situation, know that a lot of tech companies are proactively hiring women, publishing their statistics as cause for change, and rewarding women for their good technical work.  The underlying belief in other companies is that women have equal capacity to be technical and do technical work.  This is not the case at Microsoft.  Credit is frequently given to male co-workers on the basis of their arrogance and posture. The presumption is that technical contributions in collaborations come from men. This is promoted by managers at many levels. For instance, women are frequently required to justify more of the technical claims on patents then their male counterparts on similar patents.  The presumed inequality is part of everyday engagements.\r\n\r\nReal equal opportunity teams may exist in the company. Just be sure to interview your future Microsoft colleagues and understand the culture you are going into. I have excellent offers in other places now, and I am taking the one that best fits my personality and values. I know I will have a great impact there. I just wished I had moved out sooner from an environment that was toxic for my health. \r\n\r\nThere is no collaboration possible, and unless you are a very vocal person and snarky to a fault, more arrogant people steal the credit for your work. I have struggled with this lack of collaboration and very competitive atmosphere. I was hoping that with the Nokia integration, a more collaborative culture would influence Microsoft leaders, but unfortunately it did not happen and all of those guys got fired anyway.\r\n\r\nRegarding the interview process, the recruiter really tries to lowball you compared to other companies. This was my experience interviewing initially and then later interviewing internally.  Crap tactics like acting baffled and surprised at basic packages offered by many of their competitor companies are the norm.  Can they understand more collaborative techniques and work together on a good package? They do not reward PhDs.  They do not reward the caliber of the institution you're coming from. It is because most of the management lack graduate education and believe education is useless (I heard it many times at work). \r\n\r\nA minor thing, no free food, and food becomes quite expensive if you have only 20minutes to eat and need to eat in the local expensive cafeteria in the Commons (about 10-15$ a lunch). Something to budget.\r\n\r\nThe culture is really engraved in every manager who has been there from the start. Of course, you can find an excellent team (it does exist!) and if the work is a good fit, go for it.

MSGD is treated as lowest stock levels it used to start at 55 but now it starts as 56, all other companies under Microsoft like IDC, MSIT starts from 58 or 59. So overall you are valued lower at MSGD. How it will impact you->You will not get stocks of Microsoft in your package. also it will be problem if you want to switch to other groups like MSIT or product Team.\r\n\r\n2) Work Life balance is totally screwed here. As Microsoft their billing rates are very very high so to get projects they estimate very less so eventually dev team has to face that consequences and work day and night to complete project on time\r\n\r\n3) All projects are driven by consultants here, there are project managers are there who works like assembly line supervisors and try to put every thing on dev leads and test leads.

Satya is changing things, but not remotely to the extent the press narrative claims. Join Microsoft if you need a steady, boring job so you can raise a family \u2014 or if you don\u2019t have better options. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t come here if you\u2019re genuinely excited about being part of the next wave of technological innovation, or if you care about being at a fun, cool place to work. This ain\u2019t it. *\r\n\r\nWhen you see positive Glassdoor reviews for working at Microsoft, you should ask whether the reviewer has actually worked anywhere else. Microsoft typically hires people right out of college, who don\u2019t yet realize they\u2019re getting a bum workplace experience relative to our industry peers. It\u2019s not a coincidence that almost never will you meet people voluntarily departing a top-tier tech company like Google, Apple or Facebook to work for Microsoft \u2014 even though countless MS employees leave daily to these competitors.\r\n\r\nWhy is that? Microsoft has 4 major flaws for a young person excited about tech.\r\n\r\n1. IF YOU ARE YOUNG AND INSPIRED, DOING MICROSOFT LONG-TERM IS CAREER SUICIDE.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is a fine place to go for 3 years out of college to learn a new discipline - especially if you didn\u2019t get the GPA to go straight to a top-tier tech company like Google or Uber. \r\n\r\nBut Microsoft is a terrible place to stay for the long term \u2014 unless you really just want to have kids, a suburban house, and just need a day job to pay for all that. Doing a long-term stint at Microsoft destroys your marketability: you will have to fight in every interview to prove that you can survive in the agile, autonomous, resource-constrained, Android/iOS environment that is the real world. Companies will assume the worst of you in every interview. When you\u2019re ready to leave, it gets degrading fast.\r\n\r\nYeah, you ship Windows and Office to a billion people. Big impact opportunity, right? Well, McDonald\u2019s ships about 2 billion hamburgers each year. Wouldn\u2019t a job in McDonalds\u2019 headquarters also be a big impact opportunity? And if your idea of innovation involves years of making incremental tweaks to the Big Mac recipe, or wasting 3 years of your life to bring some executive\u2019s insane vision of a hybrid ice cream & chicken sandwich to market, sure!\r\n\r\nAnd the financial buffer of working at a monopoly means you burn 3-5 years of your working life on a single preventable fiasco like Windows 8 or Vista, during which your Silicon Valley friends just had the time of their life and got filthy rich helping create Uber or Airbnb. Instead, you\u2019ll be working on ridiculous projects that only make sense to Microsoft executives living in a suburban Redmond bubble. You will be the butt of jokes at parties with your college friends when you try to explain what you\u2019re working on (\u201cWait, so it\u2019s kindof like an iPad, but it has worse hardware specs, no software, it\u2019s buggy as hell\u2026 and it\u2019s more expensive than the iPad?\u201d). \r\n\r\n2. YOU DON\u2019T GET TO MAKE A DENT IN THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nAt Microsoft, you really won\u2019t change the world. Not a bit. You will waste months of your life trying to get organizational buy-in to do what would take days or even hours at a Silicon Valley startup.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is not a company that goes out and makes things better for customers, just out of employees\u2019 own passion or conviction. There is no love in the Microsoft workplace culture \u2014 it really feels like working at a fading monopoly whose primary mission is to figure out how to keep cranking out bucketloads of cash, in a new reality that no longer needs it. \r\n\r\nThis is what makes Microsoft such a boring and soulless place to work. You\u2019ll find soullessness in the dull, corporate posters in the hallways, the bland workspaces, and the uninspired cafeteria food. And with the cloudy, dark skies making for dark and depressing open-seating workspaces (Microsoft\u2019s last great perk of private offices is being phased out), it can sometimes feel like a real-life re-enactment of Apple\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d commercial.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft does an amazing job selling interns on the company \u2014 amazing parties, food, concerts, free hardware, and lots of executive face-time. If you\u2019re an intern, enjoy every moment of it. But remember that you\u2019ll never get any of that once you work for the company \u2014 all you\u2019re getting is a sales demo.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. MICROSOFT IS A TRADITIONAL, HIERARCHICAL COMPANY\r\n\r\nWhile tech companies are typically egalitarian and flat, Microsoft is traditional and hierarchical. This hierarchical workplace manifests in big ways, and in little ways.\r\n\r\nIn little ways, it just makes for a lousy work environment. In every e-mail you send, your job title and tenure rank (junior vs. midlevel vs. senior) appears at the bottom, so people can judge your ideas by your rank - just like the military. It means they serve the worst food of any tech company, since executives get personally catered meals and don\u2019t have to eat the dogfood-quality lunches food themselves. And it explains why the shuttle service that takes you around campus is a time-sucking nightmare \u2014 executives have special \u201c888\u201d shuttles that actually work.\r\n\r\nAnd in big ways, this means that if you have a great idea, you\u2019re probably not going to get it into a product - unless it\u2019s specifically your job or charter to do so. Microsoft doesn\u2019t want you for your creativity - they want you for your ability to shut up and execute on other people\u2019s (executives\u2019) ideas.\r\n\r\nIn fairness, there are small improvements like the new annual Hackathon. Yes! For just a few days each year, your original ideas and your creativity are valued! But there are other companies where your ideas and conviction are valued every single day.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. MICROSOFT DOESN\u2019T CARE ABOUT YOU\r\n\r\nYour immediate manager may care about you, but Microsoft as a company doesn\u2019t. Microsoft won\u2019t even do an exit interview when you quit. When you give notice that you\u2019re leaving for a \u201ccompetitor\u201d (basically, any tech company worth its salt), you literally are escorted out the door. Your health care and paycheck is also terminated that very same day. \r\n\r\nHR interview? Nope, you\u2019ll receive a survey that you literally can\u2019t even fill out \u2014 because it expires the moment your MS e-mail account shuts down (d\u2019oh!). They literally don\u2019t care why you left. \r\n\r\nIt sounds brutal, but Microsoft at its core is traditionally an unkind company. Until recently, they even required managers to give bad reviews to roughly 20% of their teams on a forced curve (\u201cstack ranking\u201d). When they ended this management practice, Microsoft\u2019s leadership never even had the humility to acknowledge or admit that this was ever a bad idea or unjustly hurt employees.\r\n\r\nWorking at Microsoft also means you\u2019re also stuck in Seattle. Competitors like Google let you work as an engineer in almost any exciting city in the world: New York, Munich, London, San Francisco - you name it, they have an office there. At Microsoft, well, you better love Redmond. At least it\u2019s only a 45 minute bus trip during rush hour to Seattle.\r\n\r\nWhile companies like Google lavish new toys and freebies on employees, Microsoft is dirt cheap with employees. The only \u201cfree\u201d hardware I got was a junky Surface RT (promised by Ballmer to be \u2018free\u2019, but then we had to agree in writing that it was actually the company\u2019s property and would be returned if we left), and a Windows Phone (which was only \u2018free\u2019 if we signed up for a nearly $2000 contract at the employee\u2019s sole expense - despite the unambiguous promise Steve Ballmer made at the company meeting of a \u2018free\u2019 phone. And true to Microsoft, they never explained or apologized for not actually giving employees what they promised us - as an MS employee, you\u2019re generally expected to just shut up and be grateful for whatever you get.)\r\n\r\nMicrosoft seeks to be a hardware maker, but offers marginal discounts to employees at best. You can get a better price on the internet for an Xbox or Surface. Whereas Apple gives employees $500 off a new Mac, Microsoft gives you nothing like that. Microsoft-logo\u2019d clothing at the company store costs as much as actual fashionable major-brand merchandise at a major clothing store.\r\n\r\n(This isn\u2019t necessarily a problem, as a noteworthy sign of the company\u2019s downward relevance is that almost nobody will ask you to buy MS discounted products anymore, certainly not compared to when I started.)\r\n\r\nIt just goes on and on.\r\n\r\nOverall, Microsoft isn\u2019t horrible - but if you\u2019re a talented young person who wants to make a dent in the universe, don\u2019t come to Microsoft."}, {"review_title": "Sensor SDET", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "9 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Senior Software Development Engineer In Test (SDET) in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are some really great engineers you can work with.

high senior, principal and beyond staff tend to have it good compensation-wise, so they don't leave very often, which can limit opportunities for those below them who want to move up.\r\nMany teams lack work life balance, but pay enough lip service to it that they won't admit it when you interview, so be careful; it is not unheard of for 60 hour weeks to be a norm, so consider that when negotiating salary; in rare cases, it can be worse than that.\r\nA bevy of smart people who may or may not have good social skills + very political culture in some groups = some of the worst, devious, cleverly-backstabbing-with-plausible-deniability politics you've ever seen in your life, as people fight to reach the higher levels and to stay there.\r\nSome fairly onerous engineering processes; I've heard Windows developers say they spend 12-15 hours a week coding and 25+ attending meetings, filling out database forms that are part of \"process\", talking with those who work on other components to ensure that their upcoming code changes won't break another part of the product, asking for permission to fix bugs.\r\nIf you're technical, you will laugh in disbelief when first exposed to some of our most-used internal tools.\r\nIf your history is not in Microsoft-created technologies, not all that you bring to the company will be considered useful.\r\nIf you don't manage to get into a situation where your management gifts you with a couple great reviews, compensation will be merely average or below.\r\nNegotiate well when entering, because raises here are at or slightly below inflation, while starting salaries for new hires tend to meet or beat it; after a few years, you may find new people with your skills coming in higher than you currently are.\r\n\r\nFor college hires:\r\nMinimal exposure to technologies not invented at Microsoft.\r\nA company that's pretty set in its ways and expects you to conform to it rather than giving you an opportunity to move it forward with new thinking.\r\nNo match for Google in the cafeteria or free snacks department.\r\n\r\nFor everyone:\r\nCompany's reputation is declining.\r\nCompany's stock price has been stagnant for a decade.\r\nExceedingly poor management in many areas of the company, sometimes to a toxic level; too many middle managers have instituted a lot of bureaucracy, committees, internal initiatives that justify their existence without adding value.\r\nThe necessity for most to venture into management to grow their careers; the technical IC advancement path doesn't have room for everyone who'd like to pursue it.\r\nSometimes what you are developing isn't particularly unique; it may have even been done, and done better, elsewhere in the company before, but for not-invented-here reasons and concerns about forking development paths, you can't easily share components among teams that are organizationally far apart as easily as you can when working in the open source culture.\r\nEntrenched culture at the top makes it difficult for good ideas to be heard and acted upon; leadership tends to play the risk minimization game, and changing the status quo is seen as a risk.\r\nSo many encumbrances that the company moves slowly - potential legal liability, anti-trust, P/R concerns, worries that product A in division B could cannibalize sales of product X in division Y.\r\nSome confusion at the company about the role and technical competence of managers; some teams assume managers are the team's technical experts, when they're not; this can result in poor decisions.\r\nReview structure in which one is pitted against one's teammates for the larger portion of two aspects of review compensation, stock awards (the other, the yearly bonus, is not nearly as \"curved\" as stock awards); review compensation decisions can be very arbitrary at the whim of your manager, and more dependent on nepotism and politics than performance.  When going into the company, it's more important to choose a manager you can work well with, than it is to choose the perfect job, for that reason.  Also, if you're on a team of strong performers and you are not the strongest, you can be penalized.\r\nRelated to that, managers have been known to \"cook\" reviews by assigning critical, high-visibility features to their favorites at the beginning of the year, so that those people are in the best position to get the good reviews at year end.\r\nOn-site cafeteria food in Redmond is pretty bad overall, with a few notable exceptions; you'll need to drive to work if you want to eat lunch at one of the fast food places a mile or two away.\r\nThe traffic in the area; the fact that most Microsoft employees who live in Seattle all come over the same several-lane bridge across the lake, along with everyone else who lives in Seattle but works on the Eastside.\r\nSalaries in most cases accommodate buying a nearby condo, but often not a nearby home; many people have 30-60 minute commutes each way to have a detached home or townhouse they can afford; real estate prices here are through the roof, though not as badly as in Silicon Valley.\r\nFor many, due to commutes and excessive work required, not enough free time to use the gym.\r\nBecause the company has so many smart employees, being smart and making an occasional great contribution is not enough to stand out here, although it is at many other companies.\r\nStock awards vest over 5 years for rank-and-file, leading to significant golden handcuffs; those at the partner level have accelerated vesting schedules.\r\nDental coverage is $1500, and dentists tend to expand procedure costs to fit that limit, so if you need several procedures, it costs you out of pocket."}, {"review_title": "Keep up the good work, pay attention to the areas of improvement", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Nov 2008", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer In Test (SDET) in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to work with some of the smartest people around.\r\nYou get to play with some of the latest technologies.\r\nYou get to work in some really good environments.\r\nYou get your own office.\r\nYour working on products with long term strategies.", "cons": "Have to deal with a lot of politics where often times the person doing the hard work doesn't get the credit he or she deserves.\r\nYou're in a massive company, with labrynthine org charts.\r\nSometimes a very cool idea gets shot down by legal.

Like every large company there's a fair amount of dead weight, but most of the folks you will work with are very good, and a large number are truly rocket-science smart. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft's software is, in most areas, better than it's ever been-- concerns about MS stuff not being enterprise-ready have largely gone away, and the awfulness of Windows 98 and Vista are thankfully behind us.", "cons": "Many parts of the company are disconnected from the customer and are too internally focused-- worrying more about what other groups are doing than what customers need.  The result of this is frequent re-organizations, randomization, and throwing away work as one executive wins a political battle and changes priorities of the last guy.  This is not true in all teams-- many are more stable-- but it's frustrating to see so much time being spent on internal priroities.\r\n\r\nMany product units produce phenomenally good work. SQL Server, Visual Studio, and ASP.NET are good examples of this, as is Office 2007 and, increasingly, Exchange and even Windows Server.  Any of these products, were they standalone companies, would be hugely successful market leaders and would be, I suspect, widely admired and emulated.  But the company has struggled to transform individual product success into customer loyalty for Microsoft overall.  For many years, the company has been defined-- in the media and in the minds of most customers-- by its failures and excesses: the DOJ/Netscape mess, failures in Search and Mobile, the Vista debacle, etc.  Unless the company can figure out a more positive story to tell to the world, it will be increasingly hard to convince people that Microsoft is relevant. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft's traditional business model (selling software licenses) is under serious attack-- MSFT has several more fat years left (signficantly, Windows 7 is sure to be a hit, and SQL Server will continue to take $billions from Oracle) but Open Source and the LAMP platform are slowly but surely commoditizing much of the traditional software business. The presence of Linux, MySQL, etc. won't prevent people from buying software, but they will surely exert continuous downward pressure on license costs, destroying the fat margins of traditional software companies.  This will likely hurt Oracle and other higher-priced vendors worse than it hurts Microsoft, but the days of 90% margins on selling software licenses are numbered.  So Microsoft has a huge challenge ahead: how to transform itself from selling software to selling subscription services powered by software.  Think Salesforce.com.  Unless Microsoft can make this shift in the next 5 years, it's doomed. \r\n\r\nThe job market for experts in Microsoft technology really stinks right now, unless you want to work for a one of the large companies who are heavy users of Microsoft's stuff.

But unclear long-term future for the company...", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 May 2009", "job_title": "Principal Program Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Even as a junior employee, you get lots of responsibility and can positively affect the lives of millions of people. \r\n\r\nYou get a really good education in how to ship software. In most groups, you become ruthlessly pragmatic and realistic about what's hard and what you need to do to ship. Microsoft toughens you!\r\n\r\nMost parts of the company are a meritocracy-- smart people rise to the top\r\n\r\nMicrosoft seems to, better than almost all large companies, be self-aware enough to recognize its mistakes, to get rid of executives who screw up, and to honestly understand industry trends and adjust to them. These adjustments sometimes are slow, but they do happen. \r\n\r\nYou get to work with some truly talented and very smart people. Like every large company there's a fair amount of dead weight, but most of the folks you will work with are very good, and a large number are truly rocket-science smart. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft's software is, in most areas, better than it's ever been-- concerns about MS stuff not being enterprise-ready have largely gone away, and the awfulness of Windows 98 and Vista are thankfully behind us.", "cons": "Many parts of the company are disconnected from the customer and are too internally focused-- worrying more about what other groups are doing than what customers need.  The result of this is frequent re-organizations, randomization, and throwing away work as one executive wins a political battle and changes priorities of the last guy.  This is not true in all teams-- many are more stable-- but it's frustrating to see so much time being spent on internal priroities.\r\n\r\nMany product units produce phenomenally good work. SQL Server, Visual Studio, and ASP.NET are good examples of this, as is Office 2007 and, increasingly, Exchange and even Windows Server.  Any of these products, were they standalone companies, would be hugely successful market leaders and would be, I suspect, widely admired and emulated.  But the company has struggled to transform individual product success into customer loyalty for Microsoft overall.  For many years, the company has been defined-- in the media and in the minds of most customers-- by its failures and excesses: the DOJ/Netscape mess, failures in Search and Mobile, the Vista debacle, etc.  Unless the company can figure out a more positive story to tell to the world, it will be increasingly hard to convince people that Microsoft is relevant. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft's traditional business model (selling software licenses) is under serious attack-- MSFT has several more fat years left (signficantly, Windows 7 is sure to be a hit, and SQL Server will continue to take $billions from Oracle) but Open Source and the LAMP platform are slowly but surely commoditizing much of the traditional software business. The presence of Linux, MySQL, etc. won't prevent people from buying software, but they will surely exert continuous downward pressure on license costs, destroying the fat margins of traditional software companies.  This will likely hurt Oracle and other higher-priced vendors worse than it hurts Microsoft, but the days of 90% margins on selling software licenses are numbered.  So Microsoft has a huge challenge ahead: how to transform itself from selling software to selling subscription services powered by software.  Think Salesforce.com.  Unless Microsoft can make this shift in the next 5 years, it's doomed. \r\n\r\nThe job market for experts in Microsoft technology really stinks right now, unless you want to work for a one of the large companies who are heavy users of Microsoft's stuff. Smaller companies, especially web-focused ones, especially in the Bay Area, just aren't using Microsoft's servers.  As a result, after 10 years at Microsoft as a senior, highly-technical expert I'm facing up to the reality that my next job will almost certainly be at a company running Linux Servers, MySQL databases, Java middle tier apps, and PHP/Rails/JSP/etc. on the web tier.

Once you've put on a few years and pass 40 years old. This pace starts to take a toll on you. In fact, you don't really see too many employees here past the age of 40. You rarely see a person over 50. \r\nThere's a ladder system of levels and an upward slope. As long as you can maintain a good pace and advance climbing the ladder at a reasonable speed you're fine. There comes a time when you pass 40 years old that you reach your personal maximum level. The company career process is not equipped to deal with that. If you \"level out\" on your climb and it looks like you won't reach the next rung on the ladder, then you start being treated like dead wood. There's no place for a jouneyman engineer at MSFT.

Pay is similar now to lots of companies.  And a lot of the pay is rolled up in your annual review, which includes a bonus and stock.  the bonus is below average and the stock only vests 1/5 a year.  So while your stock is part of your 'raise' you don't get any until 6 months to a year later.  And if you leave MS, you lose it.  So it is really a Con.  Healthcare is good but no longer free.  Employees have to pay out of pocket now based on HSAs and are taxed on employer paid portions.  It is viewed as a cost containment not a benefit anymore.    I hear from old colleagues they get better pay and benefits when leaving MS.

Most people at the company do a fine job, but like every other workplace, certain individual stand out. The are rewarded accordingly.

On the surface 99% of employees are simply unwilling to do that, because they believe they are a 1 or 2, and everybody else are the 4's and 5's. \r\n\r\nThis is a large company, and your success is largely dependent on relationships and your ability to connect with your peers.

The top echelons of compensation are epic; competition is fierce and winning is defined by profitability which has led to thinning of the product herd to only the most obviously profitable (or necessary) investments.  Satya's leadership has hope of changing this but when you see references to Microsoft's environment being \"toxic\" this is the root cause with the old stack ranking system in a supporting role.\r\n\r\nWork life balance is clearly your problem.  If you are ambitious and/or energetic there is always benefit to trading the work/life balance for work but it can eat you alive.  Do not look for your organization to guard your own work/life balance, it's up to you (as it should be but be cautioned)."}, {"review_title": "Microsoft is a great company to work for with a lot of excellent engineers", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "9 Oct 2014", "job_title": "Lead Software Development Engineer In Test (SDET) in Bellevue, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits have been watered down from what they used to be, but still are very good.  The deductible at the beginning of the year is high, but MS contributes and I've never had a problem finding a doctor that's part of the system.  The company culture varies from division to division, but generally its supportive and cooperative.  There are cases where people were promoted that I didn't feel should have been, but they were fairly rare so by in large, promotions were earned and justified.  Even more rare were the cases where someone should have been promoted and wasn't.  When I was promoted, the benefits were good, generally a 3-5% salary increase (+ merit on top of that), 15%+ bonus (depending on level), and equity shares.  As for people, I worked with a lot of different teams and I didn't get along with everybody, but I always felt the vast majority of people were very smart and talented.", "cons": "A big problem toward the end of my tenure at MS was process and compartmentalization.  I'm sure this is a problem with a lot of large companies, but I felt over the years that different groups were spun off to tackle different problems during the shipping of Windows.  This sounds good, but in practice it leads to conflicting priorities between groups with the focus less and less on the end goal of shipping a quality, innovative product.  For example early on in Windows, test and dev teams owned their own test labs and machines.  Now its set up such that there is a lab team and an execution team and their priorities are to keep the lab clean and machines busy, which isn't always the best thing for the dev/test teams trying to ship a product.\r\n\r\nAlso, another thing to watch out for is competition.  MS competitive review model can lead to grandstanding and throwing people under the bus for the sake of ones own review.  Some competition is good, but not when it leads to these negative results, which I have seen.\r\n\r\nLast I would say is honesty of execs.  Because of the layoffs and the way they were handled by execs, the morale of the Windows group is pretty low.

I\u2019ll try to leave emotion out of it and share the historical events that occurred to remain truthful and not exaggerate. When I first came in as an MBA here, I was brought into my dream finance role. 24 hours after joining, my manager went on paternity leave for about 8 weeks. I heard from him a couple of times in that timeframe and that was about it. I got started working on some onboarding projects and everything was more or less fine. My office was on the other side of the building so I didn\u2019t get to sit next to my team for the first 7 months. My teammates never really came by to say hi so it was tough to build new relationships with them, having to walk over constantly to try to connect. After my manager returned, he only talked to me a handful of times. I\u2019d say I sat in about 8 hours worth of 1-1\u2019s over my whole year there. I never received a performance review or feedback on a single project. I never received a quarterly or year end performance review. I never heard that I did well, but was reassured that that wasn\u2019t my manager\u2019s style. He\u2019s never really one to say \u201cgood job\u201d. Not great management. I never felt like I was wanted in that role, and I heard from numerous people that I was placed in that role by a recruiter and was never actually placed in an open role and thus I wasn\u2019t really wanted from day 1. \r\n\r\nNow for the part that I still am just in shock around. In my organization, I was the only white person. About 3 different times, in team meetings, jokes were made about how I wouldn\u2019t understand something or couldn\u2019t relate because I was white and not Asian/middle eastern. I just brushed it off and laughed, but felt like I experienced a form of racism that I had never felt before. Having not felt like part of the team ever and then had them make jokes about my race at my expense... it really didn\u2019t feel good. But, because I\u2019m Caucasian and not something else, if never felt like I could say anything about it because it\u2019s Seattle and many people believe racism against Caucasian people isn\u2019t possible. I would disagree based on my experience.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of my time, after declaring I was leaving, I never heard from a single HR rep. I had so much I needed to share and I didn\u2019t even get an email about my departure.  Nothing. Zero. No form of exit interview. No goodbye. Nothing. So now I\u2019m sharing this all here because I didn\u2019t get to share it internally. It was the strangest exit I\u2019ve ever had. \r\n\r\nThe moral is: people leave managers, not companies. Microsoft is a spectacular company, but my management experience was really, really poor and HR really dropped the ball here. I was so sad too having come into my dream job and feeling unwanted completely from day 1. I would\u2019ve stayed if even one person showed that they cared in the least. I had shared this with multiple friends there on my last day who had been there for years and they were in utter disgust and shocked that HR had never reached out. They reached out on my behalf and even that didn\u2019t trigger a response. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m just really shocked and sad.

Newly formed product groups especially have a fun 'start up' atmosphere with a lot of cross-discipline collaboration and everyone working together to get the job done.  Full-time employees get very good health insurance.  Cafeteria food is good and there is a reasonable variety, though as with anything it does get old after a while.  The various campuses are generally nice and most of the buildings have enough windows to avoid the feeling of working in a basement.

While it can be nice to have managers understand the technical aspects of a project, very few good engineers go on to become good managers.  Unfortunately, Microsoft almost never puts managers back into an individual contributor role unless the person specifically requests it, meaning bad managers get shuffled around leaving discontent in their wake.\r\n\r\nWork-life balance can be seriously out of whack in some groups.  This goes beyond the normal crunch-time chaos; multiple projects + hardware development builds every 4-8 weeks can easily lead to 6-12 months of 60+ hr weeks.  Expectations for FTEs are always increasing, making it that much harder to maintain a work-life balance.  Whatever you did to go \"above and beyond\" in the last review period becomes the minimum bar for the next review.  \r\n\r\nThe review system fosters a competitive, rather than collaborative, environment.  There is little incentive to help peers succeed as each person is stack ranked relative to the others in the group as \"assists\" aren't tracked or measured.  If something goes wrong everyone scrambles to find somebody to blame instead of figuring out what happened and pull together to fix it.\r\n\r\nWith the economic downturn, MS cut contractor pay by 10-20% across the board.  At the same time, most groups have limited contractors to 40 hrs/wk, putting lots of people under financial stress.  Some managers are expecting their hourly contractors to put in an extra 10-20 hrs/wk, unpaid, to get the job done.

The pay for a summer intern is above the industry standard.\r\nThere is a lot of respect shown towards the work of all employees and interns alike. \r\nEveryone is doing real work.\r\nNo micromanagement at all. I was only told once in the beginning I was kind of expected to be at work from 10 to 4; however, I repeatedly showed up at work at 1 p.m. and there was not a single remark about it. (Of course, it was my problem when I had to work on some weekends to have the work done, but again, nobody was counting when I was working and for how long.)\r\nVery open structure, a lot of communication going on (not necessarily a plus for me, but Microsoft is very communication-oriented).\r\nGreat technology.\r\nEverything is optimized. Like, you think it might be a good idea how to improve something: signs in your building, meeting schedule, some internal rules - you send an email, and you immediately get a friendly response, and people start working on implementing your suggestion (or disucssing it) as long as you want it.\r\n\r\nSeems to be very fair for reviews, promotions, salary increases, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you are invited for an on-site interview, you will get reimbursed for everything. You can negotiate another day in the hotel, negotiate where you want to fly from and to, ask for another 5 free taxi vouchers, etc. They don't care what you where for the interview (or when you work there). They don't care if you have a weird haircut or sexual orientation. Only your skills, your passion for technology and for the customers, and your enthusiams matter. A lot of appreciation for the good work you do.", "cons": "Work was not challenging or interesting enough. A lot of code that is just doing routine things. It is not just Microsoft, however, it is necessary by the nature of the work. I am just not so much of an engineer, my background is in math and theoretical computer science, so I enjoy interesting things where you have to think, not just seeing technology work.\r\n\r\nYou have to be excited about your work. You do not have to work 14 hours a day (or even 10, really), but you do have to be excited and want to learn new technology, get a better developer (or a better Microsoft developer, more specifically) or getter tester, or manager, etc. This may seem like a good thing (and it really is!) --- but this is also somewhat forced. You have to identify where you want to grow (when you work there full-time) in a written form, then the company will help you - coach you, move you to another project, etc. You cannot just say \"I just want to work here for my 40 hours and get paid\". You have to find out yourself what you want to do. You have to load yourself with work, come up with new ideas, take the initiative, etc. This is required. So they are requiring and taking some of your emotional or spiritual energy in this way. \r\n\r\nToo much admiration for Microsoft. Gets annoying to see all those monitors and posters and emails, advertising, how happy is everyone is at Microsoft. Even though it is not far from truth,  a lot of people are very happy and very excited from working there.... - but this also gets annoying. Seriously, I cannot stand some many people claiming to be excited about their work every day, everyone from smiling drivers of the shuttle cars on campus to those working in the cafeteria, to researchers, developers, managers... It looks too good to be true, made me feel uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nDuring my internship I was not given enough information on what was expected of me. It took me some time to understand that people just expected me to take the initiative. For example, they may not tell you \"you have to do it by next Friday\" --- but you will have to ask \"what do I have to do and by which date?\" If you don't, they will think you don't know what's going on (because you don't care to ask around) so not interested, or you are not a productive worker. They will find somebody else to do the job, or the project will move slower (they have many projects; sometimes 2-3 teams, doing the same thing, so at least one can succeed :)), and you will get a not-as-great review and may be eventually asked to leave. Although, I admit, this is fair in a way. If you have the initiative, go for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lot of emphasis on getting the work done (which is good), but not as much on making people do what they are good at. The responsibility is totally on you. You have to figure out what you like and what you don't, what you are good at or not good at. You have to take the initiative. (Then, in many cases, you will actually be able to move to a position that you want.)\r\n\r\nMany developers, testers, etc. are, it seems, not too great in terms of their skill, as Microsoft is a big place. However, talent is always recognized, and people are always trying to get better. If your background is limited and you need to learn a lot, but Microsoft still takes you --- then prepare to work a lot, too. It may actually be a lot of hours every day. (Yet again, nobody will count, and you can do it at home.)\r\n\r\nRedmond location - there are some commute issues. Microsoft is working on that (like their \"the connector\" is a great thing), yet this will always be an issue.\r\n\r\nSo-called starbucks coffee is no good, and cafeteria food is average (I have seen pretty much their best cafetereia during the on-campus interview.)"}, {"review_title": "Microsoft can be a wonderful place to work if...", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "20 Oct 2009", "job_title": "Process Engineer in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Microsoft is challenging.

Kiss up to your boss big time, but remember he/she also needs positive reviews and so work something out on that front. The work is actually secondary to all this - thanks to all the newbys and contracters who do that.. \r\nThe calibration process actually determines what you will be paid and and more importantly if you will survive. Calibration is where you will be compared to your \"peers\" to see where you sit in that stack. If you are bottom of the pile your are history and if you are top or near (say top 30%) you have hit the microsoft jackpot. But the calibration process is a bit like a lottery as you you will be calibrated against everyone in your particular business unit (at your grade)  by management that may not even know you, and amay have there own personal favourites. That is why networking is such a big thing. The other part to this is there are quotas for each grade and there are currently 5 grades. This like a budget plan - 10% will receive 0 bonuses and increment and will be managed out of the company via a PIP (Personal Improvement program it means your gone) and 10% will be marked as the top talent. The others are the survivors with varying increments and bonuses depending on where they sat in the calibration.\r\nThe people that succeed at Microsoft are not necessarily the most talented but the most able to work the system and have the most successful network to inflence the calibration.  \r\nAn indication of the kiss of of death is to stay at the same level and role - you are expected to \"grow\" and extend yourself.

However of course if you don't want to do marketing, promotion, communications or advertising then you may prefer to work at a smaller company where those responsible for the marketing et al are specifically in such roles.The irony at Microsoft is many people in marketing are not very good at marketing their work; at best people don't know what they are working on, at worst they do market their work but it comes across as self promotional.

There are several people who are waiting for retirement and are working 10 am - 4pm hours.  This is hard because they tend to resist any change or are non-responsive if you email them at 4:01 PM.

Or a great platform with no ecosystem because the developer tools are hard to use.\r\n\r\nThe rat race - at some point in my 9 years, I subscribed to the idea of 'get promoted, otherwise I'm not growing!'  Because the entire pay grade and responsibility is tied to your level, it's somewhat true, but when people start working the system, they are merely trying to get promotions (visible projects, taking on responsibilities at the next level) and not deliver solid work at their current level.  I've seen projects where senior engineers were off trying to find things to get them to principle while they let their SDEs and SDE 2's architect the project.  The code was a mess and I was surprised it didn't deadlock more often, but these are things that could have been fixed if their seniors architected the project instead of making them do the cross-team integration work.  Not great if those engineers want to code but are being forced into PM-ish sort of roles.  It's easy to get sucked into the need of perpetual promotions."}, {"review_title": "12 Years at Microsoft as PM", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Senior Lead Program Manager in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Company has improved dramatically in the last few years since Ballmer's departure\r\n-decent pay, good benefits\r\n-lots of opportunity to do awesome work and make a huge impact in the industry\r\n-our culture is slowly changing for the better", "cons": "-work life balance can be poor\r\n-lots of process and layers of management makes us slow to react\r\n-lots of groups doing the same thing (slowly changing)"}], [{"review_title": "Depends on the manager and team", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Program Manager II in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are a lot of great technical geniuses at Microsoft, and the company has a great lineup of products and a ton of money to throw at new ideas.", "cons": "Despite the whole \"One Microsoft\" shift, there is still a lot of career based engineering going on in the culture.

You are well paid and benefits choice is great. There are opportunities for training, you have to seek them out other than mandatory training such as diversity and equality and so forth. In all I had some great experiences , worked with great people, and made very good money.", "cons": "You can be in a situation where things are ambiguous you have to deal with that and if you don't you will have a problem  , some managers will leave you literally on your own, and literally spend all their time managing up, one manager I worked for, for  six months , I saw her three times in six months.  It can be quite hard to get meaningful training as your workload is very high, and unless you have a manager that wants you to get on , you can run into a wall of indifference about your development. If you have a quota focus on that to the exclusion of anything else, don't let anything detract. There are battalions of lawyers that literally hold things up and have no recognition of commercial deadlines. Processes are tortuous, long winded, paper and system driven policed by accountants, lawyers, compliance etc , it can be very hard to make that process  move and you have to build relationships to do that. Basic things like paying a developer or supplier in a country outside your own can involve conference calls to up to 15 people. I left Microsoft this year as a part of the large redundancy program (17K) people overall. When you leave there are loads of promises that you will be helped to find internal roles, you wont be helped, HR say this but you are totally on your own, They also say they can extend your notice if you are in process for a role internally , they wont, they push the manager to make a decision literally after the interview,  they cant so you are unable to proceed. A job I applied for which I had two and half years on that product line, I interviewed for, and all seemed well , my feedback was  one line and I didn't get it , I then saw this job advertised two weeks later as  a contract role with a staffing agency word for word the same job description at 50% of my salary....   They also say when you are leaving you can extend to cover stock vesting they would not extend me for 9 working days (I requested this as unpaid) I lost 14000.00 as a result. HR are completely inaccessible you can only contact them via email, they never call back, they only do the absolute bare minimum and my advice is never expect anything from them at all ever and get everything from them in writing or it is meaningless. Ironically for the company that pretty much invented IT , internal tools such as getting access to resources, finding data, getting signed into programs and drives you need to access is again a painful process, you have to apply for logins that take ages to get approved, chase people to grant them and the processes can be clunky and slow. For example any pay query goes to outsourced providers who literally ignore the query, its all online , the answers when they come are ridiculously inaccurate reflecting the total indifference of the poorly paid staff in India that have to process these queries. Finally I would say you will move almost every year, and if your business unit is not doing well, look to move in the fiscal year early, as HR in their wisdom enacted the \"consultation\" period on Jun 1st this gave 30 days and then your notice started July 1st which is end of fiscal year, there are no jobs posted in July as all budgets come down 2nd /3rd week of July and new jobs are posted then. You will be left with literally 7-10 days to apply, interview,, and get to 2nd interview (near impossible).  If you recognize your business unit is doing badly look around and get moving as your bonus, job, stock is always at threat even if you are doing well personally, you can meet your target (I did) over 100% in first half of fiscal (Jun to Dec) business unit did badly Jan to Jun (2nd half of fiscal) even then I made bonus , makes no difference you are out. Don't assume you are safe as your business unit can disappear overnight. I moved four times due to restructuring in five years. MS Corp in Seattle is famously disconnected from international markets, it is not a global company it s a US company that tries to force US centric models onto international markets, quite one size fits all, and as a result lots of head scratching when things don't work ."}, {"review_title": "Great Work Environment but competitive", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "13 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting projects.
