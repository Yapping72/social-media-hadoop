PFEs have an Account Manager as a person manager, and they work with TAMs and often other Project Managers, Architects, etc. in the course of their work.  I notice that Account Managers are often not only maladroit with respect to Microsoft technology, but technology in general.  And they often are really poor managers.  Microsoft has a 'connect' process that HR instituted to force managers and employees to talk several times a year.  Often, Account Managers view this as a checkbox, and it's symptomatic if their not putting much effort into managing people.   TAMs are supposed to be Technical Account Managers, but often they are neither technical nor managers.  You can't have a grown-up conversation with TAMs, often, because they don't understand the technology.  They are supposed to be bridge between the customer and the technical PFEs, but I have seen a lot of slacker TAMs who actually just make PFEs life more difficult.  And I've heard customers say that they want the good work that PFEs do, but they don't want to pay for the exorbitant associated costs of having to also pay for ADMs, TAMS, etc. etc. Career advancement within various fiefdoms is not based on technical merit or utilization or even how valuable you are to your customer, but based on 'go along to get along' mentality and kissing up to management."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Cloud Program Manager in Redmond, WA",

You have the same VPs running teams there and they continue to perpetuate favoritism and sexism. There is no safety at Microsoft. You may be okay in a role for a while, until there is a re-org. A new VP comes in and replaces all the leadership with people they know. That job you were waiting around for? Gone. It's given to someone the VP trusts.\r\n\r\nCulture is also about how we treat each other. Office politics happen when there is a lack of trust in the workplace. Teams are still competing with the each other for resources. Within teams, managers are playing games to protect their own feature areas and resources. With respect to compensation, it gets worse. While MSFT can say they got rid of the stack rank, it's the same budget for rewards. It's not possible to give everyone a max payout with the budget. This means the VP takes from everyone to give top rewards to a few key performers.\r\n\r\n2) If you ever join MSFT, good luck finding your next job.

During my MBA we studied Jack Welsh, former GE CEO and Chief Executive Magazine \"CEO of the year\".  I recall Welsh noting that \"managers should have ten (10) direct reports at the minimum, and 30 to 50 percent more if they are experienced\" - that would be 12 to 15 direct-reports for a good manager.  The teams I worked with in Windows Division and Developer Division had only 3 to 5 reports for each manager.  Not only did this create on-going fiefdoms and turf battles but also lead to to excessive micromanagement.  Many managers provided little real value to their team or the company.  (And for many, their overriding focus seemed to be on their next promotion and bonus.)  Customer needs and what was best for Microsoft were frequently sacrificed for bogus features sold to make the manager \"look good\".  Once released, new products often fell flat so the next year they'd be off pushing some other idea (which often again, didn't meet any real customer needs).  (It seemed that many managers are just going through the motions and putting in time to get their tenured \"partner\" status.)  I got tired of the silly politics, fiefdoms, turf wars, and micromanagement.
