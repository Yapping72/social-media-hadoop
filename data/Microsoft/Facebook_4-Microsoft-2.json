Being the boss of your company means doing whatever it takes to bring good to your business. You can work with the people you want and assign them the positions they deserve in the company. Moreover, being the in-charge means you can conduct the business your way, deciding who to work with. While this isn\u2019t for everyone, but such advantages of running a small business are considerable. 3. Financial gain Micro-entrepreneurship lets you achieve higher financial gains than any other job if your strategy is hitting the button. Owning a small business means you have a big chance to be financially independent. Many entrepreneurs of this age find inspiration from millionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk. You get to decide your salary and perks as you are in charge of how much you can earn. 4. Hands-on Experience Apart from satisfaction, working from 9 to 5 can\u2019t give you the experience of running a business. As a micro-entrepreneur, you will get to learn at your own pace and faster. Freelancers and contractors such as consultants grow with a set of specific skills and keep maximizing their markets. Practice is the only key in an unpredictable market where nothing goes as planned. But the right execution at the right time always pays back. That's how you grow experience which is one of the shiny advantages of micro business. 5. Job Security Profit or not, nobody is going to fire you or penalize you for mistakes. With mistakes, you get to learn more. A small business can start with a small capital; there may be some financial setbacks in the worst-case scenario. As far as the job is concerned, there\u2019s nobody can take to it from you. You can accomplish business goals at your own pace, where the only reason you lose your job is if your business doesn\u2019t succeed. Pretty much depends on your hard work.

There are tons of problems that come your way while you choose to be on the streak of micro-entrepreneurship. 1. Limited Resources Since a microbusiness is started using a small of capital with just 4 or 5 members, it often lacks access to resources. The resources are necessary for a business to begin, particularly a lack of manpower. In a competitive market, you need both planning to attract a consumer base. This may be one of the common disadvantages of small businesses as Corporate Companies and LLCs have a better hold in the market having more access to resources. 2. Working Extra Hours is among common disadvantages of Microbusiness Sacrificing your personal time on your business is one of the major disadvantages of running a small business. Generally, you would have to work 50-59 hours a week. While you have the advantage to decide your work hours, there is no fixed time to schedule your own business. You may have to stretch working hours initially, focusing on establishing your business. 3. Multitasking Small businesses often have a limited number of members, from partners to employees. Oftentimes, you may have to deal with stuff you are not good at. Expect making coffee or doing the cleaning job on your own. Since you are the boss, it\u2019s your responsibility to fix the office space and make the faulty computers work. From encouraging the employees to dealing with finances, it\u2019s all up to you. Keep in mind that Multitasking can also be the biggest disadvantages of micro business when there\u2019s no one around with extra skills. 4. Choice Making The decision is the most important part of every business. Being an advantage of a small business can also disappoint you at times. Every decision you make directly affects the success of the business and employees. From choosing the suitable fit for the job to deciding the flow of funds, it has to be you who has to step forth. Investing in the wrong process can lead your business venture into shambles. 5. Commitment Let\u2019s face it; Microbusiness is not for everyone. Multitasking, decision-making, and doing things you haven\u2019t done takes a lot of legwork and planning. The biggest concern of starting a small business is investment. Fulfilling all the essential responsibilities and taking care of your family is like a double-edged sword. Not everyone is good at handling immense work pressure.

Personally I've used it to reimburse meal kits, a peloton subscription, pet insurance, and a massage envy membership. The list is really expansive. \n\nThe average tenure at MS on my team is around 7 years. People stay a really long time because the philosophy is that they'd rather have you take a break than lose all the expertise you've  gained. Being such a large company, the code bases are large and the history is long on pretty much all the projects. The longer they keep you, the more valuable you become. More on that in the cons.\n\nThere's plenty of room to move internally when you're ready to do something different, and internal hiring is very common.\n\nSpecifically on coming out as transgender at Microsoft:\nMy wife and I pay zero dollars for our health insurance and have a copay of $20 for any doctor in the Kaiser system. The trans healthcare is especially affordable -- just $100 for any of the gender reassignment procedures. The wait lists are about 6 months for a transgender surgical consult, which isn't terribly short but it's certainly worse other places.  \n\nThere's an internal transgender community that has worldwide members. They've been an incredible support and place to belong. Changing my name and pronouns has been completely painless. A lot of my team is virtual and I've never been misgendered or dead named. I didn't even announce it beyond telling my manager and saying in my team chat \"Hey I'm going by X now and updating my pronouns to y\" and everyone just said great, congrats, and started using it.", "cons": "The main complaint I hear from people leaving Microsoft is that they want to make more money or get promoted. \n\nAs I mentioned in the pros, turn over at MS is pretty low by design. But that does mean that compared to other places, the opportunity for promotion and big raises is smaller as well. Generally people either leave by year 2 or stay for 7 to 8 years at least. There's a lot of people who have been there for a very, very long time. \n\nAlso, good work life balance and culture is the stated goal at Microsoft and most teams seem to follow it, but not every team is the same. \n\nThere are a lot of different teams at MS and reorgs seem to be fairly common -- though it seems about the same as at any large company, not particularly bad here.\n\nMy team only just started doing sprints. For the previous year plus I've worked here, I've struggled without the framework of agile that I'd become used to at previous work places.

The executives may come from all different areas of the world, but they are all from similar educational backgrounds, which means it lacks diversity in \"thought\" and to push against that is very difficult, if you have been at Microsoft less than several years.  They recruit a lot of people to join the company, since they are losing people to the competition and better salaries, but people that have been at the company for more than 15 years, make it very difficult for new people with \"ideas\", so the politics are hard to navigate. There are people that are trying to bring innovation to the company, but most of them are frustrated and have given up trying to make any significant changes to the culture or innovation, until they can find a new gig. \r\n\r\nSince new people are not very much embraced by the people that have been there for a long time, progress is very very slow. Primarily, why Microsoft does well in the market, is because they have a good brand, due to the leadership of Satya, but that's the reason, not due to innovation.\r\n\r\nMany long-time \"Softies\" lack expertise in their work subjects, so they utilize agencies for most of the strategy and execution. If you really want to participate in the innovation of product or strategy, then I would suggest working for one of their many consultant agencies.\r\n\r\nPeople are on Microsoft Teams all day, every day. There's no respect for people's time and people are constantly late for meetings, since they are stuck on the previous meeting. Executives assume that all day meetings = work, which it doesn't.
