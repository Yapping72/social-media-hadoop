To thrive here and achieve success in terms of promotion, moving up roles, moving up in levels you need one of the following.\r\n1. Be a relative, friend, neighbor, family close to any of LT folks Delivery manger, Service practice leader, Director.\r\n2. Be a diversity.\r\nIf you are very hard working, politically right, not direct, flexible, intelligent and be innocent, you may have some success but not guaranteed.", "cons": "1. MS IGD is a private run tight knit group. The LT team has no backbone. They will never standup for their subordinates. This is very true especially in the middle management. Be it the Technical delivery mangers, delivery managers or practice directors.\r\na. Once you approach them with a problem, you will looked at against company, not have flexible mindset, problem creator. They won\u2019t speak up or try to solve your problem by arguing for what is right, because they don\u2019t want to offend their peers or managers.\r\nb. They bring their own people, friends and families. They want to keep promoting their ALs. I suppose you understand what AL means.\r\nc. They are incorrect collaborators in suit and coat. Most of the folks have been somehow caught warned when trying to take advantage of their diversity subordinate. \r\nd. They hires lot of machs and college interns. They spend on them taking them to parties. Why???? Because these people will give them good score in MS poll. This way they continue to exist. If these interns, college fresh hires wake up and stand for themselves, the workplace would be much better. They are the future citizens, and they should not get enticed by cheap money, alcohol and shut up. This is how our nation is being managed. Shut the young up and they realize things are out of control. This is how our country was ruled by keeping the young in the dark.\r\ne. The internal job posting is one of the biggest joke. Do you know where you will be posting for job that is already filled in or taken? It\u2019s an eye wash. Name sake they will interview.\r\n2. Msigd Has Been Polluted By Former Msit People\r\na. There was a organization called GDCI a decade back. This was called as global delivery center India. It became msit later. This team was then merged back to idc later. Now around early 2008 - 2010 many employees copied the CEO, LT of msit, idc and mgsi and sent communication on the reality. These employees exposed how the local people abused other state people, how they promoted their own dna, family friends and built an empire.\r\nb. When this information become wide spread, few people from msit started moving into igd. They started building the same people. This folks, mfs, took on positions like engagement managers, professional development and resource managers and practice leaders and directors.\r\nc. They then converted igd like msit slowly.\r\n3. Only ALs gets promoted, encouraged\r\na. Soon the same mf, LT folks encourage only people who will do al.\r\nb. They will give 0 rating for people who speak up.\r\nc. They will reprimand people who escalate on folks who are poor performers.\r\nd. They will only encourage diversity colleagues that\u2019s HR policy\r\nAll of us need to work 200% to make up for their diversity counterparts. I have also worked and managed many diversity who are real gems. Some of them colleagues are extremely talented, with high aspirations. But the other half need the pass to get promoted, get hike and survive.\r\n4. Its NOT IDC\r\na. Unlike the lt in idc the lt in igd are non technical, sales, and non it managers who joined from other indian based service companies managing herds.\r\nb. Idc lt is made up of talents similar to our CEO. They were once developers, program managers, product unit mangers and group managers. The mgsi, msgd, igd (multi named ms igd) have leadership who ever managers, team leads in companies like satyam, infosys, wipro, tcs. What can you expect?? \r\nc. The type of work in ms igd is that of pure consulting. Its about passing information from here and there, understanding customer, selling yourself and your team, lobbying ms products, delivery some solution to the customer. Unlike idc where there is lot of technical work, and hands on hard core development\r\nBetter together in this journey and better further from igd, Take care."}, {"review_title": "Microsoft experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Program Manager in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing culture and wonderful leadership team", "cons": "Low pay and slow carreer growth"}], [{"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Senior Program Manager in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, competitive pay for Seattle area (ONLY), ton of opportunities to explore and grow", "cons": "lack of growth mindset, inexperienced managerial workforce"}, {"review_title": "Fantastic company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Program Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everything.
