Management have no interest in helping you progress, the only way you can progress is to rat on your colleagues back to management, boot lick, hard work is not recognised only numbers and if the metrics don't add up you're not doing your job, work quality suffers as a result then they get on your back, the constantly change the goal posts and don't pay you extra for working bank holidays.\r\n\r\nThey can't leave you to do your job you are highly harassed and micro managed to the point of breaking. \r\n\r\nEven your own colleagues will be looking through the ticket system to see what other colleagues are doing, interfering with their work and hanging them to management if they feel they thought they were doing something wrong, this is the culture they nurture in Microsoft. \r\n\r\nNepotism is rampant and this has created a gigantic click which see people get promotions who don't deserve it. People who haven't a clue, just in the door next you know they're giving you orders.\r\n\r\nYou are forced to watch training videos on how to think and behave and to accept their way and political views. \r\n\r\nOne Brainwashing video I watched wants you to be paranoid about your colleagues, if they come to work in a new car and you feel their salary doesn't reflect that they should have a new car you're to report it, if they say they're depressed, you're to report it, if they say anything against management you should report it etc, you would have to see this material to believe it. \r\n\r\nThey're big into Diversity making you feel if you're white and a Native and male you're not important.\r\n\r\nOn site security is a complete joke, airport like check points all over the place, empty pockets, take off your belt, take off your shoes, security are even minions carrying out orders from management and they're not even Microsoft staff. This creates an illusion that data bearing devices can't be taken out of server rooms and just adds to the stress because they don't need to be there causing extra stress.\r\n\r\nAccess to parts for techs is a complete joke, this site is massive and you might have to walk 2 Km for simple things like hard drives in the p1ssing rain at 3am because the site is made up of many separate buildings and you have to drive around or walk around it's a lot of hassle, getting in and out through security with parts through security portals, basically the whole job is endless hassle, if they can make the job more inconvenient they will. They won't stock each building with the needed parts only some basic parts, you spend so much time walking around a massive site which adds to the burn out meanwhile the clock is ticking and you got to do so many tickets which half your shift goes looking for parts or walking. No shelter between buildings in Irish Weather ? absolute joke. \r\n\r\nThey have what they call a monthly Goal which involves paying employees to find fault in other employees such as not wearing of high vis vest, maybe someone was seen driving a little faster on site than they should, so you have your own colleagues walking around waiting and hiding around corners to see if you do something, once a month then when management review the monthly Goal one Employee is awarded 100 Euro's for ratting out another colleague, basically they want normal non management staff doing the job for managers. \r\n\r\nMy advice is never to waste your time applying for Microsoft Data Centre in Grangecastle Dublin. It's toxic and they'll burn you out and toss you out like dirt, the novelty of working for Microsoft wears out very quickly."}, {"review_title": "Work life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "26 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Abundant resources, talented engineers, intelligent managers", "cons": "Low pay, move slowly sometimes"}], [{"review_title": "Best Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Principal Software Engineer Manager in Fulton, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Cares about employees and customers", "cons": "There are high expectations for performance"}, {"review_title": "Fantastic place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "13 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Solution Architect in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Scale of opportunity is immense", "cons": "Need to build network in order to develop career opportunities"}, {"review_title": "bad", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Data Analyst in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "very good team and experienced management.", "cons": "long hours and no work life balance."}, {"review_title": "Great place to retire", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer II in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Comfortable life\r\nWork life balance\r\nGood culture", "cons": "Underpaid software developers\r\nSome managers sucks"}, {"review_title": "company review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Business Analytics Specialist in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture and very rewarding", "cons": "not observed at the moment"}, {"review_title": "Excellent place to work with few drawbacks.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Customer Engineer in Vienna, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Highly diverse and friendly environment.", "cons": "Slow promotion rate, due to high visibility information may be vetted through multiple layers for minute details before being authorized sharing with customers."}, {"review_title": "Great company perks and organisational mission", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Customer Success Account Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Company benefits, flexible working arrangements, working with some really smart people", "cons": "May be a little tricky to navigate internally for a new role/payrise.
