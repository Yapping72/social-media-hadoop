They have a free hand and misuse there powers regularly with no checks at all in place. All sorts of bias in place - regional, caste, language, diversity just to name a few.\r\n2. Performance reviews have nothing to do with performance, they are only about having more managers on your side in the calibration and supporting lies they can tell. The Microsoft performance framework isn't bad in itself, with all companies having some sort of a curve. It's the local misuse which is disgusting.\r\n3.

Limited career growth opportunities within and external due to support tag. Internal Job openings are opened later, people to be hired identified first.

With its stack ranking system it aggressively pitted its own people against each other and wholly sacrificed any software company's most critical asset - cooperation.  Amazingly, in their greed to squeeze out more productivity, senior management failed to predict that this would happen. This is supposedly a company of exceptionally bright people, and yet management could not predict something as obvious as that?  Along with cooperation, they lost morale, enthusiasm, innovation and team spirit.  Working for Microsoft is like being in the Mafia, where every team and every individual is looking to take each other out.  This is a verbatim quote from my former manager: \"When you talk to someone from {Team X}, smile, but hold a knife behind your back\".  Those two teams, which needed to work closely together to achieve any modicum of success, were locked in an epic WAR which was dysfunctional, ultimately laughable, and most of all *typical* at Microsoft.  Neither side shared an ounce of information about their system, critically needed for the other side to integrate their software into, and the result was an execution failure as absolute as the disregard for the final product that each contributor shared.  Like a Big Brother-style reality TV series, Microsoft brings out the worst in people, and not surprisingly, in the software they need to produce as a team.  Also, do not think that you will be able to innovate at Microsoft.  They talk (read: lie) a big game about innovation, but the fate of new ideas is that they take a long (several years), winding and  highly political campaign path and ultimately always end in the trash bin.  Unless, of course, Google releases the same idea in the meantime, then there might be a chance.  Why?  Because Microsoft does not innovate.  It never has.  Its MO is \"embrace and extend\".  Wait for others to invent, copy the successful inventions with more resources, and try to steal those inventions away from others.  The other great failure of this company was not to recognize that that model could only have success in the slow-moving 20th century.  I remember being brought into an all-hands meeting where it was explained to us that we need not worry about Google's acquisition of YouTube.  Now that we've seen its success, we were told that Microsoft was going to come into the market second and trounce the competition, as it always does, with its new product \"MSN Soapbox\".  Yea, OK.  Has anyone ever heard of that?  If you work at Microsoft, you will be told that they want you to innovate, but it is literally only an internal propaganda campaign.

The best thing to do about it is just accept it and do your work and not take anything personally.  Don't get starry eyed about maybe going fulltime there, you will find at least a dozen contractors who have been going in and out for years and never gone fulltime (and many of them deserve it).  Instead of hiring in, lots of jobs are being outsourced overseas.  When your contract year is up, just take your 100 days off and hope you'll have work when your break is over.  By the way, your \"break\" means unemployment, which means filing at the unemployment office and applying for jobs every week.  This lifestyle as a contract will be forced upon you.\r\n\r\nLots of closed door meetings won't include you. You won't have any say on what level you work on, if you're moved to another team, and won't be involved in finding solutions.  Even if you don't have any say in the matter as a junior, there's a lot that can be learned simply by being a part of meetings.\r\n\r\nYou'll be forced to use a contract vendor and they take a huge cut of your salary.  There is no apply directly at Turn10 (this seems to be the Microsoft standard).  You will end up working a ton of overtime into the evenings and weekends before deadlines.  Don't be surprised if your lead gets to go home at a decent hour to have dinner because they have \"family\".  You won't be given the same courtesy if you wish to stay valuable, whether or not you have a family of your own.  If it's the holidays and you are forced to take time off due to studio closures, hope you saved up enough money so you don't take a big hit on your paycheck. Many contracts feel forced to work surrounding weekends so they can get a decent few days off for vacation.  Any overtime hours must be pre-approved.  Your lead sometimes will try to give you too much work for a 40 hour workweek and you'll be forced to work some unpaid hours to keep up with their demands or have to admit that this is more than 40 hours which makes you \"slow\" (work smart, not hard.  But also recognize when the deadlines aren't feasible).\r\n\r\nDue to the realism of the games, everything will be made off of strict supply of reference.  This can be cool, but if you are an artist that likes to create orcs and dragons etc from an artistic vision rather than a realistic one, this job will be just that - a job. Don't get your hopes up about making anything for your portfolio either, all the cool stuff will most likely be outsourced. Not to mention there's so much overlap in the levels that nothing will really be your own to claim.  Don't be surprised if someone takes the bulk of your work like a model, applies a texture that Tech Art made, and plops it in their portfolio claiming it as their own.\r\n\r\nIf you're not really interested in racecars or motorsports in general, pretend that you do. Learn how to act excited even when you're really not to better fit in with the studio.  Don't bring up any interests you have that will make you seem weird or not part of the team.  See if you can get an invitation to \"Guys Night\" on Tuesdays to get beer with your male-only coworkers (yes, this was a thing).  Never mind the fact that most of the studio is male and that this is excluding the minority.\r\n\r\nUpper management doesn't care about you personally.  They care if you get stuff done on time and done well so don't get involved and thinking you're making friends with anyone (it's best to just accept this early on in order to function).  Fulltime employees are too busy watching out for themselves within the Microsoft foodchain and don't care to mingle with contracts much.\r\n\r\nPeople do get sabotaged in to losing their jobs here.  Some leads will hold you back from allowing you to doing your job with conflicting and false instructions, impossible deadlines (not just difficult ones, impossible), create bugs and shift the blame to the contract etc.  Upper management, HR, whoever, they don't want to hear about it or deal with it if you're contract.  If the lead says you won't jump high enough, you're out no matter how much evidence you have of the lead being inadequate.\r\n   \r\nI've never been happier to end a contract.  Out of the few jobs I've had in the game industry this was the worst of the lot.  I would not recommend this to any one planning on going in as contract unless they really need the work.  If you end up at Turn10 as contract never stop looking for other work in the industry.  Don't commit to a job that will never commit to you."}], [{"review_title": "Eh... it's a job", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jan 2015", "job_title": "Program Manager in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Overall the benefits are superior to any I have seen.

Face time is also important as it is a popularity contest more than it is about talent or getting real work done. Those that spend the most time on their personal campaigns are those that move up the fastest while the real work is carried on that backs of those with real talent that are usually hidden away in a closet somewhere and if they try to come out or get credit for the work they've done, management and HR have all kinds of interesting excuses as to why that can't happen and it usually falls to words like \"Perception, Lack of Communication Abilities, Don't understand the culture' and on and on.\" These are canned excuses usually used for the population of new people that come in and this becomes recurring feedback to this group for about a five year period until they get tired and leave. \r\n\r\nThis is a brilliant strategy for the old guard as they never have to change anything and simply collect the rewards from the work of others.

Given that, there are thousands of people every day spinning and grinding their wheels on the path to nowhere. \r\n\r\nOf 4 Fortune five hundred companies I have worked at in my career, I experenced the worst case of poor business ethics, lack of accountability, to some degree criminal behavior and or intent that HR refuses to deal with as instead they are hunting down the \"communication and perception\" issues launched by countless old guard managers to hold people down. THree times I brought forward to my GM's ehtical issues and their response were the same which were \"were I you I would drop this line of conversation and just get along.\" This spanned from the Quality Department to the Finance Department. HR protected the GM's so ultimately I left the company as I did not want to be engaged in Enron Type practices. \r\n\r\nTurnover of new employees is really high and HR does not care.

The health insurance in the worst in the industry from what used to be the best.  Salary is decent", "cons": "Health Insurance:  This benefit went from having zero premiums, zero co-pay and zero deductible to having a $3700 deductible for a family plan and then after paying 20%.  Then to make matters worst they have added a very complicated and administrative intensive HSA to manage all of this.  Your wife will not have access as it is tied to your corp account so you will have to manage it if you are used to your wife managing these types of things\r\n\r\nExpectations:  The unspoken expectation is that you change jobs every 3 years or you are viewed as being dead weight.   It is exhausting.  So if you find a job you love and you are really really good at, you simply have to leave.  Could this be the reasons our products keep getting worse?  Because the people who know them have to leave whether they want to or not?\r\n\r\nStack Ranking:  Do not believe the hype.  This still exists.  They just call it something else and it is more secretive\r\n\r\nReview System:  Instead of 2 reviews per year there are a minimum of 4  But they are called Connects now.  You only get compensation for one. So they made something that was already a hassle and made it a double hassle.  Everything you do has to have an immediate business impact.  So if you have a long term strategy or even short term, say a year, nothing you do towards achieving that goal counts because it does not have immediate \"business impact\".   This all started under Satya\r\n\r\nMiddle Managers:  When Satya came onboard there was all this talk of getting rid of layers of middle management so the real ideas could get to the people who needed to hear them.  This never happened.  Every layoff or RIF, Middle Mgrs. were not impacted and well known technical resources were let go.  This is a  company that values non-technical business school managers more than technical people.  Very different than when I started and the reverse was true\r\n\r\nPromotions:   You do not get promoted to a new job.  You only get promoted within your current job.  Being promoted is actually a negative within MS.  For example,  If your job level ranges from 50-52 (fictitious levels).   Say you got promoted mid year from a 50 to a 51.  You think great I am doing a good job! Then come review time you get a mediocre review.  Why you ask?  I am doing the same work I was before, same job.  Management will tell you that now you are being reviewed and compared against others at level 51 so more is expected of you.  Promotions can be used as a way to phase you out.  If they want you gone they can promote you to level 52 so now you either have to transfer or end up with poor reviews at the higher level.  I have known people who moved to jobs at a lower level so they had room to grow.    Most people don't want to reach the dreaded level 63 or 64 I think which is where ALOT more is expected of you.  \r\n\r\nOutside Redmond:  If you do not live in Redmond there are very few opportunities.  Remember the move every 3 years, Do the math\r\n\r\nWork Life Balance:  This does not exist.  You will be expected to work/check email on vacations, holidays etc.   And respond.   I will say that they are flexible about things like leaving early to go to a parent/teacher meeting and things like that.  But you will work 60+ hours per week and be connected to email 24/7.  They do lots of lip service about how this will change but in the 10 plus years I have worked year it has not.  The trick is to take the popular vacations Christmas, July 4th, then everyone else is on vacation so you might not be bothered\r\n\r\nCompany/Product Info:  If you think you will have access to new products, think again.  You will have access when the public does.  You will find out info when the public does. External customers such as TAP will know before you do.  Mary Jo Foley will know before you do.  This applies to internal changes in upper management.  A memo goes out to the press the same time you receive it.  There is no level of trust.  There is also no internal system to share your ideas for product improvement.  There sort of is, but it really goes into a black hole\r\n\r\nEmail Alias Nitemare:   Want to talk to a real person about a problem you are having with an internal tool?  Good luck.  You will have to send email to an alias and they will respond within 48 hours.   Call the Help Desk?  Our Help Desk (the majority) is in India in case you are wondering.  Want to get a question answered about Benefits?  Again send email to an alias and wait 48 hours.  \r\n\r\nCost Center:  Do not work for a cost center.  Make sure you work for a Product Team or revenue generating team.  If you work in a Cost Center they are always nickel and diming and it gets worse every year.  Work for a Product Team, especially one that is profitable and the champagne and caviar are flowing.  I could not believe the difference.  \r\n\r\nThere are too many temps or contingent staff.  In my opinion it is just odd.  And they have important jobs and get treated like full time employees.  Until their contract is up and they have to leave.  \r\n\r\nDiversity:  If you are a white male look elsewhere.  This company is all about hiring females and non-white employees for the sake of diversity.  Ironically there are very few African Americans here but people of other ethnicities \r\n\r\nChange for the sake of change:  Each fiscal year the manager's come out with their plans.  Everyone throws their all into it, then come June it does not matter because the fiscal year starts July 1st and everything changes.  Even if managers were on the right course they MUST change for the mere sake of change or they look like dead weight.

Also they take out their career related frustrations on their sub-ordinates. A manager's word is final in a review process and there is no way you can contest it.\r\n\r\nEverything is top down and there is zero scope for bottom up innovation. I was absolutely amazed when I took some new ideas to my development manager and he said he was too old to connect with such latest ideas connecting new technologies in the market. I never went to him with another idea and resigned from my job. \r\n\r\nAll this internal churn is definitely showing up with lackluster releases (read win 8) and failed product lines (tablets, phones).
