Work pressure is cutthroat due to never ending waves of tickets\r\n2.Even to login 30 mins late/ break you wil have to drop a mail to the team saying coming late or going out of office.And it is expected you follow this always.\r\n3. Oncall and shift rotations will wreak a havoc on your body. Weekends will be a thing of past. During oncall you are expected to be available 4 hours extra. No extra pay for that. And weekend on call work will only give you a compoff and nothing else guys!! its ridiculous but true. You get oncall rota once in 2 months or so. DUring that time you work for 12 hours x 7 Days. Icing on that cake is : You get compoff only and only if you get a call on weekend. So no body cares if you stayed back at home to be readily available for work. One more icing on the cake: No broadband charges get reimbursed for login from home. You are expected to go to office and work. \r\n4.

Microsoft seems to be continuously innovating their tech as of late, which is helpful to sellers.", "cons": "Microsoft\u2019s inside sales org in Irving, TX is called Digital Sales within Microsoft\u2019s Small, Medium & Corporate business segment. \r\nWhen I joined Microsoft, I expected a world class and extremely formalized training program since the company was so large and talks about digital transformation with their customers. Microsoft was the worst and most impersonal onboarding I\u2019ve ever had. They had you do a quick 2 hour meeting with an HR rep, and from there, you\u2019re released to your manager. On day 1, I had boxes of equipment at my desk and was left to unpack and set up all my equipment myself. No one helped me get up and running to ensure I had a successful first day in role. \r\nOutside of the standard education videos, which are all more Microsoft and product focused, there was no formalized training to set external hires up for success within Microsoft digital sales. \r\nIt surprised me that for a tech company, the sales tools available are very archaic and systems do not talk to one another. For example, I spent the first 2-3 weeks of my job entering Help Desk tickets with India just to wait on various system access and tools needed to perform my job. This added to what\u2019s already a stressful time starting a new job. Dynamics is a very antiquated CRM tool (basically an electronic filing cabinet) & was cumbersome to maintain accurate sales records in the tool. \r\nManagement within the org was highly political and would impose constantly shifting priorities that worked well for those in leadership to meet their scorecard metrics by creating business rules that forced reps to sell certain products for a management scorecard and jump through countless internal approval hoops if the product was not included in a deal. This led to many reps selling through discounting versus solution selling - setting a bad precedent for future deals. \r\nThere was also a shift in how the specialists teams interact with the digital Account Executives. Some of the specialists used to be AEs and work as field-based resources, while other AEs have 100% inside-based specialists supporting their accounts. Seems like eventually Microsoft will pivot to eliminating either one group of resources or the other in the future. As a result, mandates come down for the AEs to upskill by taking various certification exams to achieve deeper proficiency in the workloads. This is fine, but it makes you wonder if the goal is eventually to try and eliminate some of the specialists. Often, it felt like they were trying to pile as much on the AE as possible when the AE role was explained to me as a generalist sales role. \r\nMany of the managers within digital sales are extremely duplicitous and political, which created a hostile work environment. Policies would be implemented very haphazardly without the proper training and context for the AE community to fully understand the new policies and adhere to them. \r\nSince it\u2019s Microsoft, there are also a TON of resources (usually contractors) reaching out internally asking you to intro them to your customers or bothering you constantly to let them engage in your accounts. The issue is many of these resources are also inconsistent and not showing value, so you are having to filter through a ton of internal noise and requests for introductions on top of your daily work. \r\nThe majority of the folks there seemed to be hanging on from when Microsoft first opened this sales org due to the relatively high pay for inside sales; however, many of these employees lack the basic skills and Microsoft knowledge to effectively do their job and take care of their customers - they are just there riding the wave. \r\nI\u2019d advise against the Digital Sales AE role and Specialist roles in Las Colinas unless you\u2019re have worked heavily in the Microsoft ecosystem and come to the role with that background and knowledge of what you are getting into. If you come from another software company, you will likely not get the enablement your need to effectively navigate the complexities of Microsoft and management\u2019s constantly shifting priorities."}, {"review_title": "A great place to work if you love writing software", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 May 2009", "job_title": "Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The office environment was great.

He is not a person who tells me what to do.  But he is a person who tells me do what I think is the right thing to do, and if along the way I encounter problems or become frustrated, my manager is there to give me supports, both technically and mentally.\r\n- The work processes at Microsoft are highly structured and very well thought.  Schedules are planned very far ahead in great details that the product can be released on time with a strict quality bar.  The processes and the logistics of the processes are communicated really well to the employees to websites, wikis, and shared documents that are easily accessible.\r\n- There are tons of communication going on in the company.  Each of us has instant messaging client on our machine (Office Communicator) and we chat with each other on daily basis.  We also send emails like crazy, which is much better than not knowing what others are doing.\r\n- The salary is well beyond the average salary in regular tech companies.  The salary for an intern is also well beyond my expectation.\r\n- Managers are required to give assessment of performance of the employees.  In turn, employees are supposed to give assessment of performance of the manager.  This creates a positive feedback loop in the company, and everyone learns from each other.  We also review each other's code and each other's design document, in order to help each other improve.\r\n- We have no work hours.  We only need to get done with our work, and that's it.  It's up to us whether we want to work 9am-5pm, 11am-7pm, 7am-3pm, or working from home, etc.  Things just have to get done.\r\n- We get tons of benefits and free sodas.\r\n- The diversity in Microsoft is amazing.

And the resources you have available to you are pretty unbeatable (funding, etc).", "cons": "Microsoft suffers from a few systemic problems that make it an increasingly miserable place to work.  \r\n\r\nFirst, people management is an under-appreciated discipline at Microsoft.  Instead of promoting employees who are truly interested in and have a talent for management, the company simply promotes the smartest, most accomplished individual contributors into leadership positions.  This creates an environment where managers spend much of their time continuing to work as individual contributors (where there natural talents lie), and neglect the critical tasks of managing and leading their teams.\r\n\r\nSecond, Microsoft has always prided itself on hiring the \"best and the brightest.\"  This, unfortunately, has been taken to an extreme.  The company has a weakness for people who are undoubtedly smart, but often socially inept and acutely uncollaborative.  Having worked in both engineering and marketing organizations, it's a problem that spans multiple disciplines at the company.  This can make it a very frustrating place to work.  Meetings get mired in arguments over esoteric details instead of focusing on the \"big picture\", decisions get postponed or constantly revisited because someone is always uncovering new information that needs to be analyzed to the nth degree, and innovation grinds to a crawl amid people more interested in proving that they're smarter than the guy next to them, instead of working together toward a common goal.  As these \"best and brightest\" inevitably get promoted, these problems are only exacerbated at more senior levels of the company.\r\n\r\nFinally, the company is hypocritical in its approach to managing attrition.  On one hand, Microsoft is ruthless in how it manages \"middle of the road\" performers.  People who are good at what they do and enjoy their work, but  who aren't interested in climbing the corporate ladder, are often ranked in the \"bottom 10%\" of the company during annual review.  This sends the wrong message to solid performers, and severely hurts their chances of finding other positions within the company.  On the other hand, human resources policies and corporate fears of litigation make it nearly impossible to fire people who truly are under-performers.

Especially Main Campus. There is nothing else that really compares or even comes close to the experience. The diversity of people (be it cultures, age groups, backgrounds, genders, education) is amazing. Even the products that Microsoft creates is diverse. Compare that with Google or Facebook who only make advertising revenue.", "cons": "Your experience will vary between teams, but one thing that was consistent (for me, at least) is that most of my time was spent focusing on politics and processes. Though I had the opportunity to work on some popular products, the only way I could ever get my work done (according to expectations) is if I stayed late in the day (most of the time was spent in meetings, dealing with build processes, iterating specs with the team, answering literally hundreds of e-mails a day, helping test team troubleshoot issues) -- unfortunately, a lot of this does not really get accounted in your workload, and in those cases where it does, it's almost impossible to correctly estimate how long those things will take, since it relies on your entire team to work 100% efficiently. I believe work/life balance is actually possible here, but it's only at the expense of getting a positive review. Accountability is important, but most of the time, it felt like I was taking the blame (or being punished for) someone else's poor performance on the team. At the same time, you don't want to point fingers, because it makes you look equally bad. Really the only time I was happy was when I was working late to make everything seem like it was on schedule, or I was on a team with no slackers. Sometimes people would not hold up their end of the workload (say if they were more junior people in their role) and management would expect you to help them do their job, but would not properly account for this in the estimates.\r\n\r\nOver time I eventually learned to manage these things better with politics. Yes, people who have worked in corporations already are familiar with this problem, but at Microsoft, the politics are significantly magnified. People are super smart here and are always trying to make their job easier and take advantage of people who are not as politically savvy. Therein lies the true problem. I eventually left Microsoft, since it felt like most of my time (almost 70%) was spent politicking and handling processes. Coupled with a decrease quality in the products (the gradual results of their work environment) and a lot of other, good people leaving the company. Microsoft seemed to be going downhill.\r\n\r\nThough Enterprise and Azure have really taken off recently, I don't think it will be enough to compensate for the decline of Windows revenue in the end. Surface was an unfortunate flop, and Windows Phone + Bing are sucking money from the company. Xbox 360 was doing great when I left, but now even Xbox One is looking like a poor performer, which is really concerning for the company as a whole, when you combine these things together. Office and Azure are really the only areas left that see significant potential and though Office 365 has showed promise, its revenue is really not enough to make up for the loss in Office desktop sales that are surely to come with the decline of Windows desktops.\r\n\r\nSo please be careful. It's no surprise they had layoffs recently. Despite most of them being in the Nokia division (because of the Nokia merger) still a considerable chunk of few people in Redmond (even top performers) were simply laid off because of the group they happened to be in. They were forced to leave or re-interview for a new positions in the company (which really does not work in your favor when many others are also interviewing due to of the lay offs). A similar approach was used in 2009. It was devastating to morale. Coupled with the \"layoffs continuing to happen over the course of the year\" really would not recommend anybody apply to Microsoft at least until late 2015. \r\n\r\nThe company is undergoing significant changes though to make it self \"more efficient.\" But it's too soon to tell what that really means. Some people suspect that this will be the people who exercised their work/life balance, while at the same time, they will like increase the number of foreign workers who are willing to work the really crazy hours.\r\n\r\nNone of this is encouraging. Luckily, these days there are much better place to work and have a good life balance. \r\n\r\nSo now is definitely *NOT* the time to consider Microsoft. Look elsewhere and maybe reconsider in late 2015 is my humble recommendation."}, {"review_title": "Hard work, ownership, and bias for action are usually well rewarded.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "2 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Technical Writer in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you are delivering on a project that has a measurable impact on the bottom line you will typically be recognized and rewarded for your contribution.\r\nMany opportunities for success.", "cons": "Lately politics have become a hindrance, teams often have drastically different resouce allocation.

There is a positive buzz internally, the industry and investors are responding positively. Our stock prices have shot up. We are truly embracing change and newer/innovative products (Hololens, Surface Book etc.) are being released. \r\n* Under Satya's leadership and new review model, Employees are measured on business impact (reduces unnecessary politics and brown-nosing, and focus is on impact/results), how they leverage the work of others and build on top of others work (reduces duplication of work across teams/organizations, and increases collaboration), and how employees have helped others to be successful (focus changes from individual success to team success).\r\n* Microsoft has done away with the older performance review system (1 - Outstanding ... all the way to 5 - Very poor/no impact). This was a forced curve, meaning people managers had to find employees to fit in each category leading to some unfavorable behavior and culture. The newer model no longer rates employees on the 1-5 scale, and there is no \"calibration\" exercise (forced curve). However, as a manager one still has to 'differentiate' employees based on impact. \r\n* Satya meets with his directs and product group leaders/engineering leaders weekly/several times a month. He also has frequent employee all-hands where he talks to employees, and everyone in the company has a chance to ask him questions directly.

Our competitors often make a huge deal of features and functionalities that Microsoft products have had in years. Even as a FTE and 10+ years at the company (true blue Microsoftie), I often come across things in our products I didn't know existed. We can do better in that area. To give credit where due though, under the leadership of our (relatively) new EVP Marketing - Chris Capossella, there are truly impactful, meaningful and inspiring advertisements, and marketing strategies that reflect the power and potential of Microsoft products, better than how we have done in the past.\r\n* While Benefits are better than many other companies, it used to be better a few years ago. Medical was \"free\" and Microsoft took care of all the medical expenses. With the changes a few years ago, preventive care is 'free' but employees have a co-pay for all other medical expenses.\r\n* Compared to similar tech companies like Facebook and Google, we don't have \"Free Food\" although \"Free Soda/Juices\" are available in every building.\r\n* Sometimes things may not seem very transparent across management layers and working across teams may sometimes seem complicated. But with the newer One Microsoft philosophy and way of working under Satya's leadership, there is way less politics and way more collaboration, and partnership. \r\n* Moving across organizations is relatively challenging (eg. moving from IT to Engineering/Product Group); also cross-org movement after a certain level (Level 65) is challenging.

And the remarkably inconsistent leadership has left this otherwise great company rudderless against competition, eager to try broad new initiatives - most with mixed or lackluster results.

Disagreements or direct confrontation is frowned upon, while 'back channel' negotiations and positioning drive influence.   If you prefer a culutre that is far more direct and vocal, Microsoft may not be a great environment or experience for you. \r\nPromotions and advancement can be very slow unless you have an acceptable 'alpha dog' personality and or othereise are a strong contributor and belong to high profile demographic groups.  If you don't fit these categories, make sure you get a level and salary you will be happy with when you start for at least two years or more as you will very likely not be considered for promotions until your second or third review (unless you stand out like a rock star).  Smaller companies reward and promote much quicker, so if you are used to or expect that, you may be disappointed.\r\nWhile Microsoft makes much of its merit-based promotions/rewards system, its really difficult to believe it.  This is the problem of any large company where promotion and reward decisions are made further and further up the org hierarchy; so its just really difficult for all but the most signifciant (or narcisitic!) to get noticed.  This means that employees who consistently deliver good work but don't generate a lot of awareness can often be overlooked.\r\nThe lack of transparency around 'level's is one of the problems IMO:  Promotions are secretive and not acknowledged in most groups, which is kind of weird and doesn't lead to a lot of trust in a system if management is not willing to acknowledge who gets promoted and who does not.\r\nThe work you do may be exciting, but there is a 12 to 18 month cycle where the project/product you are working on will go from high profile to mundane or (as seen recently) a target for personnel reductions.  This leads to one of the solutions and problems at Microsoft in that you are going to have to change internal jobs frequently to stay relevant (e.g. 18 months to 2 years).  There is little value placed on consistent results generation; Microsoft wants rock stars who will generate internal enthusiasm and garner resources and rewards, which leads to a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy (until they ultimately flame out, see Xbox One launch!)."}, {"review_title": "Middle management at Microsoft", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "4 Jan 2015", "job_title": "Principal Program Manager Lead in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Well paying, highly influencial position where direct control over features and schedules is in your hands.

Sure, most places have it, but my last position was the first time I've seen retributive actions taken by senior management to get rid of less-than-supportive team members (not me).\r\n\r\n* Cronyism: I've seen my teammates not get funding for plane travel from his hometown to campus (Redmond) once every 3-6 months and thus traveled via bus. Meanwhile friends of senior management fly home weekly to California. Friends and the \"good ol' boys\" are more important than the business or fairness. Even while I was getting laid off, certain \"good ol' boys\" were still hiring their friends from outside Microsoft.\r\n\r\n* Sexism: Our group's leadership were entirely comprised of Indian males. Unfortunately India has a prevalent sexist culture in many places, and this was transferred to our group. I have Indian friends (male and female) who agree with me, so please don't accuse me of being racist. The women in our group were frequently marginalized and one quit after being told to \"shut up and be quiet\" during a meeting. Not wishing to cause waves none of them wanted the bother and hassle of reporting it to HR so they just left.\r\n\r\n* Lack of support for remote folks. It's the 21st Century and some entire orgs have a \"no remote\" policy."}, {"review_title": "Software Engineer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Nov 2016", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Excellent Benefits\r\n-Opportunities to learn from some of the best engineers in the world\r\n-Job security (for the most part)\r\n-Interesting technical challenges\r\n-If you get sick of your team, you can move around", "cons": "Not too many.

There is a vast wealth of material on hand for research to get you started on new projects quicker, pointed in the right direction, or help you out of a jam.\r\n - Good corporate values", "cons": "- If you are in a group that is in a cost center, and particularly if costs are being cut, then the only way you can grow is often for someone else to shrink.  This has incented poor behavior in some places.  \r\n - There is no end to work, that is making your project and yourself better.  Balance that with your management. You need to balance work/life or it can get out of control.  \r\n- it is not a meritocracy, you will need to network and sponsors to protect and promote your career just as much as doing good work.  \r\n- rewards are very tied to making your direct management chain better.

They only listen to their loudest reports. This management \"culture\" seems to be a result of Microsoft's stock early, quick ascent until 2000. Managers didn't see the need to nurture and build their reports since many Softies retired after 4-5 years. Why bother building people when you knew they were short term anyway? After year 2000 people getting rich at MS dropped significantly but the management culture did not change and appeared oblivious their old idea of being lazy and telling their reports to own their own careers was not healthy for the company nor their reports. Perhaps things are finally changing with the new review structure but unfortunately those managers who thrived in the old system are still the gatekeepers to making the new system work. Good luck.  \n- At least in the groups I was part of, the engineers who get hired are consistently from a narrower and narrower band of personality types which restricts diversity of thought and action. I guess it makes it easier this way to plug and play engineers when the wind changes and a VP or director is replaced and they want to reorg. \n- Dev and test merging into one. I'm a dev and I always respected and appreciated those in the test groups who had a passion for testing and breaking things. Their passion wasn't necessarily to design and build the software. Now, everyone gets thrown into the same soup and guess what, the former SDETs are usually handed a lot of the test work but now, they won't rank as high as the former SDEs since many DEV managers still value product  code output over testing. Many outside companies are happy to grab the disgruntled former SDETs so it's a boon for those companies. Unless this changes, it will be easy to predict, over time, Microsoft software quality will drop. \n- Work life balance. It's getting worse. I talk with my old friends still at Microsoft and they continue to be more and more warn out with increasing loads being placed on them. Some are dev managers and even though the products they work on, especially cloud, are getting many more users, their teams are not allowed to grow. In fact one friend who has had a number a folks leave over the past few years because of lack of work life balance, has not been allowed to hire new people in to at least backfill those who have left. Yes, the team has to get more efficient but largely by making the rest work harder and harder.

We are a part of them. We got carried away by the brand name and the pay that they offered. One of the pro's of being a MACH is you will be treated like royalty in GTSC for the initial few months. The administration who take care of MACH are EXELLENT. But once you get pushed to different teams and you come under different administration your life is going to change. However, there are one/two teams which have good administration but the chances of getting into those teams are very rare. Even if you do get into those teams, the fact is this job does not deserve engineers. It requires the skillset of a person who can sell solutions to customers.\r\n\r\nThey say that GTSC is not a call center but it is run by the authorities like a call center. We are from one of the topmost colleges in India and we came in to this role thinking it will be a journey of a lifetime. Yes it has become an unforgettaale journey for all of us.\r\n  \r\nThis company is full of politics and biased managers ,ego filled and lazy engineers on floor and arrogant technical advisors (However, there might be exceptions). BUT NEVER TAKE THIS AS YOUR FIRST JOB! Choose to be a developer in a startup for a lesser pay, but never take up this job! Tech support is a kind of job which requires capability of selling solutions to the customers. this job is not for people who come from TECH background.\r\n\r\nThis job is considered as a golden opportunity for people who come from call center backgrounds who learn a bit of tech stuff and find their way until Microsoft. this job is not for students who come from campuses, who would have worked hard for four years. also, to mention one of the most important things, you can hardly find people with Engineering background in this company. They just know how to troubleshoot and lack technical knowledge. Talking about the growth here, almost every engineer is sluggish and they will drag you down when you decide to grow fast.   \r\n\r\nLooking at the opportunity outside GTSC once you get here is almost nil. You will be supporting a Microsoft product and you WILL NOT have any other job opportunity. Even if you do, the pay will be  bad and will be unwilling to quit and you will be forced to stay here.\r\n\r\nAlso, the shifts that you will have to work in. You will become an unhealthy person with all sorts of health problems. You will have to sleep at around 8 AM in the morning and get up at 5 PM in the evening and run to the office. Your whole eating habits will change. You will feel very unhealthy. Also, working at night will take a toll on your mental health because you will not be in contact with the world at all, as you will be sleeping in the day and working at night. The only set of faces whom you'll see is your teammates.\r\n\r\nYou will be asked to work over  weekends like Sunday to Saturday or Tuesday to Saturday, which will drift you away from normal life. You will start to forget the feel of Sunday morning, as even if you work from Monday to Friday shift, you wont be able to sleep on Saturday night(as you will be awake all over night for the whole week) and sleep through whole day of Sunday. To add on to the woes of this job, any National holiday is considered as a leave. But in order to stay home that day you will need manager approval for it as only a particular number of people can be on leave for a particular day. Most of the time you will be not be getting it as the old employees are smart enough to block it soon and you will be working even during a national holiday. FOR EXAMPLE: YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK DURING DIWALI/CHRISTMAS or INCLUDING NEW YEAR'S EVE!!\r\n\r\nIf you notice, you can ask hundred people who are currently working and ask them how is the job and everyone gives a good opinion. It's because of the fear of the higher authority like their managers. Do not fall for their words as they will be helplessly hiding the actual truth. \r\n\r\nLast but not the least, there will be a huge chunk of people coming from a particular company( Which is basically a call center and we do not wish to disclose the name of that company), who are mostly not engineers and do not have any tech knowledge. You will feel ashamed to sit alongside people who lack tech knowledge and boss over you. also, to mention most of the people (99% and their might be very few exceptions) have reached Microsoft GTSC not by studying the technology, but by being nice to higher officials. If you are from a reputed college, you will not have the mindset of bowing your head without any reason(unless if required) and you will be indirectly punished by higher authorities for not doing so(In terms of year end reviews). \r\n \r\nMY ADVICE TO ALL CAMPUS HIRES : Take this job up only if you want to spoil your health and career. If you are from one of the best colleges from INDIA, my advice is not to take up this job. We all know how difficult it is to crack a Entrance exam and find ways to topmost colleges.

Product groups, despite the frequent mention of innovation in internal documentation, rarely have the patience for it.  For someone that's worked in truly innovative environments, it may be disappointing to see what marketing will often label \"innovative\" to customers and employees.  We rarely truly interact with customers until after we've built and shipped product Betas--which can take anywhere from six to twenty-four months, depending on the project.  Often, the features customers want are two to four years out from the request if they weren't included in the original product definition.  Microsoft struggles with change from traditional development processes, although some groups are more proactive than others.  Most engineers I know are not domain experts--and being a domain expert, particularly when you are new to the company and there are few to no other domain experts (particularly in management), means it will be hard to be heard unless you have stellar social skills (i.e. influence).  Discpline managers (e.g. Software Engineer Managers) generally wield considerable authority, yet in my experience do not contribute to the discipline beyond process and negotiating contracts with other teams.  Microsoft often talks about passion, but it will be frustrating to see discpline managers that ask you to come in on weekends and stay late, when they aren't rolling up their sleeves themselves.  People are promoted into management too quickly, and many of these promotions seem to be based on friendship circles, so the heirarchy at Microsoft can be frustrating.  Politics are prevalent.  Employees are stack-ranked or \"calibrated\" against their peers (despite claims that this has changed, it has not) to determine yearly compensation and review, and this can adversely affect those that don't fall in line with their manager.  Bullying is common, as is back-stabbing, and there is no effective outlet.  I've seen slews of competent folks leave or be pushed out of teams due to empire building.

People are rewarded for this, regardless of success or failure of the product/feature.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that individual work requirements and deliverables vary so widely that it hardly makes sense to compare them to each other -- it's an apples and oranges exercise.

People are rewarded for this, regardless of success or failure of the product/feature.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that individual work requirements and deliverables vary so widely that it hardly makes sense to compare them to each other -- it's an apples and oranges exercise. Attempting to apply the mythical man-month to creative engineering roles is inherently folly.\r\n\r\nAnother side effect is that there ends up being a huge amount of collaborative and dependency overhead, which limits teams' agility and ability to deliver on short timelines.

The cash-cows of Windows and Office continue to bolster the company financially (i.e. \"nobody ever got fired for buying Microsoft\"), which is a good thing for keeping the company profitable and stable, but it masks the fact that it's a lumbering beast of a company that's finding it increasingly difficult to compete and stay relevant in emerging technology markets."}, {"review_title": "Good pay, good benefits, great work/life, bad everything else", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Sept 2012", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer I in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay is pretty good.

Yes, it is true.  In the recent years, the company has somewhat finally coming into terms with the problem and is trying to shift to a more collaborative environment.  Unfortunately, the successful veterans, many of who are managers of other people or owners of product areas, are failing/do not want to adopt.  Normal human behavior, they try but it is unnatural and revert to the old comfortable (unhelpful) ways, that gave them control and success in the past.  Several of them moved to other companies (e.g. Google) and are known to continue on the bad patterns. The problem is becoming lesser in Microsoft, but still pretty significant. This is not an issue with new hires without past experience; new hires do bring a more open/positive energy. \r\n\r\nLittle life-balance:\r\nThis is something that has consistently been insane and has consistently been the lowest bucket of priorities.  It is an unspoken consequence that people who practice life-balance will not advance, or advance extremely slowly.  The problem is that if you are given a task and take the time to do it, you will be blocking other people who have less life-balance, and so managers rather give you a less impactful task.  Bottom line, a less impactful result means a lower review score.  If you want to advance and/or keep your job, do not count on life-balance, specially if your manager is from the old culture.  As many people over the years have attested, this is often not worth it; missed the time to live with your kids as they grow up, divorces, etc.\r\n\r\nWeak individual contributor roles:\r\nThe company is now more catered to advancing manager roles.  However to become one is very difficult and political.  Individual contributors are now treated more-or-less as well-paid laborers.  Opportunities for innovation are very scarce and very tightly controlled; there are instead huge loads of fairly dull tasks that needs labor.  Most of the time an IC will be on these tasks and will no way get an award for them.  However, a manager having several ICs completing all these tasks will definitely get rewarded.  People have observed again and again how some managers are rewarded almost consequence-free, regardless of the product outcome, attrition level, or less-than-honest influencing.\r\n\r\nVery bad leadership coordination:\r\nManagers do not coordinate with each other very well, even with their own peers.  Often you will find separate teams with overlapping efforts, one manager is trying to out-do the other, instead of trying to align something greater together.  This was more pervasive in the past, lesser of a problem now, but still there (old culture).

It is easy to find great, talented, and professionally experienced mentors.\r\n5. Moving about the company...let me rephrase that...technical breath and deepth are strongly encouraged. If Microsoft went from writing software to being a library or a hospital, it's employees would get right to it and thrive.\r\n6. Great, strong collaboration between all the engineering deciplines. \r\n7. World-wide talent. Microsoft goes to great lengths to recruit arround the world and lobby directly with congress to have certain immigration/visa limitation overruled. \r\n8. Excellent resources for professional developement. Books, e-books, databases, on-site and online classes.\r\n9. There is a group/alias for anything you can imagine...singing, theatre, biking, knitting,,,you name it. It is easy to get connected.\r\n10.

There seems to be a bias between certains teams when it comes to salary and promotion. For example,  two new college hirers started the same month, at Windows Live and Office teams respectively. Each at the same initial level with the same salary. After 3 years, the one in Office may have a greater salary and employment level than the one in Windows Live. Well you may say, the \"successful\" one is more capable, but astonishingly it has more to do with opportunity within the group you're hired into.

I often work 75+ hours a week in order to complete all the works. Not only me but I also hear complaints from colleagues in the same team about the workload. The workload comes in the following ways:\r\n1. Scheduling: the management will try to \"persuade\" you to compress the schedule into what fits their schedule needs, ignoring the true task time costs, and all the uncertain factors that could delay the schedule. Once you sign on that schedule, all factors that drag you down need to be paid from your own pocket -- your personal time. By forcing you to commit to such scheduling, they implicitly put you to work long hours.\r\n2. On-demand tasks: when you are signed on to work on a 1 month long project that needs 8 hours dedicated time each day, the management will try to randomly give instruction to you to take care of some random tasks, which could take 3 hours a day. At the same time they track your progress on the scheduled task.\r\n3. Incidents: you need to take care of incidents, such as cluster down or test reported failures. Which could take 4 hours for each incident. At the time you signed-up to work on a 8 hours-day pre-planned project. \r\n4. You can get promoted only if you work extra time: the management will assign you with all those routine tasks that would already take you 10+ hours a day. For promotion, as they said, you need to do something beyond routine that would impress them. That means you find another project besides your already long hours routine tasks, to get recognized. \r\n5. Code changes everywhere: as the Cloud related project is fast growing, all the components were changing, and your existing code can be broken by other people anytime. Then you need to take care of that. \r\n\r\nBesides the workload, also there is issue in:\r\n1. No core competency developed in SDET job role: even with such long hours daily working time, most things I do are low level: writing straght-forward-logic C# code (like scripts), take care of some config text files, copy-paste test failures' stack traces, start test runs, spend 5 hours to find out a way to hack the dev component to test something they didn't provide interface. I believe I won't be able to find another job after doing things like for 3 more years. \r\n2. The pay scale is definitely not worthy for this workload. I of heard people in Amazon complaining their workload due to nature of online services (fast pace, incidents, etc), but their pay is 30% higher.

The performance review system is a forced curve.  10% of all employees will be graded at the bottom rung and put on \"probation\" or \"corrective measures\".

Promotion velocity: if you don't move up the corporate ladder fast enough, you will soon become unpromotable regardless of how well you perform.\r\n\r\nSecond, technical ability is not valued as much as management ability.

If that old system was still in place, I would have spent a lot of time describing why it's bad.\r\n\r\nSo I guess one positive thing is that they were able to listen to the feedback and make a change.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think it's a great company to work for. Different divisions and teams operate differently and can have different cultures. Where I worked, I think things were pretty typical of most software companies. You work with relatively smart people who enjoy their work and for the most part everyone wants to get good work done. Now, the old review system actually through some wrenches into this attitude, but I still had a positive time at work.\r\n\r\nThe pay is good (it can vary greatly though), and the benefits are also very good. There aren't really any life altering perks that make you love the place though. There is free juice and soda, which probably seemed cool in the 90's, but it greatly pales in comparison to what's offered at places like Twitter and FB. Yeah, it's certainly not something that should be at the top of your benefits list, but still, the workplace feels very basic. I suppose the discount on MS products is a nice perk, but to be honest, it also felt like a burden as you have friends and relatives asking you to buy stuff. It's still a good benefit, but in the cons section, I'll explain something I didn't like about it.\r\n\r\nMost MS buildings are a mess of private offices and meeting rooms. So if you like private offices, then it's a pro (though not everyone gets an office). I had a private office, and there were definitely some benefits to it as compared to an open desk.", "cons": "This is probably highly dependent on your team and division, but I felt I had little real world impact, partially because the higher-level strategy kept changing too often.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, you could work in a private office. It is nice to have your own whiteboard and you can close the door for discussions, etc, but overall, I felt that it was a huge waste of space. The space in my office was used primarily for display little knick-knacks. I would have much rather had the money spent on real estate to go to salary and perks we could have had, such as free food or extensive free snacks and drinks. Also, the offices make MS building seem sterile and outdated. A place of \"business\" rather than colloboration and innovation, and then, of course, there's also the political bs involved in moving, who gets their choice of which offices, do they have windows, are they close to the bathroom or etc.\r\n\r\nMS doesn't have good infrastructure in place for sharing code, ideas, or anything really. Because of MS's disparate businesses, MS can't have a singular vision. That is okay, I guess, but the real problem is how sharing is so antithetical to the culture. They don't allow open discussion within the company. Products are developed in secret. Code bases are rarely shared outside of a division. Engineers have to request access and provide justification to look at code outside of their org.\r\n\r\nYeah, I understand that MS has 100,000 employees and so leaking confidential information anonymously is a real concern. I understand that as a big company, they are targeted for lawsuits and are worried that emails by every employee will be subpeonaed, etc. That said, I think this is a loss for them in the long run. I think what they would gain from being more open and collaboritive internally outweighs the risk of leaks. MS is way too risk averse, even when they think they are being bold.\r\n\r\nToo often, on internal discussion lists, I see that when someone posts something critical of some product that they did not personally work on, some one responds with something like, \"That's easy for you to say. You didn't put the hard work into it. I'm sure they have important reasons for doing this\" etc etc. In other words, criticisms are too often seen as attacks to defend against, rather than failures and feedback to be taken humbly and addressed.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Company Store benefit, it is of course, great to be able to buy stuff at a really nice discount. I also enjoyed being able to get MS published games a day early. That said, I do want to point out that Nintendo lets their employees buy games a week early. They also don't put those obnoxious stickers on the box which ruins the packaging. I absolutely hated this. It's like there's some kind of seperation between you and \"the Company\".

The company is aging and, while many organizations are modernizing their way of building products, others are still trapped in the 90's under leaders (partner-level) who are making too much money to step aside and create growth opportunities for the next generation of leaders.  \r\n\r\nFor folks who have held senior positions elsewhere: Expect to be compensated well, but your prior experience means nothing.  There is very little respect for experience in other companies unless you're a bounce back from Amazon, Facebook, or Google to get a level bump.

There seem to be a large number of retired \u201cMicrosofties\u201d in the area.  With their cashed out options from the 80s and 90s, the home prices went through the roof.  Due to the geography (Lake Washington, Lake Sammamish, hills and mountains), there are fewer places to build homes.  As a result, the demand versus the supply is very large.  Home prices have stayed relatively high even through this past year\u2019s market downturn.

Employees move around often, you can never be sure if you\u2019ll have the workforce the team needs to deliver features for the next version of your product.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tMicrosoft generally follows the market and will hold off on creating a product until it\u2019s clear there is a large demand and a clear business justification.

This is a wonderful business model but at times if feels like you\u2019re creating software for others, and not the software that you\u2019d like to use yourself.

So the varied stereotypes of a \"monopolistic Microsoft\" or \"large company intent on a closed software system\" here, do not necessarily hold true.  You can see that in conversations with customers.  They want us to do well.  They want us to be a strong, viable competitor to the other big players in the online advertising industry.  This is a huge plus when it comes to the willingness of customers to work with us, especially given our big name.  It also manifests in a strong focus and collaboration among the dedicated engineering, business group and sales teams.  It's a pro in the sense that the advertising business needs to be an open ecosystem and that is refreshing if you've never worked here before.\r\n\r\nOne other pro that I'll mention is the fact that there is incredible talent in the strategy teams.

There are certainly a lot of things to be aware of, if you have never worked at Microsoft.\r\n\r\nWhen I joined, I was surprised by a few things about the organization:\r\n\r\n1)  It's true that promotions are hard to come by.  You could go on for years with pretty good annual reviews but still not be promoted for various reasons.  This is incredibly frustrating and had I known this earlier, I would have done more then rather than to learn it after several years.  But I believe it takes a certain type of person.  You need to know how to manage upwards extremely well.  Talk to your manager.  Be firm about what you want and when.  Be incredibly focused on what moves the needle.  And have great impact and influence on others.  It's easy to be distracted on other things.\r\n\r\n2) It takes a long time to get things done.  Because it's such a large organization, great ideas take time to cultivate and turn into solid strategy, priorities, and action items.  There are so many people to get buy-in from.  But if you build the relationships and understand how the system works, you learn to factor that into your daily work and projects.  If you come from an entrepreneurial background and you are used to doing things quickly or on a whim to test out, etc, then I would caution you to think hard about this.  Get used to simple things sometimes taking months to complete.\r\n\r\n3) There are a lot of managers here who don't do a good job of balancing both their individual contributions with their managerial responsibilities.  It's definitely hard because a manager wants their team to perform well but they also want to contribute directly to the organization's success.

Each of the years that I was there, our direct manager would have a meeting with us and would say \"if you have any problems at all, we would appreciate it if you told us in advance of the survey so we can work things out\".  This to me is just purely unethical - You are essentially strong armed into providing responses that are not honest for fear of it coming back to bite you professionally.  Managers seem to be \"graded\" on this so if they have a small group of reports, then it wouldn't be too hard for them to figure out who said what (or they may assume).   \r\n\r\nSpeaking of surveys - they do the same with their customers as well.  This is a big metric within MS and reps have to be very careful as to who they get to fill out their surveys in order to get a good response.  Have literally seen reps blatantly ask for good marks rather than honest ones.  \r\n\r\nPolitical - very political internally.   There are people who have been there for years and are very much an \"inner circle\".    People are some-what click'ish.\r\n\r\nNot really a \"negative\" but just different - Very different sales cycle and unique from most other sales organizations.   July, there is nothing going on, August through ~October is mostly \"sales planning\".   Different in that the specialists are responsible for telling the account managers where the opportunities are within the account managers companies.   This is not a big negative, but I do find it unusual.  You would think that the account manager should know where the opportunities are within their own accounts."}, {"review_title": "Great employer for smart but unambitious family-orientated people who love rain", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "3 Jan 2014", "job_title": "Director in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Overall, a great deal: solid pay, nearly guaranteed annual bonus, stock, opportunity to for recognition.

Increasingly the management of any given division actually knows very little about developing software.\r\n\r\nDespite all claims to the contrary, beyond a certain level, it becomes very difficult to grow your career as a technical individual contributor.  You can either move into management and become useless, or you can spend more and more of your time with political maneuvering and visibility games so that you can continue to get promoted.

Which means you have to have a manager who will fight for your promotion and is under pressure to keep employees at the levels hired, unless they've attracted senior level attention. Be bright, ambitious, and knife your way to the top: it's classic. Of course, the downside is you have to work in that environment.\r\n\r\n The top 10% of the curve can be rewarded well, even lavishly, but performance won't be enough; you need to sail past your peers, so in a really quality group, you're screwed, somebody has to fill the middle or even the bottom of the curve. Microsoft has always been severely hierarchical - teams are for drones to follow orders. \r\n\r\nHaving  90,000 employees makes hierarchies seductively attractive for weak bureaucrats, and Microsoft does believe that excellence can be driven by the top 10%, which, if promotion was meritocracy-driven: maybe. But where smooth-talking politicians are easier to promote, the leadership can be hit and miss. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft, even for the fast-moving superstars, offers no training other than what's gleaned on the job, and given that a majority of top managers have never worked anywhere else and have no other perspective than 'drinking the corporate Kool-Aid', the probability of working for a bozo who is scared stiff and unable to function or promote team members, is, unfortunately, pretty freakin\u2019 high.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft needs an intellectual enema: we have legions of people standing on their thumbs one minute and then racing 14 hour days trying to make things function. We have an obfuscating layer of untrained managers who squirm and hide when bold decisions or true leadership is required. The hierarchy that semi-functioned when Microsoft was small, no longer works. It causes huge inefficiencies and lost shareholder value as the numbers outstrip the ability of hierarchies to offer enlighten direction. As painful as it would be for Microsoft employees, the company needs a IBM-style crisis to force a new look at what businesses it makes sense to pursue, and how to motivate employees to create really noteworthy software. \r\n\r\nMake sure you\u2019re not working for Microsoft when that happens."}, {"review_title": "Overall -- not a bad place to work.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great opportunities to make a difference both for internal as well as external projects.\r\nGreat opportunities to 'dogfood' the latest and greatest products.\r\nOutstanding benefits.", "cons": "Many managers should never have become managers; their ability to help you drive your career was limited at best.\r\nCommunications between groups could be better;  sometimes projects were duplicated or even more!"}, {"review_title": "ok place to work as a first job. pay is low but benefits are good.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Feb 2010", "job_title": " in Bellevue, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "there are nice training. your peers are usually smart. there are some challenging problems to work with. this place is best for college graduates for the first job.", "cons": "the pay is low. vendors usually are paid much higher. advancing is kinda slow for tech company. this is a company that is no longer in growth stage."}, {"review_title": "A good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Incredibly smart fellow employees\r\nA respect for work-life balance\r\nWorld class benefits\r\nProfessional management\r\nCareer mobility\r\nCompany brand well-respected in the marketplace", "cons": "It has become very \"big company\" bureaucratic and political\r\nExtremely corporate headquarters-centric\r\nIf you don't want to live at corporate headquarters (Redmond Washington), it's very hard to have upward career advancement\r\nTotal compensation (without benefits package added) not particularly exciting"}], [{"review_title": "Yeah, I would work there again...", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 May 2010", "job_title": "Solution Manager in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Day to day people that I worked with were fantastic.

Frankly, customer is a concept on a ppt slide. Part of the problem is that all global roles are a) based in Redmond b) rarely leave Redmond c) not directly linked to the field where the work actually happens d) spend their time building playbooks and strategy videos NO ONE actually reads or cares about. \r\n3) Linking words with action: the follow-through is non-existent. You sit in a meeting and the person will say, I will drive that and come back. They rarely do. Its such a large company and globally you are disconnected from the business in many groups so the accountability is not there.\r\n4) Leadership gaps: Leaders tend to be very isolated, at the CVP and GM levels, you engage them through their business managers who filter information to them.   Most leaders also are more focused on making partner than developing their teams, sadly. \r\n5) You have to be in the Enterprise side, the consumer side is a trainwreck, led by people who have no clue what they are doing. Its also not a focus (outside of Office) for Satya. If you are a strong retail person, you will quickly see many serious challenges. \r\n\r\nSatya is driving change and its the right change, but the challenge is that while he has replaced many of the Senior Leaders who didn't buy into his game plan, the next level of management (GM) is still firmly entrenched in the ways of the past so will take a long time to make Microsoft a customer-centric, people-focused, agile organization and by that time, the market will have already moved on."}, {"review_title": "Microsoft Retail Product Advisor", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Nov 2017", "job_title": "Product Advisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The only positive things are the benefits, the co workers, as well as it being slow.", "cons": "After working here for a bit, I thought it would be right to share my opinion on how this job is. Do not be fooled that just because this is Microsoft that you are doing huge things. At the end of the day it is just another retail job. My over arching problem with the job leads to the hours. You are expected to work minimum 20 hours a week which is normal but, when you submit an availability and your managers do not adhere to it, then it becomes a problem. Being a student, time management becomes tougher especially since work is not the main priority. Also, Even when voicing my concern, it does not seem like it is being heard and the managers do not pay much heed to new hires.  I do not understand why part timers can only have 5 hour shifts and are required to work 4 days when it is completely possible to work less days and longer hours especially if those days happen to be the busy days for the store. I write this review in hopes for management to read this and hopefully address my concern. Also another con is that it is fairly high stress. You deal with a plethora of customers and the word \"no\" is never and option. You have to treat customers far above many different places and it's outstanding the lengths one is required to go. I understand that the customer comes first, but the way it is being approached is utterly wrong. To each their own and this is my opinion.
