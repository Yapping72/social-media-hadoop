Work with some of the best talented and visionary people in the world.\r\n5. Brand name, although it's been eroding since last 2 years in domestic hiring market.( it does not stands in front of the FANG competitors and generally does not gives you an advantage )", "cons": "Cons of Microsoft as a whole\r\n- Huge company, so it's easy to be lost. Imposter syndrome is real here.\r\n- MSFT management and LT is known to be slow, political and pathological in the wider industry circle, with poor grasp of what market wants. A lot of innovative steps are axed due to internal politics, only to be picked up competition and made a market success.\r\n\r\nCons of MS-GD\r\n - This is career Literal black hole. You will join 2 levels lower than a college fresher Developer in India, irrespective of your lateral experience. the result is that you will receive stocks up to 5-6 years later than a fresher engineer in iDC.\r\n- Lateral hiring will set you back by 5-6 years in terms of career growth.\r\n- The management here is Pathological and one can find traces of nepotism, narcissistic & predatory behavior in various layers of leadership.\r\n- Your promotion depends not on what kind of work you do or how you have enabled the organization to grow, but how well you mesh with LT/Managers and how you have enabled them to grow in their own silo.\r\n- Your manager who has no visibility into your work is responsible for your appraisal and growth within your local practice. While your peers who have seen - Your work quality have no say. The person responsible for project cannot affect or contribute to your success.\r\n- Success criteria have become a tangled complex web of responsibilities that even your LT will be unable to answer. A consultant is responsible to deliver all the added target endpoints while meeting a 1600+ hours a year of utilization.\r\n- You are responsible for your career growth, consumption metrics, project utilization etc, while also doing the work your manager is supposed to do.\r\n- Your manager will not help you in your career growth. You will be lucky if your manager stays with you for even 10-11 months. Invariably, you will experience a manager change every year and have to deal with the headache of dealing with new style, expectations and forced suggestions while handling your daily stress of work.\r\n- Burnout and mental distress is real here. LT will advertise mental health as important, but you will be reprimanded for taking leaves or timeout. In fact, covid crisis has demonstrated where managers have asked people to continue work even after tragic events in their life.\r\n- WLB is non-existent here. You are responsible for your WLB while ensuring delivery targets. Every project you go in will be understaffed, under budget and either in yellow or red state. You will work on multiple projects which will require you to pull 12+ hours a day, while the internal system will discourage you to log in more than 8 hours a day.\r\n- As an MS-GD associate, expect subtle racism from your time-zone peers. Lateral moving to another timezone or functional group is a non-zero impossibility chance due to inherent bias and the image of \"Cheap Labor\" created by existing LT.\r\n- Do not expect any help from your colleagues. The culture of backstabbing is real and encouraged. Stack ranking may be gone on paper but exists on ground.\r\n- The culture on ground is one of the worse seen among the majority of players in this circle. MS-GD culture is well known outside as one which encourages 'Uncompassionate' & 'Cold' behavior in people.\r\n- The only way to grow is to create networking and sneak your way into other roles via personal connections. Talent plays very little role in MSFT , and being in MS-GD odds are heavely stacked against you. You will have superior success in leaving the firm and joining another consulting group outside.\r\n- MS-GD/MCS Services gets a new Leader every 2-3 years , who will come with grand visions, cause disruption via re-organizations, fail miserably and will be let go quietly with a generous severance package, While consultants on ground are left to clean up the mess. This has happened at-least 3 times and still no one is the wiser. At this point, it's a joke in wider industry circle.\r\n- 90% of the management layer has little to no customer facing experience , or a significant customer interaction experience or on-ground project insight in the last 5-10 years. As a result, their demands and expectations for field are almost always disconnected and ridiculously difficult.\r\n- Starting this year, the rewards ratio has been cut significantly , despite the company earning record revenue and the highest stock prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n- There is an exodus of talent from the group, which is increasing work pressure on existing teams and leading to more exists. There is a domino effect collapse in place and it's best to keep away from any offers being given out from this group."}, {"review_title": "Employee Friendly", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Engineering Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Employee friendly company\r\n- Benefits & perks", "cons": "- Work Life Balance (depends on team), Due to WFH extended hrs daily feels burnout"}, {"review_title": "Senior Cloud Solutions Architect", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "12 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Senior Cloud Solutions Architect", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best company to work and ok opportunities", "cons": "Slow career growth - who you know matters"}, {"review_title": "great place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Software Developer in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "work life balance, perks and people", "cons": "can get top heavy sometimes"}, {"review_title": "very good position for learning and sharing", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Mar 2022", "job_title": "CSAM", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "benefits\r\ngrowth mindset\r\na lot of resources", "cons": "very bureaucratic\r\nthings get stuck at some point"}, {"review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Infrastructure Architect", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get build along with the company.", "cons": "There is no specific cons"}, {"review_title": "Great com to work in", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Program Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good company to work in", "cons": "Salary not competitive to other IT companies"}, {"review_title": "nice", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer (SDE) in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "nice to be here, such a great platform", "cons": "couldn't get any cons as such"}], [{"review_title": "Best place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work culture \r\nCompetitive benefits", "cons": "Nothing as of now in cons"}, {"review_title": "Great work and impact", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Impactful projects to work on", "cons": "Salaries needs to become better"}, {"review_title": "Company goes above and beyond to avoid paying commission", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Digital Sales in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It's a good company to have on your resume", "cons": "Commission is spread over a 6 month period instead of quarterly to reduce accelerators\n\nCommission is capped at 180% \n\nMultiple different metrics that you need to hit 100% on which dilutes your chance of exceeding number\n\n25% of your commission is a \"bonus\" based on what you bring to the company.

Everyone at the company is super helpful and approachable and you do learn a lot. This is not true in Inside Sales though.\r\n\r\nI would recommend joining Microsoft over any other company but not Inside Sales.", "cons": "Can you guys do me a favour and please upvote this if you agree with me? I don't care about upvotes, I just want Microsoft to realize that the majority of people are on the same page when HR read those reviews.\r\n\r\nComing from someone who has tried several roles at Microsoft, I think I am more than qualified to talk about my Inside Sales experience and how it compares to other roles.\r\n\r\n1. The pay is a JOKE: Look, Dublin is in a SERIOUS SERIOUS housing crisis, which means that the salary you give is terrible based on what the living costs are. I can't believe a company like Microsoft gives those kinds of salaries in such an expensive city. But of course, who cares? The managers are at least above level 62 which means that they are super comfortable so why would they care? I'm not the first person who's mentioning the low salary. You need to revise this carefully and AT LEAST give a housing allowance. There is no budget is IMHO, a way to say: 'I am just not bothered to fight for this'. Of course there is no budget, do you think that upper management are just going to embrace us with their kindness and decide to raise salaries or give housing allowance without us fighting for it?\r\n\r\n2. Inside Sales at Microsoft is a 'hire anyone' philosophy. If you are expecting to work with talented and driven people, then look elsewhere. In my previous roles, I was working with super talented people because getting into those roles means that you have a lot to offer. In Inside Sales, they literally hire anyone. This is not a knock on the people I work with, it's just the fact that working at Microsoft comes with the expectation that you will work with talented people, which is true for other roles, but not Inside Sales.\r\n\r\n3. Visibility bubble: If you are smashing your numbers, I get it - you earned that visibility. But stop ccing managers whenever you breath. 99% of initiatives are pointless and add ZERO value. Upper management have no clue about the ins and outs of the job so they reward those with a lot of initiatives. I CANT stand this. I used to be a customer engineer at Microsoft and unless my initiatives bring clear measurable results, then they are pointless.\r\n\r\n4. Management: Guys, trust me when I say this. If you are at Inside Sales, you did not experience the Microsoft management philosophy. I worked with amazing managers in other organizations. So Microsoft, do yourself a favour and just get rid of all Inside Sales managers. How on earth do you become a manager if: You have zero empathy, you have no clue or even desire to understand the ins and outs of the job, you are a terrible communicator, and you have no clue how to inspire a team.
