Pay and benefits are great. Not excellent, but great.\r\n\r\n2. If you don't have great ambitions, you can maintain a good work-life balance. Once you get to the \"Senior\" level in the career ladder, it's easy to just relax and get lost among the cracks. Management is going to assume that you \"plateaued\", and let you stay where you are.\r\n\r\n3. Company pays a lot of importance to ethics and being a good world citizen. Pays generously to charities and has a great charity donation matching program.", "cons": "1. The company is too big and too slow. I don't know what exactly the reason for this is, but everything in the company just seems to happen so slowly, even down to minor everyday tasks such as getting a single bug fixed.\r\n\r\n2. People in the company are nowhere near as smart as some people think, particularly the new hires. In a market where companies like Google, Facebook, etc. are soaking up the cream of the crop, Microsoft has certainly lowered their standards and is settling for those who cannot make it into such companies. The really smart people are those that have been around for a decade or so, from back when Microsoft could attract those kind of people. The rest are probably still better than your average code-monkey, but nowhere near as good as they need to be to turn this company around. On rare occasions you come across some surprisingly incompetent people.\r\n\r\n3. Performance system is broken:\r\n\r\n- Rewards are tied to how much visibility the work you do has, i.e., the more the number of people who know what you are doing, the better your chances of a favorable performance rating. This may seem justified on paper, because the higher the \"visibility\" of your work, the more important it is. However, what ends up happening is that it basically becomes a popularity contest. You may be working on something that might be the most important thing for your immediate team, but since no one outside your team knows that, it is very unlikely you will be rewarded for your work. The \"new\" review system that was announced recently doesn't change any of this.\r\n\r\n- No matter what they tell you, there is definitely a minimum time period you need to be in each level before you get promoted to the next, no matter how good you are.\r\n\r\n- It's all about being in the right place at the right time. Good opportunities are hard to come by, and they keep moving around the company. Currently it looks like all the good opportunities are in the Windows Phone group. People there are getting promoted like crazy. Whereas in Windows, there is a huge dearth of good opportunities. And since the average seniority of employees in Windows in much higher, the few good opportunities go to the senior folks, leaving the junior folks with very little, making it hard to progress up the career ladder.\r\n\r\n4. Lack of good vision from leadership: Given the mess we are in right now, we need a Steve Jobs to turn us around.\r\n\r\n5. Ancient engineering practices: When I left school, I was eager to get into some actual software engineering and learn cool things like TDD, unit-testing, UML, etc. I am saddened to say that my co-workers and I are still writing code like it is for a class project. I think Microsoft relies more on a strategy wherein junior developers are just not given much important and complicated work until after they have gained a few years of experience. That's no way to do software engineering in today's world. While SDETs churn out huge, complicated, and heavy test frameworks for testing products, the reality is that these tests usually never catch any bugs, and most bugs are found in production.\r\n\r\n6. You better be prepared to spend the rest of your life working with Microsoft technologies: They avoid OSS and non-Microsoft solutions like the plague, which, to be fair, might be justified because of the potential for legal troubles. But if you are coming to work here, be prepared to say goodbye to the rest of the technology world."}, {"review_title": "Excellent experience @ scale", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "21 Dec 2013", "job_title": "Director in Redmond, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Incredible learning opportunity and many smart people.

If you newly join the company, you will spend quite some time doing the out-dated technologies.\r\n- \"Factory\", \"assembly line\" style process: this company is smart enough to \"streamline-lize\" its software development into something similar to Ford's assembly line. Working in that procedure gives you a strong feeling that you are one replaceable piece on it. \r\n- Management tries to get \"most mileage\" out of you: the management will try to make you work hard, overtime (while not explicitly say so to leave \"evidence\". One time I saw the manager explicitly wrote \"do more with less\", meaning getting more done with less people, in his commitment. Another time I heard the management using \"get enough mileage out of people\". They would make aggressive planning, use progress tracking software, status report meetings to force you into work over time. Not only that, during work it's highly intense, I had to make sure the previous scheduled tasks are made progress, and timely respond to boss' emails of ad-hoc tasks. Sometimes I need to switch between 5 desktop servers to run different tasks to get my assignments done. Looking back, every year there made me age 3-4 years. \r\n- Selfish culture. It boosted a culture that everybody try to strive to get what's within his own boundary done. And the company values the winner from internal competition (as the company is so big, upper management doesn't have time to judge who's right, so the simplest way I guess, is to see who's won out). From lower level, that means the peers just don't collaborate, but undermine each other. From bigger teams perspective, it's the fight between partners, and result in endless re-orgs. \r\n- Information control. The mid-management gives exactly information that you need to work on your piece of work. You don't know next reorg, you don't know the direction of the project. \r\n- \"Precision Question Answering\". There's this poisonous \"communication tool\" within Microsoft called \"Precision Question Answering\", it essentially trains people into using robotic-style conversations, so that the management can get the important information in the fastest way, and peers can challenge each other to fix logic errors in the details, at the cost of enjoying human-like collaboration between colleagues. \r\n- Compensation is terribly below the industry average level."}, {"review_title": "I had more creative freedom than I believe other sectors of the company have.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "13 May 2014", "job_title": "Editor in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great, diverse, creative team.

Mainly because the work quality below par and any average developer who is willing to work hard can succeed here. Smart people are totally unwelcome. Good ideas are totally unwelcome! \r\n3. Quality of work: This is just the place if you want to fix bugs in JavaScript! Or maybe if you want to spend your time figuring out how to write XML for using their horrendous internal framework. The best someone could tell me was they wrote some queries on Hive (in 2017 someone telling me that Hadoop is latest technology can only tickle a funny bone!).\r\n4. Promotions: Boss relies on \"I feel\" rather than on real data. \r\n5. No 1:1s with managers: In my first 5 months with my manager - there was only ONE 1:1. In that 1:1 - another person (my peer) was sitting with my manager. I repeat - the title for the discussion was 1:1!! Kudos!\r\n\r\nIn short - this is a perfect place to lose touch with coding skills (unless you consider writing XMLs or poorly written javascript as coding)."}, {"review_title": "Director", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "31 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Haryana in Gurgaon, Haryana", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Provides the breadth of options and aim for depth in any of those disciplines.

If you really just don't care about software or customers,  this is the software company for you. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft today is an exercise in political correctness run amok,  with leaders desperate for approval and well-sold (note I did not say GOOD) ideas and happy to throw money at them.   If you understand that kind of environment and want to either run at the new-style Brass Ring or simply surf along the edges - this is the company for you.   Go for it.

Because Mr. Ballmer and all of his directs - believe the same thing.  (unfortunately all the \"someone else's\" left with Bill).   It's also a fantastic place for HR and PR,  with it's high turnover and need to pretend to be an upscale software company and a great place for technical people to work,  and nirvana for corporate lawyers.   Check out the close links between Microsoft and Odell Guyton - the lawyer trying hardest to make \"ethics\" mean \"legal compliance\".  (ie,  if you're not actually breaking a law - right now, exactly - it must be ethical,  right?)  \r\n\r\nTo recap,  MS is a great place for anyone in the business of PRETENDING to build software.

You actually have to build the things you advertise and make them work? \r\n\r\nIf you're a technologist and can't get hired directly into a research group - you really don't want to work for Microsoft today.   Microsoft has suffered horribly since Ballmer took over.   He's a marketer.   He was always the guy who'd come stomping down the hallway going \"I WANT WHAT I WANT\".   We'd explain that the products couldn't actually do that and the reaction would be along the lines of \"AND WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?\"  If it was important,  we'd take the technical facts to Bill,  and Bill would intervene and shut him down.   It was a decent balance of power.   Ballmer's drive to do the impossible would get Bill to do things he wasn't inclined to do,  but only if they were POSSIBLE.   Yes, there was a time when I loved Microsoft and worked with great enthusiasm in that niche of the \"not technically impossible\".   I did a lot of risky things knowing that I could always count on Bill to rein things in when I could prove they weren't technically possible,  or so difficult they simply weren't practical.  \r\n\r\nBut Bill is gone now.  Since taking over,  Ballmer has promoted other similarly-minded marketers around him,  so now he's completely cocooned in layers of marketing fluff with absolutely no basis in reality.  He doesn't know the difference between an actual product and a picture of a product.  And just to improve the whole customer-focus and employee-focus thing - he's imported old IBM (Kevin Johson) and legacy Wal-Mart (Kevin Turner).   \r\n\r\nThe company used to be better and simpler.   Everything asking for millions of $$ went in front of Bill,  who would look skeptically at everything at a technical level and go \"um,  I don't understand how this actually gets built at all,  never mind on time or on budget.   SHOW ME.  CONVINCE ME.\"   People dreaded Bill's reviews but he weeded out the crap and he fired the liers.  Ballmer's a marketer.  He believes the crap and promotes the liers.\r\n\r\nAfter 8 years of Ballmer, you get Vista,  Office 7,  and Yukon (SQL2005) ... a suite of products that took 5-6 YEARS to release and on seeing them,  users are waiting for the next releases on the feeble hope that they'll be better.  \r\n\r\nIf you recognize this environment and you know how to manipulate it - you'll be in your element.
