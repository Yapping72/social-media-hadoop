The culture is rapidly moving from an open, innovative, and creative one to a highly politicized, disfuntional one. I would rate three of my last five managers as incompetent and totally incapable of managing people. I literally sat through a meeting listening to one manager spout what can only be described as a \"Dilbert Mission Statement\" stringing together big words into a completely incoherent jumble. I had more than a few managers who could not tell us what success in our positions would look like, nor could they define what our group was supposed to be accomplishing (the worst two of these have moved up in the company). I worked in an organization that had teams of people who could not define what their contribution was, nor could anyone else in the group. When I started at the company there was a clear open door policy and everyone was encouraged to communicate up the change as appropriate. By the time I left many organizations had established a clear \"chain of command\" and although the the official policy was still open door it was clear that you didn't go over your immediate managers head. \r\nWorst of all, Microsoft as devolved from a real customer-focused company to lumbering giant with little or no regard for the real source of its wealth.\r\nIf you strive for real accomplishment you can still find it at Microsoft but you may just as likely not find it.

Like grading on a curve, which makes no sense if you want to hire a bunch of really smart people and keep them all motivated and happy.

Oftentimes lip service is paid to \"Engineering Excellence\", and then scrapped immediately when Bizdev remembers something they should have told you months earlier. Good work goes unnoticed unless it's on some shiny, highly visible area; which is fine, except that it creates an environment where the basics aren't attended to because they're a career dead end and nobody wants to take that hit.

This level difference very badly affect if you try to internally movie to any other MS entity. Most of the cases you need to join as almost freshers in other MS entities though you have 7-10 years\u2019 experience and you are technically very sound. \r\n. Attrition rate is very high. Yearly 20-25% people leaving for last 3 years due to above reason/ politics, no opportunity etc. Onsite opportunity also reduced over the years.

Often these endeavours only take up valuable time, create more overhead and generally demotivate people.  \r\n\r\nAs Management is only interested in short term wins (Quarterly at best), calling customers is not rewarded because that implies long term relations, planning, complex engagements, etc. Instead, maintaining an inflated bubble-like pipeline full of nonsense is what is required to survive here. This has to be presented (and kept up-to-date daily) in MSX, Excel and Powerpoint all at the same time. There is no actual verification of work done and I can promise you that our pipeline is 95% FAKE and has been since I joined. \r\n\r\nPriorities seem to shift on a weekly basis, largely depending the quality of sleep our leadership had the night before.

Some really good people that are here since almost two years are still less paid than new hires (because they have realized that the salary was too low compared to the market, but they don't want to fix the situation for the old employees.)\r\n\r\n-Disrespectful: By paper and in theory, as a TSP you should be one of the most valuable people in sales. You can architect, design and solve technical problems. Nurture the customer with your knowledge, make him happy showing how magical is the cloud.\r\nUnfortunately, nothing about this happens.

You don't have and they don't think about it. Do you want to apply outside Inside Sales? Better not tell him that you work in this department, otherwise, they will not even look at you as they are fully aware of the situation here and the number of unnecessary people that work in this department.\r\n\r\n-Training: We have really good people at Microsoft that could teach us the technology behind this company.
