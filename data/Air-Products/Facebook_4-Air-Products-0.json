Frankly, it made me very sad because I am grateful for many good years there. Much of the leadership was very old school and it was very hard to get new innovative ideas heard. They became very behind the times. In 2014 the CEO was ousted - uh \"retired\" - and a new CEO was elected (Seifi Ghasemi). He made immediate changes and was restructuring the entire organization when my entire department was eliminated. Despite this I agree that the company needs to make drastic changes to survive, even though it had a negative affect on my employment. He has some good ideas to revitalize the company, but the expense is quite a number of employees. It has left those who remain overworked, without the proper knowledge since there was little transfer, and stressed. I do hope the company comes out on the other side a stronger, happier place to be. For now, I would avoid employment until they are more stable."}, {"review_title": "Good working environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Piping Material Engineer in Vadodara", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work culture and supporting staff", "cons": "work procedures need to be updated"}, {"review_title": "Data Analyst", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Data Analyst in Shanghai, Shanghai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Balanced Life and good coffee", "cons": "Nah maybe more motivated bonus"}, {"review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Supply Chain Analyst in Barcelona", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very easy to work with people across all levels of the company", "cons": "You have to work hard to move to other position"}, {"review_title": "management in crisis", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Payroll Sepcialist in Barcelona", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible hours, work remotly, autonomy", "cons": "manangement, salaries, objectives, no racialy diverse,"}, {"review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Jan 2021", "job_title": "CI Manager in Allentown, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good balance of strategic and tactical", "cons": "Technology was not up to par"}], [{"review_title": "Very Solid Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Air Products has a very familial culture.", "cons": "Pay could be better but it is reasonbably fair."}, {"review_title": "Protectionism", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Manager in Crewe, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary and hours were very good", "cons": "Nepotism and clique culture prevented any progress in new ideas"}, {"review_title": "Growing Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "16 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of growth and career opportunities.", "cons": "Not a lot of formal training programs."}, {"review_title": "Air Products", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Marketing", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very inclusive and open work environment", "cons": "The quantity of processes tend to slow down projects"}, {"review_title": "N/A", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Industrial Placement Student in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "All good no complaints at all", "cons": "no cons, was a very insightful year"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Administrative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to work but has changes it needs to make", "cons": "has changes it needs to make"}, {"review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Engineer in Pune", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Culture, diversity, flexibility, 5 days working, history", "cons": "No visit allowance for short duration"}, {"review_title": "Used to be a much better place to work", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "16 Jul 2020", "job_title": "Operations in Lexington-Fayette, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good job security.

They have implemented multiple internal projects to make the company a 'high performing organization,' but no one has bothered to collect any input as to how we currently execute projects or what will and won't work.

They keep a death grip on every group, tieing lower management's hands behind their backs, making it impossible to manage their teams effectively.  Any internal move must be lateral - no promotions - and your average promotion for high performers is 4-5 years.  The only way to climb the ladder is through the graces of your direct supervisor.  Luckily, lower management understands how bad it is and goes to bat for us, but they are told no by their leadership.  Plus, they are not given adequate budgets to properly reward their employees.  The result is high turnover as young engineers come here and stay 1-2 years before realizing what a train wreck this place is, while 50+ year old employees are just holding on for their pensions.
