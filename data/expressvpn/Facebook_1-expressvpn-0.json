Co-Founder/Co-CEO Peter Burchhardt is a classic psychopath/sociopath. He is horrible and abusive to his employees. If you don't do exactly what he wants and how he wants it done, he first tries to manipulate you to do it his way, and then he yells at you with all sorts of awful things and makes up lies about you. In fact, he tries to manipulate everyone around him. He says he invites open conversation, constructive feedback, etc, but as soon as he receives negative feedback from anyone, he lashes out at them, yells at them, and tries to embarrass them in front of their colleagues. It was awful sitting in meeting after meeting where he tries to publicly tear down a colleague because he doesn't like what they said, or they disagree with him. He's the most verbally abusive individual I've ever worked with. If he wasn't the CEO and co-owner, who also controls HR, he probably would have had many charges of workplace harassment filed against him. I truly believe he'd hurt his company for the benefit of his ego. The good reviews clearly come from people who don't have to work with him regularly or report to him. The other Co-Founder/Co-CEO, Dan Pomerantz, is reasonable by comparison. The attitude from many long time employees at ExpressVPN is Dan and Peter just dictate everything and expect their employees to execute blindly or face consequences. The company has a culture of people making excuses for both co-founders' bad behavior, which just perpetuates Peter's abusive behavior. The overall environment at ExpressVPN is very toxic, with people unwilling to work together, and certain people being nasty to each other. The co-founders also have no idea what direction to take the company and haphazardly move teams around every quarter expecting better results. In 2021 attrition was extremely high. They are also losing market share to competitors. The Kape acquisition was problematic for a lot of employees since Peter and Dan had 100% ownership of the company and didn't grant shares to any employees. That means they profited considerably off of the hard work of their employees, while we were only given a tiny acquisition bonus. If you like being abused, apply for a job here.

I had several rounds and met many different people of different seniority levels and on top of that I also had to submit some assignments, in order to really prove my ability. This did seem like quite a bit of work initially, but it completely makes sense in order for a company to really know for sure if a person is the right fit and the chemistry between team members would work out. \r\n\r\nI also asked for a little more time to complete my assignments as I told the recruiter at ExpressVPN that I had a lot of work on my plate at that time and I wanted to do the tasks the right way.
