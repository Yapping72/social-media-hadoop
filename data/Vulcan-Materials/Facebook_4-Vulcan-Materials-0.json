Employees can report problems to HR or upper management but ultimately nothing is done to resolve the problem. One department has had many employees \"laid off\" or \"let go\" but none of them have been replaced. Most departments are operating with a skeleton crew in which each employee is doing several different tasks or taking on the combined work that would have once belonged to two or more other employees. The employees are not being compensated or promoted. Vulcan's insurance plan was once excellent and a major reason why people would want to work for them, however, the benefits get worse each year while the price steadily increases. Also, you can forget about promotions in the company. Even if you obtain a degree you will be told that you do not have the experience to move into a position. The workforce has been greatly reduced and employees are taking on more responsibilities and, in some cases, doing the work that once belonged to 2 or 3 employees. The work has to be done but management becomes angry if the overtime budget is exceeded. Also, while Vulcan pays for employees to have short term disability (sick time is taken out of this) many managers become irate if employees take sick time. This appears to be due to reduced workforce as work quickly piles up because employees have no one to help take on their workload when they are absent.

Yet, if you reject the load, you get either fired, reprimanded, or retaliated against by dispatch sending you to the worse job and high possibility of getting in to an accident.  Trust me, I know.\r\nThey retaliate against employees for trying to sticking up for yourself: when your right, yet management blames you so they don't have to take the heat.\r\nHorrible working conditions.  The Ready Mix trucks they own are unsafe and dangerous - trucks flip over taking left and turns going 5 MPH, tires constantly blow on highways while fully loaded, dispatch will \"forget\" about you when your broken down with an expensive load and tell you a mechanic is on the way, but yet he has no idea your broken down.  So when that load goes bad, you tell your manager you called dispatch for a mechanic, dispatch will cover there own job and lie which leads to you getting fired.\r\nFederal Law says trucks cannot be hauling more than 5 yards on the Interstates Highways, well, they carry 9.5-10, so the drivers are taking the loads bellieving it's okay, when it's actually against the law (they won't tell you that, but with my recent meeting with The Department of Transportation, they said it is \"highly illegal and dangerous\".\r\nYou work the worst hours possibly.  15+ hour days, with a \"mandatory\" 8 hour break in between shifts) yet they won't obey that.  You'll come in at 1a.m, work until 5 or 6 p.m (again, breaking 15 hours) then clock out and you find out your start time the next day is at 12a.m  (6-7 hour break) and at the end of the year they will tell you that your load count needs to increase while giving you a $.10 raise while management is getting massive bonuses and raises.\r\nFavortism is to the point that Batchman, and dispatch will try very hard to get you transferred to another division, or drive you out of the job just so their favorites don't have to take the last load or violate..\r\nHR is goody-goody with management.  I filed a grievence asin't my manager for trying to load me up at 14 hours and 54 minutes to go to a job 25 miles away, at 5pm in the afternoon, with the only way to get there is to go on the interstate.  When I expressed me concern about violating he told me to take it and \"i'll make an accepetion for the FMSCA law\" (How can you do that for a law??) anyways, i was about to back my truck up to the plant to get loaded because if didn't then i'd be fired.  So even though I didn't want too, I got in my truck but heard over the radio from my back up batchman (plant operator)  not to back up the plant.  It turns out that dispatch voided my ticket after being grilled by my back up plant operator that I'd violate...  So they told me to wash out, park my truck and go home..  Well, I ended up getting written up for \"rejecting\" that load, when I NEVER DID!  i explained my part of the story about how dispatch told me to wash out.. Well he tells me that he made his decision and that dispatch said I rejected the load.. When I had 8 witnesses telling my manager that it didn't happen like that.. I still got written up.  \r\nThe next Monday I go in to work with wires hanging out the back of a truck (mine was in the shop), the back lights didn't work, there was a hole in the hopper that would blow cement powder over cars following me, and 2 tires were flat.  After my PTi I deemed the truck unsafe to drive.  I tell my Plant Operator, and he tells me that if i didn't take the truck and get loads out, he will contact my manager.  In a normal company, that'd be okay, i'd say \"go for it the truck is broken\", yet at VMC, management will side with the batchman and completely disregard the driver.  Well i refused to drive it and he called my manager and he suspended me for \"slashing the tires and pulling the wires out myself\" when that was impossible, I had people around me while I was doing my PTI and they told my manager that i didn't do it and they were with me... he still suspended me and blamed me while laughing saying \"i should have taken the truck\".\r\nI filed a Grievence and when I went to a mediation (with my manager present) The HR guy asked me why I was in this office with him when I haven't had any infractions, write ups (until 2 weeks before)  and had been a \"perfect employee\".. I explained my situation and really focused on the 15 hour violation and how it's against the law and even though we are told not to violate, but when it comes down to it we are written up or fired.  The HR guy said \"well that is a grey area in this company that will always exist.  Management has to make that decision everyday, but rest assured, if ANYTHING happens, it falls on the manager\"\r\nWell that's false, 'cause drivers have been forced to take loads after 15 hours, and something always happens, whether it be an accident or whatever, but when the cop asks why your over 15 hours and you tell him you were told by the manager it was okay.. The cop explains to you every time, that if you are caught behind the wheel of a commercial vehicle after 15 hours, it is 100% your fault because you are considered fatigued.  Also,  when your manager arrives and the cop asks if he gave permission to take the load, the manager covers his job and says something along the lines of \"we have a policy that states that driver should know when they are going to violate and communicate that to management, I never recieved a call from this driver\"  \r\n\r\nit's absolutely disgusting.\r\n\r\nP.S.  If your single, it works, if you have a family or baby due soon, don't expect to get off for the baby being born, a driver as on stand by at the end of the day, when he got a call from his wife's friend asking where he was at, they were at the hospital because his wife was in the middle of labor and she called his manager to tell him that (drivers aren't allowed to have cell phones in trucks)  they wrre on the way to the hospital an hour ago.  Well the manager didn't tell the driver, didn't get on the radio to inform him of his daughter being born, or even call the Plant Operator to tell him because the driver had been at the plant for 4 hours on stand by doing nothing but sitting in his truck..  The driver responded to her wife's friend that nobody told him anything..  When he confronted the manager, the manager said he never got a phone call from anybody.  I was right by the driver when all this happened.  if you have a family and request off to spend time with them on a saturday, they won't let you because it's a work day."}], [{"review_title": "Unsafe Practices", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Moody, AL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Family oriented.
