Are you willing to spend a year of hell to do this though?", "cons": "Tips * Do not be fooled by the name change, \u201cRakuten Advertising\u201d has NOTHING to do with an advertising role. They most definitely changed the name of the company from Rakuten Marketing because of the bad reputation it has.\r\n\r\n\u2028* The awards they win means nothing and has zero to do with how \u201cwell\u201d the company is run or how \u201ctalented\u201d the senior staff are.\u2028\r\n\r\n- As soon as you start the training videos are mind-numbingly boring and so outdated that the system they use doesn\u2019t even come close to correlating with it. The videos are pointless and you learn nothing wasting 1 week of your time doing this. There is no additional training beyond this.\r\n\r\n- Very toxic work culture. The majority of people are young and it\u2019s a very cliquey high school atmosphere. People talk behind everyone\u2019s back and it\u2019ll chip away at your self-confidence as you go into work every day.\r\n\r\n- A lot of two-faced people in the company- You\u2019ll never be confronted for a mistake you make, instead, they\u2019ll go behind your back and tell your line manager. Your line manager will not hear you out first, they'll point the blame at you and tell you to do better without any constructive advice.\r\n\r\n- As an account manager, you\u2019ll have on average 8-11 clients, even if you tell your line manager it\u2019s too much work, due to the high turnover you\u2019ll be loaded on with even more clients even when you already work from 8 am to 8 pm every day.\r\n\r\n- You don\u2019t get any overtime pay or any time back. Flexi hours is a joke and should be taken off from the CV, that\u2019s their loophole to get you to work more.\r\n\r\n- The only quiet period is August, the rest of the year is manic, you\u2019re overworked, will do 12 hour days, and still get complained at for missing one of the literal one thousand emails that get sent into your inbox every day.\r\nSo many pointless meetings, you have hour-long meetings \r\n\r\n- 3 x a week baring in mind you don\u2019t have enough time in the day to do your own work.\r\n\r\n- If you have 10 clients, that\u2019s one 45 minute call with your client per week. 45 minutes x 10= 450 minutes (7.5 hours). You also have quarterly reviews with each client and a tonne of admin work.\r\n\r\n- The work is not fulfilling, take a deep think before you considering joining an affiliate career, it\u2019s mostly mind-numbing admin work, with calls and presentations. A lot of your workload would be lessened if they automated the admin side.\r\n\r\n- It\u2019s common not to pass your 3-month probation, everyone\u2019s too busy with their suffocating workload to help you with anything you\u2019re stuck on. I\u2019ve seen colleagues' loved ones dying during their probation and the company not being understanding of the situation and still laying people off. Anyone who does not pass their probation, the managers send that person home that day, hold a meeting after with the team, and says \u201c x will not be working here anymore if you have any questions come and ask us\u201d\r\n\r\n- If you\u2019re in your probation and you realise it\u2019s not for you, the management will hold another meeting, embarrass you in front of everyone and say \u201cthey have decided not to work with Rakuten, can you tell us why?\u201d I\u2019ve seen it happen to other people and it\u2019s such a toxic way of doing things.\r\n\r\n- Nepotism is the core culture of this awful company\r\n\r\n- They pride themselves on being transparent, they\u2019re anything but. You\u2019ll be forced to move to a different role you didn\u2019t agree to. They don\u2019t ask you, you\u2019re told. CEO\u2019s leave and you\u2019re not told why and to mind your own business. There have also been sexual harassment cases that are swept under the rug.\r\n\r\n- You have to deal with mean clients (unless you\u2019re very lucky), annoyed publishers, and unskilled managers. It\u2019s the most stressful job I have ever had in my life\u2026.by far.\r\n\r\n- A pay rise is non-existent here, if you ask for a slightly higher increase, management will call you money hungry. They either promote you or don\u2019t.\r\n\r\n- You\u2019ll be expected to work the next role up for a good 6 months before they even consider promoting you- all with no additional pay of course. \r\n\r\n- Very high turn over, 20-25 people left when I worked there for a year (all these were from client-facing roles). They have such a high turnover that they probably won\u2019t even know which ones of their many, unhappy account managers left this review.\r\n\r\n- DO NOT TRUST the fake reviews- everyone is miserable and is ready to throw anyone under the bus just to get promoted or to remain in the good side with the management.\r\n\r\n- If you ask about the bad glass door reviews in your interview, they\u2019ll just tell you what they told me which is \u201cWe\u2019re taking measurements to sort this all out\u201d then you waste a year and realize you should have trusted your gut instinct and never joined the company."}, {"review_title": "everything feels just right so far", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Site Reliability Engineer in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "everything feels just right so far", "cons": "there is nothing really bothered me so far"}, {"review_title": "Good company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Teacher in Sendai, Miyagi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a friendly and nice company to work for.", "cons": "May not hire foreign staff.

Human resource department says, \"there are a lot of opportunities to grow and promoted because Rakuten is still seeking challenges and will give many business responsibilities\".

Some departments are more English-ized than others and some demand a level of Japanese far higher.  This company is a great way to get to Japan and work in a professional setting for a few years before moving on.\n\n- The CEO is visible and accessible at the weekly morning meetings.  Want to ask him a question?  Submit it and he might answer.  These meetings take a lot of criticism for the discipline they require (arrive at 7:57 AM or earlier, or face punishment) and the time they waste, but you *do* get an opportunity to talk with the CEO in person.\n\n- Cafeteria provides three meals a day.  Be aware that breakfast ends early and dinner begins late; you will be working uncompensated hours to get this \"free\" food.  And perhaps they are hoping that by eating in-house, people will not notice that the salaries they pay are not enough to make a habit of eating out in the (quite expensive) neighborhood.\n\n- Friendly to disabled and LGBT employees \u2014 though there are few women in upper management. Parental leave exists.  And of course the company is one of the most foreign-friendly in Japan.  \n\n- Modern, pleasant-looking office environment with adjustable-height desks.  Not all of the sub-companies have this (the upper floors are like something out of 1984), but if you're lucky you'll be in a sub-company with this kind of feel.\n\n- Work-life balance is nothing like the horror stories you will hear about certain Japanese companies like Dentsu and NTT.  However (moving on to the Cons)...", "cons": "- ...your salary includes 30-40 hours of overtime (meaning if you work 43 hours of OT in a month, you get paid for 3 of them).  But in some of the sub-companies, if you ever arrive a minute late, you have to consume half a day of PTO.  Which is a part of...\n\n- A petty, pervasive frugality, with cost-cutting disguised as energy-saving.  Indoor temperatures of 28\u00b0C; elevators only stopping on certain floors which rotate each month; a PTO system where paid time off is hard to take.  \n\n- The company's biggest obsession: Rules.  Other reviewers have described the rules about nametags, clean desks, locked drawers, and other things in great detail: they are all true and the system will try your patience.\n\n- The other obsession is with KPIs and \u2018kaizen\u2019 (incremental improvement).  Every employee must set five to seven measurable goals every six months and then complete them.  And because everyone around you is constantly having to come up with goals that can definitely be completed, there will be barely-meaningful changes made to your workflow around you.  Get an inexplicable demand to, forevermore from this point, copy-paste some data into a second spreadsheet before saving, to prevent a 1% chance of fat-fingering something? Probably someone's KPI/kaizen requirement.  These requirements do not decrease with time; you will have to set new goals at the same rapid pace in your twentieth half=year as in your second half-year.\n\n- Lots of intimidation and \"power harassment\" and overworked middle management taking their frustrations out on their subordinates.  Assuming you are not a local, even if your Japanese is *excellent*, you might struggle to deal with these situations.  A screaming Japanese boss can *destroy* your self-worth; do not discount this.  And with turnover so high, you can never settle in with a boss with whom you have good rapport.  Odds are he\u2019ll be gone in 12-18 months and you will be back at the starting line trying to impress a new boss who may or may not have expected to have a non-Japanese subordinate.\n\n- With that in mind, there are *very few* non-Japanese in management roles; even middle management.  The amount of paperwork and documentation demanded of middle management probably means you don't want to rise to that level, unless your Japanese is native-like and effortless.  Those things, unlike \"Asakai\" morning meeting presentations, are not done in English.\n\n- Salaries, while normal by Japan's standards, basically never go up unless you're in management or one of the top 5-10% of performers.  Tremendous pressure on middle management to cut costs in every way means that no matter how hard you work, you probably won't be rewarded.  Software engineers in particular could make much more in the USA.  You would also have enough vacation to visit Japan once a year and still come out far ahead financially."}, {"review_title": "Pretty decent experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "1 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Applications Architect in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I've been working in Tokyo HQ, tech department.

Much more so than at any other company for which I've worked. There are people from more than 60 countries working here.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is very non competitive compared to other countries. Your performance or lack thereof won't significantly affect your compensation. If you're a team player, you have teammates who try their best in good faith (most do), and you don't like being pitted against  your peers you may enjoy this style. People form close relationships with their teammates in the absence of intense competition - you can make some good friends (nice for someone moving in from outside the country).

Middle managers generally don't know or can't understand what their staff are working on and focus on verifying that everyone is at their desk from 9am to at least 5:30pm.\r\n\r\nIf you're on the business side, you may have to be at your desk from 8:30am to 9pm instead of 9am to 5:30pm. You don't have to work, but you must be in the office.

Team building aside, this policy favors the lazy and leads to low levels of workmanship in many instances.\r\n\r\nNo one can argue with decisions made by the CEO. All managers fear to displease him. Many rules are obviously passed down from the CEO with no oversight - for example - we didn't have flex time for many years because the CEO heard (incorrectly, they actually banned remote working) that Yahoo banned flex time due to staff goldbricking. For another anecdote, I was told by colleagues in a branch office that they were instructed to remove all personal items, monitors, etc. from their desks before the CEO visited their branch because he prefers to see clear desks. I suspect CEO related problems are the root of many of Rakuten's other problems.\r\n\r\nI have the strong impression that HR is attempting to gradually roll back secondary benefits in order to cut costs (cost cutting necessitated presumably by unfortunate business decisions made by the CEO). For example, during my five years at the company they have provided a special lunch for vegetarians at the company (which is a big plus in Japan). When I joined they allowed vegetarians to sign up to receive one of two lunchboxes each day with a vegetarian dish. After four years they changed from the lunchboxes to having the food dished out onto a tray (no problem here). Then after a couple months they decreased the number of selections to one (no real problem yet, but the erosion has begun). Then, they banned all non-Indian employees from registering to eat vegetarian food (there are no enforced laws against discrimination in Japan). After another month or two they then decided to decrease the amount of total food available so that of the 600 or so vegetarians at the company, there is only food for 1/2 - 2/3 of them. Now a long line forms for the vegetarian food earlier in the lunch hour. You must show up early to wait lest you be one of the unfortunate ones who lose their chance to get catered lunch that day.  \r\n\r\nThe above case only applies to vegetarians, but you may want to consider if it's a good idea to work for a company that tempts you in with advertised benefits and then slowly shaves them away as much as they can without causing too many people to quit. Also, do you want to work for a company which behaves this way when doling out benefits, bonuses, and raises? (HR must approve all raises even if your own boss requests one)\r\n\r\nThe salary you have when you join will be very similar to the one you have when you quit (not much chance for any big raises even if you gain more experience or responsibility).\r\n\r\nNo vegan food - if you're vegan you'll be cooking for yourself."}, {"review_title": "Dynamic Interesting Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of opportunities for advancement\r\nGlobal company, part of much larger conglomorate\r\nLocal leadership cares and is connected\r\nGood work/life balance\r\nOpportunities for Global assignments", "cons": "Rigid advancement schedules\r\nArbitrary limits on raises, seriously caps rewards for high performing employees\r\nLittle to no talk/feedback on salary negotiation (raises are \"given\", never discussed)\r\nSome issues with over-promoted/unqualified management\r\nProcess hell (internal systems out-dated, manual, and not integrated)"}, {"review_title": "The Bay Area Needs more companies like Rakuten", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous in San Mateo, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Large company stability, startup opportunity\r\nInnovative culture\r\nFriendly, open minded forgiving population\r\nGlobally recognized brand (FC Barcelona, GS Warriors Jersey Sponsor)\r\nGreat crossover  business opportunity and collaboration\r\nClear and inspiring company values and mission statement\r\nSupportive, compassionate leadership\r\nInspiring, bold CEO and leadership", "cons": "Acquisition integration is not always well planned or thought out"}, {"review_title": "top-down management style, 1 level up manager means the world.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Product Manager in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "nice office and facilities, decent benefit. good for socialising since there are a lot of clubs to join or one can starts a new one. decent working hours for tech department", "cons": "personal growth is not much valued, changing in organisation structures frequently so sometimes you got thrown into a completely new team\r\nBe prepared for a lot of interviews and even after getting the offer, they asked for reading the CEO's book and an essay for that which doubtfully anyone ever read that (sounds a little dictated style). there were a lot of unnecessary meetings from top managers. they provide a good platform to work on, it depends a lot on the company performance that value-added to your benefit."}, {"review_title": "Unreasonably low compensation & very Japanese culture", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Feb 2015", "job_title": "Software Engineer in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free Lunch : \r\nThis is really something you can cherish about Rakuten.

I waited for 3(ish) months before posting this as I wanted a clear / balanced perspective.\r\n\r\nI know open layout is the de-facto default plan at many companies in Japan however -\r\nthis place feels like the Ministry of Truth from 1984. There are also far too many people for the space provided. Extra points to see how many people you infect when you come to work sick. We are crammed in so close as to feel the body heat of the adjacent people - I've never felt so claustrophobic before. Join Rakuten with the expectation of no personal space or privacy.\r\n\r\nExpect to drink the Rakuten koolaid or be ostracized by management. The cult of personality is very strong here. Expect most people to treat the CEO as if he is the second coming of the savior and the \u201cRakuten Shugi\u201d is the bible. Expect to be required to install Rakuten apps on your personal devices (also strictly enforced). Constructive criticism is not welcomed - it is seen as complaining and thus ignored. They even went to far as to get rid of Yammer a while back to silence employees. Everything is a KPI, everything requires a document, approval, attendance record or a long list of convoluted rules. Micro-management and shaming tactics (for the smallest of clerical mistakes) are taken to an Olympic levels here. I frequently thought \u201cResistance is futile\u201d when dealing with most things. \r\n\r\nYour desk must be clean - no personal effects in or around it. Desk and chair cleaning (even the chair wheels) every Monday by staff - strictly enforced. The company culture is extremely impersonal. If the building was hit by a comet, at most I would have lost a box of tissues in my desk. It gives off the feeling of you being part (cog) of the larger machine that is indifferent to your humanity (which they are).\r\n\r\nThe company PR department is good - which is bad for you. The website has many foreign nationals posing for pictures telling you how good it is. Those people are either  a) Executive Level b) Management Level c) Gone.  It gives the illusion of a flexible progressive workplace, for which it is the exact opposite. \r\n\r\nIf you want to get promoted you need to speak, act and preferably be Japanese. While you might see many non-Japanese during your time here, the majority of those individuals are not in management. As a non-Japanese, there are a (very) few ways to get promoted upward. Basically the requirements are politicking (brown-nosing) with executives, or being heavily connected in Silicon Valley or with Harvard / HBS. If you fall outside that sphere - the best of luck to you. Additionally, I must give an honorable mention to the completely incomprehensible elearning that everyone is required to take for promotion - no exceptions. The entire thing (100s of pages of presentation and several tests) is machine translated from Japanese. It wouldn't be so bad, but they outright refuse to fix nor acknowledge it as being a problem.\r\n\r\nSemi-ok food but they have absurd limits on lunch (like only two baby tomatoes, one spoon of lettuce, 3 meatballs etc.). Word has it Rakuten low-balled the caterer on the contract which in turn shows in the quality of the food.\r\n\r\nDo not expect to have training, joining parties or events, or some travel expenses paid for you. The company is cheap - and everything comes out of your pocket. While they will reimburse you for required travel, understanding the reimbursement process is like filing multi-year tax complicated forms to the National Tax Agency without a CPA. Best of luck with that.\r\n\r\nDid I mention the stupid menial tasks? If so, it requires its own section. Expect to have irrelevant documentation, attendance, useless KPIs and PowerPoints to take of 25% of your day. Bikeshedding and other useless minutia in meetings will take up another 30%+ of your time and 90% of your sanity.\r\n\r\nAs another poster said \u201cCaveat emptor\u201d for which I wholeheartedly agree. If you still decide to join or not is your personal decision. However, if you do I suggest getting a DETAILED breakdown of your compensation package. Rakuten likes to play \u201csemantics\u201d with peoples money. One glaring example - the \u201cbonus\u201d (deferred salary) is actually a large percent of stock options that only vest after a half a decade; however, it is still listed as cash in the joining email they send you. Just do your due diligence to avoid any \u201cregretful misunderstandings\u201d later."}, {"review_title": "Sales... frustrating.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Sales Representative", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Overall company vision is great!  Being able to use first party data from all of Rakuten's companies to have a more targeted approach to digital marketing is industry-defining and grandiose.  \r\n- A lot of GREAT players in the company with big visions themselves and the abilities to take the company there.  \r\n- Deep pockets from Rakuten to fund technology and innovation.

People are sticking around, and are getting promoted.  This company is ripe for all-stars to come in and make a difference, and make their careers out of it.\r\n- Relatively transparent.

Neither have my prospects.  \r\n- Everybody keeps hanging on, waiting for the technology and infrastructure to catch up to our vision.  I'm not so sure that's going to happen soon.  In the next 5 years?  Sure.  In the next 5 months?  No.  \r\n- Constant changes to infrastructure, but not in ways that we think make sense.  There should be one sales team that sells all digital products, not 4 sales teams that sell one digital product each.  Because of this, Salesforce is a mess, so everybody keeps prospecting into each other's accounts.  Imagine 4 different reps from the same company selling their own product going after the same contact within a company... The term \"wild wild west\" is muttered in almost every sales meeting.  Some business units don't even have territories, they just have sales reps and prospecting reps spraying emails and praying.\r\n- Sales talent.  There might be 5-10 really qualified salespeople within the sales teams that are legitimately good sales reps.  But then there are 40-50 sales people who just plain suck, some with no background in selling media or affiliate or SEM.  One of the biggest issues here is the comp structure: there are no ramping commissions; you only make money once you close your first deal, which could take 3-6 months.  With that being said, how can RM expect to recruit high-performing sales talent from other organizations?  If the idea is to get young, coachable sales reps to grow organically within the org, then say so.  \r\n- Global organization means a LOT of emails to people you don't know.  Need help with an HR issue?  Ask around to see who handles HR so you can email them.  Computer issues?  Ask around to see if there is a resource on-site who can help.  Need help getting your phone set up on company email?  Good luck, email around to see who the right contact is, from your laptop.  Need an account manager from another business unit to get information about a client?  Email, email, email.  \r\n- Comp plan.  It is hard to know how much money you will actually make.  If you are used to digital marketing, this might not be a big deal to you.  However, if you are coming from software sales or some other type of sales org, you may have difficulty predicting what your paychecks will look like.\r\n- Sales training.  If you are new to ad tech or digital marketing, you will need to do a lot of studying and learning on your own.  Although there is a certain amount of training that is set up at the beginning, there is not enough follow-on training to keep you going.\r\n- Marketing materials and messaging needs work.  We have some great people in the marketing department, but some of the creative choices made by our CMO don't portray at all what we are trying to achieve.  The website sucks.

What are we trying to sell?"}, {"review_title": "Unappreciated and Undervalued", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1) Nice new office space in Central London\r\n2) Free breakfast on Wednesday's and free lunch on Fridays\r\n3) Drink share on Friday's starting at 4pm", "cons": "1)\tTraining isn\u2019t in person and you listen to audio recordings of what you need to know.

Simply put, management really lack management experience. \r\n\r\n3)\tThey say they want you to have a work life balance and provide flexi hours but for the Complete Affiliate team, Account Managers and upper management come in at 8am and leave past 6pm, and makes you feel bad if you come in at 9am and leave exactly at 6pm. \r\n\r\n4)\tThere are an abundance of mandatory meetings that take up an incredible amount of your time and majority of them aren\u2019t relevant to the teams or UK market (team meetings, 1-2-1 meetings, all company meetings, affiliate meetings).You aren\u2019t allowed to miss them even if you have important and more pressing work to finish i.e. an account review. On top of that management blames you for not having time management skills when there is literally not time do anything due to the meetings and the numerous accounts you handle. Which leads me to my next point...\r\n\r\n5)\tDistribution of accounts is incredibly uneven. You can have one Account Manager managing 12 accounts and another one just managing 6. When you bring this up to management they tell you that you just have to deal with. Not only is the distribution of accounts uneven, the workload between Account Coordinators is even more so uneven where you will have a set of 5 coordinators but only one (1) MAYBE two (2) picking up the work. \r\n\r\n6)\tThey switch Account Managers around so often that a client can start with one Account Manager at the start of the year, and towards the end have another one due to just shuffling of accounts. \r\n\r\n7)\tExtremely high turnover rate, 2017 alone there have been 7 people who have left the Affiliate Complete team. One client account is already on its third (3rd) Account Manager for the year due to two (2) of its Account Managers leaving the company. \r\n\r\n8)\tThere is no motivation for you to succeed or progress in this company. They say they hire within first, however during my time here every time an Account Manager has left, they have hired outside personnel instead of promoting those within who actually put a lot of work in and deserve that promotion.

San Franciso is the corporate end of the company, and Beloit is the Member Services end, where work seems more laid back and life is easy going so long as you do what is expected of you.\r\n\r\nMoving on, there are some legitimate concerns I have working here. One of which is how critical I see some people be of others' mistakes. The best thing to do when you see someone make one is to let them know so they don't do it again and then life goes on. However, when you work here you can get in trouble for doing that. If you have an issue with someone or you believe they should be doing something differently, you are supposed to report it to their supervisor. That's understandable. However, sometimes this feedback is not passed along, and the situation remains unchanged. \r\n\r\nThen, some people tend to think that the person they work with just isn't fit for the job in some ways, and in some scenarios I've seen it cause them to be somewhat ostracized, all because some feedback isn't reported. \r\n\r\nAnother issue is between Tier 1 and Tier 2 representatives. Basically, if an issue with a member can't be handled by a Tier 1 rep, they are supposed to send it to Tier 2 which has their own process of handling member inquiries. The issue arises when Tier 2 submits feedback to Tier 1 saying that they could have technically handled it themselves, or they were missing some information before escalating the ticket to them. Feedback is all fine and good, but I've seen some Tier 2 reps be far too critical of certain mistakes. And then there comes a point when most Tier 2 reps will stop submitting feedback because it doesn't reach the Tier 1 rep or the rep keeps making the same mistakes with no recourse or reprimand. On the other side of the coin,  Tier 1 has this sort of an deep-seeded animosity for Tier 2 because of how critical they can be over small things that leads them to ignore even valid and constructive feedback that could save them some hair-pulling during Quality Reviews. It's hard to get into it without going into heavy details, but the gist of it is that Tier 1 and Tier 2 are like two siblings arguing and poking one another in the back of the car while Management is driving the car, unaware of it all.\r\n\r\nDespite these things, it's still a great place to work and we all tend to get along unless you get involved with stupid, petty office drama. I've been there, and I can say it's best to just avoid it as much as possible. Nothing but grief comes from it.

So if you try to correct, you will be excluded from the team. \r\n2) Since the project is wrong and it will fail, the MBA and engineer will be blamed. So no way to escape. \r\n3) MBA must approve all the wrong decisions because all the legacy of current problems are caused by the actual managers and leaders and they want to hide from the president. \r\n4) Again, employees with MBA will be blamed. And you have to confirm that it was your idea and you were incapable to find the problems.\r\n5) The managers are bullies because it is the only way to make to respect them (by fear). In case you don't do what they tell you to do: a) If you was assigned from Japan, probably you will be assigned back to Japan and never again assigned to US again. b) If you are US employee, you will be fired or invited to leave very quick. After you leave the company, all the current problems will be assigned to you. It is how they survives and hides the problem. So they are always hiring new employees.\r\n6) Evaluations. they evaluate your performance in 1 to 7 scale. Here is the problem, you work very hard to try to meet impossible goal and of course you will fail in something like deadline. They will give you 1, no matter how many times you worked until late or at home. \r\n7) Only way to be promoted is to enter in their circle. It means you have to support them and act like them. If you can't be like them, you will probably be target to their bullying and get fired, blamed,.... Therefore, competent people does not fit under their management.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Rakuten manager profile are:\r\n- bad education background or education not related to the business like graduation in education, philosophy , music school, ex-pilot( yes pilot)\r\n- Dubious credentials.

They will believe in you if you tell in the interview that you are graduated in Harvard or have Scrum Master certification.\r\n- Not ethical and honest\r\n- They do not hesitate in blame someone for their faults.\r\n\r\nPs.: Japan Rakuten Card is worst. They are the source of current management in Card US.

I was a mid-career hire (not a new grad) who came in with about 5 years experience in my field.\r\n\r\nRakuten has a miserable company culture.  From insane levels of micro-management, expected and unpaid overtime work, extremely low pay with barebones benefits (the legal bare minimum of paid time off, zero retirement benefits, no work from home, etc.), to being given responsibilities that actually amount to a step backwards in your career, spending the working day at Rakuten was a very negative experience.  Oh, and when you join the company, you get absolutely nothing- no garbage can, no notebook, not even a single pen.  Rakuten takes zero effort in making new employees feel welcome, and it's no wonder the turnover is so high.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of my career there, I was told to, \"Be sure to stay overtime a few times a week, just to show your manager that you are engaged in your job.\"  In this way, results don't matter at Rakuten.  What matters is just sitting at your desk, and being there physically (even if, like a majority of the company, you are simply wasting time chatting with other coworkers on Viber).  You aren't promoted for your efforts, but are instead promoted every six months (by an insulting amount of around 8000 yen a month) simply for staying at Rakuten.  \r\n\r\nRakuten is such a bloated organization with so much redundancy that large numbers of the workforce don't do anything all day (except Viber, Facebook, etc.).  If you want to do nothing all day, Rakuten may be a good place for you.  It is not a good place for people who are motivated to develop their careers and gain new experiences.  Additionally, you can't move up because the clueless middle managers don't support you, don't give you initiatives to evolve your career, and really don't give any direction at all.  They are only managers because they have been at Rakuten physically for several years.  Upper management, on the other hand, is almost always hired externally.  Employees will almost never move up in the organization, and this is even more true for non-Japanese employees.\r\n\r\nYou are never rewarded for doing a good job, but are scolded to almost laughable amounts if you make a mistake.  As one example, I forgot to lock my desk once before going home.  My superior then felt it was appropriate to: 1) message me on Viber on a Friday night telling me I forgot to lock my desk, 2) bring it up at the morning team meeting on Monday, 3) send an email to me, CCing my team members and boss, saying that I forgot to lock my desk, and 4) place a piece of paper with \"CLOSE!\" written in red letters inside of my desk.  All for one fairly benign mistake.  Just one example of how Rakuten treats its employees like children, does not trust any of their employees (security cameras ALL OVER the office spaces/cafeteria/everywhere), and makes working there miserable in general.\r\n\r\nLots of gossip, slander, and backstabbing at Rakuten.  Managers will steal your ideas so that they get credit.  One lady in upper management openly talks about employees' salaries, brags about her own salary and how much her MBA cost (she told me $200K USD), spreads rumors about other employees, and engages in name calling regularly.  \r\n\r\nI could go on and on with more examples, but this post would become much too long.  And among all of this, they tried to implement something called the \"Smile Project.\"  Indeed, the CEO thinks that all of the problems at his company can be solved by getting employees to greet each other by fist bumping.  This is not a joke!  They even have reminders in the elevators to please fist bump each other, but in elevator-friendly silence.\r\n\r\nThe real icing on the cake is listening to the CEO at the Tuesday morning asakai meetings.  While Rakuten's employees are getting paid far, far below the industry average, employees are \"privileged\" enough to watch live streams of the CEO's unfocused, meandering, broken-English reports from and bragging about his home in Silicon Valley, his suite in New York, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nA terrible company that I can only recommend as a stepping stone to joining a better company after putting in 6 months to a year of enduring this awful place."}, {"review_title": "Avoid at all costs-I am leaving ASAP", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some good people, food at times", "cons": "I do not wish to spend 30 minutes writing all the issues.

I very much enjoy working at Linkshare. First of all, the company as whole tries very hard to be positive, to keep employee morale up, and to foster a fun environment to work. We have group outings (paid for by the company), karaoke nights, tons of office parties, and many have been known to break open a bottle of wine in the office on Fridays. It's seriously a fun place. \r\n\r\nIf fun isn't your thing- Linkshare also has great people. You end up working with some of the nicest, friendliest folks you can imagine. They love to work but they don't foster annoying competitiveness, and they never put each other down. I can say its truly a team environment. My bosses are very understanding- they allow us to talk to them about any concerns we might have, they ask us about our career path, how they can help us grow, and always keep their ends of the bargain. We are often able to work from home, we get tons of vacation time, we get to go home on time most days (of course every job has busy seasons), and on the whole, I'd say work-life balance is a huge priority. I feel at home here. \r\n\r\nAnother plus- at Linkshare, you can pretty much build your own job. If you decide you want to do something, and you pitch it to management, they will likely tell you to go for it. They will pay you to do it, and they'll support you along the way (as long as its actually something the company does of course). I know several people here who came up with great ideas, and now head up their own departments. Of course, they put in their time at the company (this didnt happen for them in one year) but they are definitely benefiting.", "cons": "On the downside, there are some drawbacks. It's hard to grow at Linkshare if you have certain types of jobs. The company will often hire people from outside rather than promoting from within, which can be frustrating. I have seen people promoted from within, but I have also seen them hire from outside. I know company employees get very frustrated about that.\r\n\r\nAnother downside is the holiday schedule. Linkshare's busiest time of year is the holiday season- so don't expect to be \"off\" for christmas. Even though you are technically not in the office, your client can and will call you at any given time. That would be another hard thing about working at LInkshare. The point of our job is to please our clients, and its often difficult. Clients can be demanding (in any job) and they aren't very nice. I do feel defended by my bosses, but sometimes you just get caught in the line of fire. On those days, its hard to work here.\r\n\r\nAnother downside- it seems that there arent too many company-wide standards at linkshare. All departments run differently, so some departments may be benefiting in ways that others aren't. For example, in my department working from home is frowned upon. In other departments, employees work from home 3-4 days per week. It's really all dependant on your supervisor and his/her style. But it can be frustrating to watch others enjoy these perks, while you're not able to."}, {"review_title": "Nice place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Bangalore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Awesome work life balance\r\n- Current Management is very responsive to the employee queries and problems\r\n- Facilities are good (Free lunch, transport allowance(public, ola ...) ... \r\n- Lots of employee engagement (Games,Hackathons ...)\r\n- Decent pay/hike", "cons": "- Food is not good enough\r\n- More a Japanese culture oriented company, slow development processes."}, {"review_title": "Great potential, but lack of middle Management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of interesting project. \nEmployees are free to request for internal transfer.\nDiverse culture", "cons": "I\u2019ve seen lots of managers are lack of management skills. \nOften your experience doesn\u2019t reflect in your pay grade.\n\n- Low salary compare to others global company\n- Free food but not so healthy and not tasty. \n- not much employee benefits \n- if you work hard, you get more task, not bonus. \n\u2014 fitness CENTER not free, \n\u2014 child care service; it\u2019s almost impossible to have your kids enrolled to that service and it\u2019s not free\n\u2014 Career plan for employees?

Technically speaking, the management style and workflow are terrible. Teams within departments are segregated (japanese vs foreigner) and assigned responsibilities haphazardly. As a software engineer, you'll absolutely want to tear your own hair out at least twice a week. By default frontend engineers, backend engineers, product managers, and designers (which, instead of handling UI & UX, are split, into a UI team and a UX team, for god knows why) are physically separated from each other and not allowed many, if any, open channels of communication (after months of protesting we were able to convince them to allow us to \"test\" a cross functional team with our project, but we still aren't allowed complete contact with PDMs and Designers.) This means that you will be blocked at more than you will be working, and that you will find yourself re doing the work you've done at least twice due to a lack of communication. Due to this flawed structure, no one knows what the hell is going on within a project either\u2014which is by design. Most roles are so divided and micromanaged, so as not to give too much responsibility to any given person, particularly developers, as it is a \"security risk.\" The management system rivals the DMV in terms of bureaucratic prowess, and may be the most racist/sexist system of leadership I've seen since I binged watched mad men. As a developer, the majority of the coworkers on your level will be foreigners, and they will be brilliant, open-minded, kind people. The majority of your manager's, and their manager's, and their manager's manager's, and their manager's manager's manager's (yes it goes up this far and more....all in one department) will be Japanese, and are the all powerful driving force behind this inefficient excuse of a bureaucratic nightmare. They will block you at every turn, feed you misleading information, pretend to understand your english, pretend you don't understand japanese, pretty much anything you can think of that could impede progress on a project. This is also where alot of the racism and sexism comes in. Despite boasting a desire to become a \"global company\", managers will passively (and sometimes actively) harass foreign employees if they don't act in accordance with the company's work culture (which to be fair, is ailed mostly to the same extent as general Japanese corporate work culture, but Rakuten is a global tech company and supposed to be different? right?) Harassment that I've witnessed includes, but is not limited to, rumor spreading, changing hours, not approving recorded work hours and forcing PTO usage, docking pay, \"ganging up\" on people in meetings, micromanaging, sexual harassment, religious discrimination, not respecting religious holidays (against company policy), docked pay, docked bonuses, refusing department change request, rejecting promotions after years of work, rejecting pay raises after years of work, bad talking employees, physically hovering over people doing work, assigning out-of-scope work, and the list goes on. On top of all this, the pay is subpar (starting at a rough equivalent of $35,000 a year before tax for a software engineer), the pay raises for foreigners can be none existent, there is a stupid, pyramid-scheme-esque ranking system that is tied to available job roles and salary amount, that literally (though they try to deny this) is based on the amount of years you have been at the company.  The benefits are....ha, what benefits? You aren't even awarded sick days, if you do happen to come down with something that they won't allow you in the office with (like the flu), well, say goodbye to the few PTO days you have (11 by the way, you get 11 for the year) because they will make you use them. And no, yo can't just do that work from home, even though you and your work laptop are fully capable of doing just that, it isn't allowed. Neither are flex hours, making up for late time by staying late (because you're just expected to stay late :) ) or any of your typical software engineer amenities honestly. Also, they treat the CEO Hiroshi like some sort of god, it's really creepy. Like I'm so serious it reminds me of some cult from the 80s or something. And he honestly isn't that smart of impressive. CEOs like Zuckerberg and Gates, they're not only technically savvy but also know how to be creative and get a feel for how their entire company is operating. I don't think Hiroshi could write a line of code anymore, and he either has no idea what's happening within his company, or he's lying with a smile on his face every time he speaks about how \"progressive\" Rakuten is.

If you go during peak hours (12:15-12:45), it'll take you a good 10 minutes to get your food and another 10 minutes to find a seat. I should mention that Rakuten is so stingy when it comes to electricity bills that the cafeteria is barely air conditioned. \r\n-Low pay. Your monthly pretax salary is 300,000 yen. 300,000 yen x 12months = 3.6 million yen. With the current exchange rate of 120yen=1USD, we're looking at about $30,000/year. I should mention this is pretax, so post-tax, it'll come down to around $25,000. With living and social costs in Tokyo so high, you'll barely be saving. It's disheartening to see Ivy League and Stanford grads making less than what a HS janitor would make back in the US. Rakuten also does not have any retirement funds, so all our friends back in the US and Europe who have a head start on their 401k's will have a lot, LOT more money than you guys in retirement when you return to your respective country. I should also mention that the two bonuses for your first year, at least for the Ichiba department, will be 140,000yen, or about 100,000yen post-tax each, regardless of performance.\r\n-Going off on the previous topic, possibility for a pay raise is nonexistent. Second year, your monthly salary increases to a measly 310,000yen, and it'll take another 4-5 years until it bumps up to 370,000yen. Assuming you enter at 23, you'll be nearing 30 and your salary will still be at $37,000. \r\n-Long hours. I understand that overtime is a necessary evil. In any industry, there are busy seasons which necessitate crunch time. However, at Rakuten Ichiba, at least for the MDD (client acquisition teams) and the ECC teams (account management teams), overtime is expected. It varies by department, but it's extremely difficult to leave work before 7:30p. Your Japanese colleagues will oftentimes stay till 10:00p. For no damn reason. They pretend to do work, but they go on frequent unproductive smoke breaks, chat amongst each other, spend hours making powerpoint presentations that only take about 30 seconds to present, etc. If you're going into a sales role at Rakuten, make sure you establish the \"I'm going to leave at 6pm no matter what\" persona early on. Your team will guilt-trip the hell out of you, though.\r\n-Abundance of meaningless tasks and KPIs. If you're an English native, there's a good chance that you'll be translating documents for your Japanese boss. If there's a Rakuten Eagles baseball game coming up, your boss will coerce you into buying 5 tickets out of your pocket. If you're in MDD, you'll have a KPI of making 80-100 phone calls a day. If you're an ECC, you'll be pressured to sell tens of thousands of dollars worth of Ichiba advertisements to your merchants. I should mention that ECC's aren't allowed to provide analytical feedback of the effectiveness of the ads - only vague comments like \"it was good\" \"it was okay\" \"it didn't work.\" \r\n-Low retention rate. 30% of your douki's will quit in the first year. Another 40-50% will likely leave by the end of the second year. This company is not the best at retaining talent because it doesn't take too long for employees to realize that there are better companies out there for foreigners in Tokyo that pay double, even triple the salary (Google, Amazon, Criteo). \r\n-Narrow minded management. The CEO claims Rakuten to be a global company, but 95% of management in Ichiba, the largest department in the company, does not speak a lick of English and have no clue what to do with the foreign new hires.\r\n-Incompetent HR. HR is aware of prevalent issues like sexual harassment, forced overtime, low retention rate, etc, but do absolutely nothing to address the issue. They host seemingly meaningless interviews with employees but provide no feedback whatsoever."}, {"review_title": "Account manager (Affiliates UK)", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Account Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best things are for sure the immediate collegues.

Well there are so many, but to start with the most important thing is that the senior managers are not people persons. They are more like robots running on automatic pilot, I'm sure they do their own work just fine. However in terms of actual team management they perform rather poorly. There's also lack of transparency and openness. The reason why this matters so much is because most of the AM's in the full client services team are overworked and stressed out. I've found collegues crying in the office because of the heavy workload more than once. There are too many accounts given to the AM's, many compulsory but pointless, time consuming meetings and basically Sr. management literally says things like: 'Well you'll just have to deal with it, as it will only get worse' and then completely ignore the issues raised by the AM. They don't come with solutions. Encouragement and motivation are non-existent. Most AM's are 'scared' to take their full 1 hour lunch break, so what happens is that lunch is eaten every day behind the desk while working. Not only is that unhealthy and mind-numbing, it's unpaid hours you put in. Day in, day out. Not to speak about the collegues who put extra hours in by coming in every morning at 8 or leave an hour or two later in the evening several times a week. Which is by the way expected by the management, but they dont show any form of appreciation. And no, you won't get paid for this either. Which is fine if you have the occasional busy period, however this behaviour is ongoing, whatever the time of the year. It shouldn't be a big surprise Rakuten UK is not able to retain their staff.

If you studied marketing, I hope you also like public policy because that is what you'll be doing. Oh, I see you have an MBA from a top-tier school, how about I pair you off with a mentor who don't have a fraction of your professional background and invite you to meetings that are completely in Japanese even though you cannot speak Japanese and thought the company was \"Englishnized\". And isn't it a good idea to place a foreigner who has never lived in Japan before to be in charge of creating domestic marketing campaigns for Japanese people. I'm sure that doesn't hurt productivity and efficiency at all. \r\n(These are all true stories by the way.)\r\n\r\n2) The company fails to get to the root of the high attrition problem and resolve their employee's dissatisfaction. Instead, the company aims to cover up their shortcomings all the while shoving it in our faces of how lucky we are to be there. Rakuten is looking to become a global company, but a global company is not a company where you're forcing your Japanese staff to get a certain score on an English Standardized Test and threatening them with demotion and pay deduction. A global company is not one where you recruit students from top schools throughout the world to prove that x% of your workforce is non-Japanese while failing to assist them to assimilate into a completely different work culture and country. A global company should offer training for not only managers but all employees on how to work with somebody from a different background than you.

Management are generally all sycophants of Mikitani's cult and have long tenure at Rakuten.\r\n\r\n- Insanely conservative and cult-like corporate policies that are pervasive in your everyday work. Monday mornings you'll have the privilege of coming to work an hour early to attend what is essentially a Rakuten political rally and get a 15 minute speech from Mikitani himself.

The company proudly proclaims themselves a \u201cGlobal\u201d company by doing the following:\r\n\r\n- Buying Foreign Companies like Kobo, Viki, Viber, Slice, Ebates\r\n- Hiring a diverse workforce from different countries\r\n- Making English the \u201cofficial\u201d language of the company\r\n\r\nBut the culture of Rakuten itself is Japanese through and through. Your work life in Rakuten will depend on which department you will be placed in. If you are not in a front-facing product, I believe you have the better deal. But if you are part of the core service and all your upper management are Japanese, then you will probably have the some, but not limited to the following experiences:\r\n\r\n- Questions on why you or any of your team are not at your desk by 9am and asking to come to work at 9:15 was not acceptable. You will be ask to do support and monitoring during big events or be on-call for support on <insert some scenario here>. You will be questioned of every new technology or improvement you place in the system because they don't want you to break anything. \r\n\r\n- When you make a mistake, it is announced to every stakeholder, and I do mean every. This is the kind of fail-shaming culture they promote.  You need to report every minutiae of what caused precious GMS loss as they breathe down your neck asking when can you fix it or have you fixed it already and how can you never commit the same mistake, again. There are more people announcing problems left and right than people fixing it because there are more non-technical people  who can only look at things from a visual perspective and sends an update to the manager and they can go on with their day while the development team fixes it. And when you do fix it, there is no appreciation from the people who reported because I guess, it is our job.\r\n\r\n- These Non-technical people also decide on the implementation/validity of a product and the approval to release a product version. They have no understanding of features that improve the application itself because it does not relate to GMS. Development teams are treated like factory workers and are being closely monitored (Apparently, we cannot be idle). I am still somewhat grateful that my team still has the opportunity to do technical improvements, but with product management constantly asking to do small, mundane things for them because they don\u2019t know how to do so ruins the safety net of each iteration. They don\u2019t really respect the planned iteration itself. When we asked a few months ago for data regarding the features we delivered having any value, we are still waiting until now for the answer.\r\n\r\n- When the development teams finish a feature, another team goes up and presents it like they did it  because they thought of the idea, without mention of the team who did the actual implementation.  \r\n\r\n- Because of the constant flow of requirements, there is no chance to learn something new. Each meeting with management just consists of project status reports. There is no discussion on how to care for the people/ how to build their careers / how to improve process. Just the business-as-usual questions of why this X is not done or why did Y break or when is Z going to be finished. If you do not know the answer those questions, you will most likely be shamed and ridiculed for not knowing enough.\r\n\r\n-  Management style is strongly 1.0. I was lucky to have a previous manager  that gave me evaluation feedback and do constant 1 on 1s, but now I just get a rating number without a comment.  There were employee engagement surveys done since 2016 but planned action items are to be done within the next 2 years. I don\u2019t know if I will stay here long enough to see it. \r\n\r\n- You can try to fight the process and strive for change, but you can only do so much from being at the bottom level.  There are too many hoops to jump through that you eventually get burnt out and say, is this even worth it?

They say they have other products but they honestly have Affiliate and a poor Display product because their Attribution doesn't really exist.\r\n- They are placing people in positions for jobs they know nothing about but expect the staff, who have been there for years,  to train them on how to do the job \r\n- Tony Zito, CEO , loves to talk about himself but never gives any direction\r\n-Stuart Simms, President, has no real direction and is literally making it up as he goes along by using a book.

E.g. the definition of success changes making difficult to know what is delivable, success, failure, and direction of the project\n- They promote people based on stereotypes or friendship. This is what makes good workers to quit. I saw one engineer who was unhappy with the company working in his own application (for his 2nd job)  during the work and doing bad design (knowing that is bad design) for the company and  destroyed entire project. Since the managers does not understand technical things, he blames the team members and promoted this engineer to manager without knowing that the cause of project failure was this bad engineer. They prometed because he had good reputation before join this team. Result, everyone quit the company.\n- They pay highest salary just because the new graduate has MBA. I think it is ok to accelerate the career path for those who shows good results. But, i saw several cases that in 2 years they did not done anything at all. This is a extension of employee evaluation process + bad directors\n/managers.\n-  For some reason, bullies are promoted and honest employee get more responsibility without promotion. I saw one team leader who just read emails all the day, does not accept responsibility, always blame his team for failure, manipulates the truth in his benefit, and bully getting promoted to manager. I saw honest people with their career and reputation destroyed by them.\n- Most of projects does not complete because all key person left the company.

Many have turned into some of my best friends. \r\nBenefits (especially health insurance) are phenomenal \r\nMonday breakfasts, Wednesday & Friday lunches\r\nNice office location", "cons": "God grief, where do I start? Extremely top heavy organization with TONS of churn (employees and clients). Here are a few of the top reasons you won't want to touch this company with a 10 foot stick, especially if you're in sales. \r\n\r\n1. Rakuten Marketing (RM) has the worst client attrition of any company I've ever worked for. You'll be told that it's more a product of the industry or the way you're selling your deals (sales is always blamed) but rarely will you hear upper management, or the Customer Success/Optimization teams take responsibility for the amount of clients they lose. Be prepared to work 6 months to close a deal, another 3 months to launch the campaign, another 60 days after it launches to actually get paid...only to have the client give you the middle finger and leave for a competitor just as you're commission starts building.\r\n\r\n2. Speaking of compensation, the new comp plan released this year (yep, it changes annually) requires a PHD to understand. When RM has to purchase a 3rd party Salesforce software to calculate your commissions and how you're pacing on your quota, and that software ends up not being able to actually work with all the contingencies and exceptions written into the plan, its a good sign the plan is designed to fail. This is the third compensation plan I've had since starting at RM, every single plan has taken money out of my pocket or made it more difficult to make money. \r\n\r\n3. Furthermore, comp plans at RM are just pipe dreams and everyone knows it. OTE's and \"realistic earnings\" at RM are just fancy dreams thrown around that don't actually carry any weight. You'll need to take them with a grain of salt and understand they are BEST CASE SCENARIO. Unfortunately, the norm at RM is WORST CASE SCENARIO. This CS rep drops the ball here, that media buyer drives margins into the ground there, this client doesn't believe our reporting, that client can't get tags installed, on and on and on. The amount of variables that play into your pay AFTER you do your job selling a deal is mind boggling and straight up crippling to your earning potential.\r\n\r\n4. Perhaps the most insulting part of your experience at RM will be the mysterious \"law\" that upper management and HR cooked up that requires you to clock in/out. On top of this cumbersome and insulting policy will be the instability in pay period hours, salary check amounts, pay dates, HR systems, etc. Your salary should be the most stable part of your job, a set amount of money paid out on a set group of dates to cover very fixed personal expenses. When your employer starts messing with this as often and in such frustrating ways as RM, it causes serious issues (finance issues, morale issues, etc). You will, for all intents and purposes, be an hourly employee at RM. Chances are you'll feel the same way as I did: I worked too hard and accomplished too much in my career for my company to levy such a petty and disrespectful policy simply because upper management doesn't trust the sales team. \r\n\r\n5. Between how independently and selfishly each department operates, and with how many companies RM has acquired, you'll find RM employees to be extremely uncooperative outside of the immediate department they work in. To the point where it was impossible to complete mundane tasks without facing immense and stifling opposition. It has been the greatest mystery of my professional career that personalities as angry, impatient, selfish, greedy, hostile, unfriendly, antagonistic, and intimidating actually exist and thrive in RM's culture (mostly on the Media Buying, Ad-ops, and CS team). I can't count the amount of times I was belittled, disrespected, or blacklisted by an entire team if I came across as new, needy, inexperienced, or if I sold a deal that wasn't do-it-in-your-sleep easy to fulfill. And I was a top performer, imagine how the struggling AE's are treated. Most of the companies I've worked for reprimanded these personalities and in many cases let them go. At RM, they're rewarded and promoted. \r\n\r\n6. Putting personalities aside, you'll find very few clients who actually feel like the level of service, knowledge, and skill from their client team is up to par. Each team has their own metrics they care about, and aligning those metrics with the client\u2019s expectations isn\u2019t a thought that seems to cross anyone\u2019s mind at RM. As a sales person, if you care at all about your commission or saving face with your clients you'll have to essentially manage every part of the post-sales process (which isn't actually in your job description). From Account Managers playing video games during client kick-off calls to Media Buyers straight up forgetting to launch campaigns and using questionable (read: dishonest) buying methods, it\u2019s considered just plain stupid on the sales team to not manage every step of every process of every one of your clients, even far beyond where the sales job should be (and technically is by a job description) finished. \r\n\r\n7. Last but certainly not least, it is common knowledge and a shared sentiment among the sales team that upper management does not have your back. In fact, the relationship sales has with most departments/teams at RM and especially upper management is contentious at best. Its a hostile environment when sales' budget rolls up to a GM who seems to be bent on ridding his company of any decent sales talent."}], [{"review_title": "Terrible management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Jan 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Berlin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some of the best professionals that I worked so far.

It's common practice for execs to have a designated room but not common practice for said exec to walk right in the middle of a meeting to kick everyone out because he needs the room. Very rude and annoying because conference rooms were often booked making it already difficult without having rooms reserved for execs that stayed empty for the whole day.\r\n\r\n- Rumors of inappropriate work behavior. Not sure if it\u2019s a cultural difference but could be misconstrued as harassment. \r\n\r\n- Inability to understand Silicon Valley culture. Rakuten is very top-down when the majority of the Valley is collaborative/flat. If you've ever watched Office Space, you have a good idea of what it's like to work at Rakuten.\r\n\r\n- Transportation is limited. You pretty much need a car to get to the office. Hayward Park Caltrain is 11 mins away walking but is not a main station so you have to take the Local. If you live in the East Bay, you'll need a car to get to the office since they no longer have shuttles.\r\n\r\n- Periodically will run out of food because they want to cut costs. This looks bad when you invite clients to onsite meetings.\r\n\r\n- No coherent company vision. Mikitani acquires companies based on how much he likes the CEO not based on whether the company can actually drive revenue for the overall business. This results in a bunch of incongruent companies that have no vision to shoot for and no goal to work toward."}, {"review_title": "Difficult to communicate and constant HR interference", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Data Engineer in Tokyo", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free food for 3 meals per day (you have to arrive early and leave late for breakfast and dinner).", "cons": "HR is bad; Miscommunication is common in the company; Most people do not know what to do; Work space is noisy; Many random meetings and distraction during a workday; Asakai (Monday morning all-company meeting) is mandatory for promotion."}, {"review_title": "Good company, but a lot of cons...", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Apr 2020", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good culture.

It's very clear with the 'glowing' reviews below that I don't need to add mine. But, I feel that I must warn people, because I don't want anyone else to suffer the hell that I went through.\r\n\r\nI can't even express in words how disorganised and demotivating Rakuten Marketing UK is. Nothing at this company made sense and by no exaggeration, the majority of employees are depressed, hence the extremely high turnover. In 2014, 8 Account Managers left the company (in a company of approx 60 people). I'll go through some of reasons why:\r\n\r\n1. An Account Manager will be introduced to their role, without any professional training. When something goes wrong, the Account Manager will be blamed when management never told them the correct procedure in the first place. The director will give you 8-11 clients to manage but will not give you a tutorial on how to use the dashboard, how to read a trend card, what to put in the agenda, what to communicate with your client, how to create a feed, how to check the feed, what tasks to give the Coordinators (who are also swamped) and how to create an account review. There is no structure. You learn from your peers, unfortunately your peers are so overworked with calls, emails, meetings that they do not have the time help others. I love helping people, but when you can't even breathe, you can't help others.\r\n\r\n2. The management aren't trained to manage people. I never felt that any of the managers made you feel empowered and in control of your own work. I felt like I wasn't trusted and I was always micro-managed even though I worked as hard as I could when being overworked. A poor director will give poor advice to their managers and then will give poor advice to employees.\r\n\r\n3. The Account Manager has to attend so many meetings, all day, they do not have time to check their emails to answer their client, and then the client complains. Sure, you could get another Account Manager to cover you, but guess what? There are not enough Account Managers to cover all of the accounts. Let me go through how many meetings a week: all company meeting, UK team meeting, client services meeting, publisher spotlight x 2-3, day in the life of a publisher, account reviews (8-11 dependent on how many clients you have), catch ups, events, random pointless client meetings when the senior manager wants to show that they are doing some work for a promotion. We wanted to help our clients, but we didn't physically (and eventually emotionally) have the capacity to support them.\r\n\r\n4. The managing director, he's a very nice guy personally. Unfortunately, he's more of Ted Talks motivational speaker than a manager. He will talk about 'amazing things and endless possibilities', but none of these will be actioned in reality. He's all about the budget for the short term, not the long term.\r\n\r\n5. Lack of professionalism and procedures, there's no real complaints procedure, there's no pension scheme, no maternity benefits package. This company is all about the term 'budget'. And don't get me started on the unfair compensation and the career progression for promotions/salaries. \r\n\r\nSave yourself.
