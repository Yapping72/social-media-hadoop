Few things to highlights in the technology side: 1) If you're unlucky, you\u2019ll get an old-timer manager who micromanaging a lot and scrutinizes unnecessarily instead of growing the team. 2) Always ask for process improvement including presentation of how other banks (if you\u2019re from another) do things but never accept different perspective. Almost waste of time presenting. 3) They do catch up to other banks like DBS in terms of customer facing applications but lack of centralize systems for internal use. Very behind that of DBS and still using excel like a database. Excel is only as updated as someone willing to update it not a live info. 4) Brought in new technologies to play catch up but always stuck in one or two team because every team is so silo and there\u2019s a lack of direction to cascade to every division. 5) A lot of old timers who doesn\u2019t understand the importance of collaboration between teams. Full of back-stabbing instead. 6) A lot of long working hours in various teams can be reduced significantly if automation is in place. The problem is many people lack exposure on how things are automated in more advance banks, and they think that they must work this long to complete it. 7) Some old managers so call \u201cknow-it-all\u201d mindset is actually \u201cknow nothing\u201d in European/US banks or even DBS. These people doesn\u2019t even have a Linkedin profile or understand how the modern management works.
