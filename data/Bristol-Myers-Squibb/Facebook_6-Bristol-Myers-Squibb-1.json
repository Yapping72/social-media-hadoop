And most of upper management is just trying to deal with change and keep their own careers and power structures.

Management does not involve employees when enacting changes, nor does management listen to the concerns and improvement suggestions of employees. Where supervisors/managers by all rights ought to be developing their employees and providing them what's needed to succeed in their roles, those responsibilities are shirked back onto employees themselves, usually without clear direction or supervision. For this reason it can take weeks to gain badge access to your area, and months to get your training \"plan\" accurate.\n\nFull time jobs seem to be a thing of the past, so if you were hoping for benefits, keep looking. BMS only seems to bring on contract employees, and treats them like objects, at that.  This is regardless of your experience, education, or expertise. In all cases but 1 that I've witnessed in my time here so far, an employee whose contract is about to expire receives NO INFORMATION from BMS nor the contract agency as to future intentions. The most anyone has gotten is lip service and brushed aside. Come the fateful day, the response it's always a surprise. In one case, the poor employee was not told until the last day that he should probably look for a new job.\n\nAnother was extended 6 months, on the last day; he was vocal about his needs for decent healthcare as he required medication, nearing the end of his career. He was a bit slow to learn the computerized systems, but was surely picking it up over the months. No matter, apparently... He was let go last week for reasons that dismay the team.\n\nOn the same day last week, another older gent was let go. He had just had his contract extended another 6 months. He was told in passing by someone other than his supervisor. Fast forward two weeks, and he's being let go for something that happened in December. Why string him along like that, with not even the respect to communicate with him?\n\nIf you're looking for a REAL job, I highly suggest looking elsewhere."}, {"review_title": "Great company: weak future", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Dec 2008", "job_title": "Territory Manager in Lafayette, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent overall work environment from management, benefits, work-life balance, and morale.
