The other training is not as knowledgeable, a little condescending with a bit of an attitude. Training is for 4 weeks, schedule is 9 - 6. You cannot take paper onto the floor so notes must be written in Notepad.\r\nOnce on the floor, you will be under a team lead who has never taken a phone call in their life, they will 'help you' by walking up to you and giving you their idea of what needs to happen and walk away.

Whether to prioritize issue A, or issue B it's actually up to me. Now I'm not making choices like buying companies, or where to create the next datacenter, but... I can decide that working on the maps will increase conversion and create a whole heap of new features about maps and work on them. I just have never had that level of autonomy at another company. \r\n\r\nThailand:\r\n\r\nLiving in Thailand is awesome. I cannot begin to compare it to my life in London.

Agoda tests so much. Every line of code we have tests for. Unit tests, javascript tests, system tests, database tests, api tests. Honestly - I don't enjoy testing.

There are 3 teams currently.\r\nOne TM is oblivious to the job itself and leans on other agents for help. One TM called in an agent on their day off and offered to pay them overtime because they were so frazzled. The same TM called another agent while they were out getting their hair done and asked if they could have their phone on if they needed additional help. This is a call center not an EMT position, there is no need to have someone on call because a TM cant do their job.\r\nOne TM is newer and seems to have a great team dynamic. Although this TM cannot assist with alot, they are eager to learn.\r\nOne TM is brutally honest and has a smart mouth as well as a sense of humor. This TM is a bit removed and is not as personable as they should be with their teams agents.\r\n\r\nNot that long ago, the payroll in Bangkok overpaid the floor $10K and the agents that were overpaid had $100 deducted out of their check until the company was repaid. Many agents who worked overtime from May - July didnt have their overtime paid on time and it was more than a headache since the payments were late, some were a month late. After this illegal practice from the company, the site leader informed us that this wouldnt happen again so were waiting to see how the future of payroll is being rolled out.

I don't know what figure makes it OK to be constantly embarrassed on the front line with angry screaming hotels but what Agoda offers it's just not enough. \r\n\r\nAgoda try to come across as a company where you can deepen your skills and \u2018grow\u2019 (whatever that means). Chances are that the moment you join you will already know far more about the market, job and the industry than your manager. All the reporting, analysis or tools are developed by entry level people and it\u2019s disguised under \u2018coaching so that you can grow\u2019. Put any of the managers in front of the system and ask them to do any of the above and they just won\u2019t be able to. Even training for new starters is entirely conducted by people in \u2018normal\u2019 positions as the management simply don\u2019t know. They won\u2019t help you with difficult hotel conversations or meetings but will quite happily jump in when a big deal is about to be struck. \r\n\r\nOn a positive side however, most of them are nice and often a good laugh to have around. Still, it\u2019s unforgivable that they managed to ruin what once was a great environment. \r\n\r\nSo if you need a job, this is a job. But if you have a choice, go for the \u2018other\u2019 one."}, {"review_title": "Great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Bangkok", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of opportunities to embrace new projects and try new things.

If you fit that profile, enjoy.
