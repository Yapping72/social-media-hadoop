Vast majority of agents do not stay beyond 2 to 3 years, those who can stay 1 year and longer are considered seniors. Most leave in a matter of weeks or months, you see people come and go all the time. People leave due to high work stress (not easy to meet the kpi and multitasking, work processes are also tedious and everchanging) and on top of that still need to deal with people issues aka office politics. In other call centers you see people staying for decades.\n\nNot much leeway for keen new agents who are late bloomers or need more time to cope with the steep learning curve, as it's very stats oriented. \n\nManagement critical of agents but don't apply the same level of standards to themselves.

Personal Development - I have been able to take control of my career and focus on my development along with the support of my manager. I was actually able to create my current role when I saw there was a need, I really like it that this type of behavior is encouraged here, there is a sense of constantly trying to improve and if you have good ideas shout about them (that could be the next project you work on). Training- I've had the opportunity to go to management training and cross- training in other offices. Culture- the people are awesome, we are encouraged to collaborate and share best practices amongst  our team. I love how everyone gets to contribute no matter what your level you have a voice here!", "cons": "Change is constant- if you're a creature of habit and routine, the constantly changing business can be frustrating. Fast paced environment- it can be difficult to keep up if you're not used to it. Keeps you on your toes. A bit unstructured (fiercely anti-bureaucratic),  makes for a refreshing change for me - I have seen people struggle however if they are not used to such a company. If you like to be told what to do, and need structure you probably wont like it here much."}, {"review_title": "Thanks People", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "21 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Team Manager in Kuala Lumpur", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Plenty of Career advancement and opportunity of learning.
