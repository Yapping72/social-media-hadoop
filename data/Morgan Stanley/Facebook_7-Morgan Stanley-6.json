Overall good place to \"settle down\" with if you don't mind typical corporate politics and the faceless corporate agenda that will always put shareholders before employees.", "cons": "Salaries are below market price.  Compensation is based on a \"Total Compensation\" concept which is Base + Cash Bonus = Total Comp.  In practice this means that your Base is at or below market price with the promise of a cash bonus at year end.  HR plays percentage games because Total Comp has caps for each level.  Typically, Base grows at the expense of Bonus and total comp can stay flat for 3-5 years depending on market and on personal career trajectory.  Although bumps typically happen following a promotion, this is not always the case.  \r\n\r\nOdds are that the Firm is re-aligning earning expectations.  The Big Bonus lure is a thing of the past.  Those who can survive the 17-30% total comp loss as a result of this years shift can only hope for a base bump to market price in 2012.  But Total Comp will not recover and you will not get \"back on track\".  If you're in it, write this and next few years off as a loss.  \r\n\r\nCulture at the Firm is still that of late 90s boom.  People are expected to work hard/long hours.  Now that rewards structure is diminished, there is a conflict between cultural expectations and actual rewards.  This will take a few years to stabilize. \r\n\r\nHR will not adjust base salaries mid year unless the exodus of talent is severe enough to cause internal hemorrhaging.  Given churn in the market, odds of a favorable outcome for employees are low.   \r\n\r\nMore on promotions.  These are typically veiled in secrecy and management delivers an inconsistent message.  Advice for incomers: discuss promotion process and your candidacy openly with your manager.  If your manager will not have the conversation with you openly it means that she is not looking out for your career.  Consider moving on.   Further, promotions are retroactive.  Increase in responsibilities, higher profile projects, management responsibilities typically occur 1 or 2 years before your manager will \"put you up\". HR defines a quota for promotions.  You manager will compete against other managers for a spot.  Criteria for a successful submission includes a demonstrable successful track record of delivery, mentorship, technical excellence, citizenship, etc.  This is why promotions are typically a 1-3 year process from the moment that you and your manager agree that this is a year for you to be \"put up\".

Co-workers were realistic about the good and bad of the systems they were in charge of, and always seemed open to discussions about new approaches to improving them (and often acting on those discussions). This collegial aspect was reflected through the organization, with management setting the tone for those below them to follow. I generally found most people easy to work with.\r\n\r\nThere's lots of smart people in Morgan IT, both from a business as well as a technology perspective.\r\n\r\nMorgan has evolved a substantial capability for remote work, and many managers are comfortable with people working from home on a regular basis (and they do it themselves). For the parts of the organization I'm familiar with, I would say that Morgan has less stress on perpetually working long hours that other places have. In general, I found work-life balance good, hampered the most through their inconvenient location in Canary Wharf, which often entails miserable commutes.\r\n\r\nPromotions are available but aren't handed out willy-nilly. ED level promotions are taken quite seriously and a lot of review by a lot of people takes place. This results in getting pretty good people in senior roles.\r\n\r\nOne thing I really appreciated was the fact that Morgan has such a good culture but doesn't go around broadcasting it as a selling point. I've come to learn that the organizations that talk the most about how good their culture is often have lots of unattractive aspects to hide, but Morgan doesn't talk about it's own culture much at all-- they simply walk the walk. I'm starting to be convinced that this is a hallmark of a truly good culture.\r\n\r\nAlthough some complain about it, I found Morgan's internal automation of IT to be pretty impressive. Most of the time software can be delivered with minimal fuss", "cons": "Morgan is resource constrained, and IT finds much of its budget devoted to things it has to do rather than things that it feels are new and important to do, either for itself or for the business. Thus, new and interesting work, although available, isn't always easy to get involved with, so if that's important you may want to bear that in mind.\r\n\r\nMorgan also has some fairly old systems that it has to live with due to the point above; some are better than others, although many are surprisingly robust and handle significant volumes on a daily basis. There's strategic work to lay the foundation for changing many of those, but that's going to take a good amount of time to achieve.\r\n\r\nSome people complain that there's too much consensus building, and that it takes too long to reach decisions. I've heard stories about how people thought that a decision was reached, but when someone discovered they had been left out, the entire decision was scuttled and had to be discussed all over again. I never witnessed that specifically, and making significant decisions doesn't seem any more fraught than in any other big bank, but I have had that communicated to me by multiple people there.\r\n\r\nWhile the rigorous promotion process yields quality results, Morgan is frugal with promotions, and there's a fair amount of competition, so if moving up rapidly in IT is important, you should bear this in mind.\r\n\r\nAs with other banks, Morgan pays above average for IT as a whole, but bonuses have suffered in recent years. Some MDs have told me their view is that since the days of big profits are probably not coming back, Morgan may be constrained structurally in how good bonuses will get.\r\n\r\nMorgan's location strategy is to focus on building IT capacity in non-major metro areas, which includes Glasgow, Montreal, Budapest, and Shanghai. Often this leads management to conclude that London is ideally situated as it has significant time overlaps with all of these locations. If you're happy to spend the majority of your day on the phone in meetings with remote workers as they overlap with the UK business day, then this will be heaven for you, but if you want to actually get work done, the amount of communication you need to perform will be challenging to say the least.\r\n\r\nMorgan uses a quintilling process (forced ranking) as part of the review cycle, and there's just too much evidence that this is actually a poisonous practice for organizations. Morgan seems to have so far managed to avoid its ill effects, but be aware that a ranking distribution must be met.\r\n\r\nAs with most banks, career opportunities dwindle as you move up in the org."}, {"review_title": "Great Company, poor program structure and benefits", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Jan 2015", "job_title": "Financial Advisor Associate in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great, smart people regularly available\r\nAbundance of resources available\r\nVery flexible work hours (but as a financial advisor program that is to be expected)", "cons": "Slow processes for some very simple tasks (aka bureaucratic), but that's to be expected at any big firm really\r\n\r\nCompensation is unacceptable.
