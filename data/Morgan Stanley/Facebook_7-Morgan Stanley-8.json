Then Morgan Stanley IT might be the right place for you!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Flexible telecommuting options.\r\n- Many interesting technologies are used throughout the firm.\r\n- Despite the recent exodus, many smart and talented people remain.", "cons": "Before you accept a job in Morgan Stanley's IT department, think long and hard about whether it's the best move for you. Here are some important things to know:\r\n\r\n1. Morgan Stanley's IT department is extremely political and bureaucratic. In fact, much of your day will likely be spent dealing with non-technical minutia such as PowerPoint presentations, status reports, and status meetings. If you aren't dealing with these minutia or in the midst of a turf battle, then you're probably a very low level peon. Ironically, the low level peons are often the smartest people in Morgan's IT department.\r\n\r\n2. If you were hired through a traditional channel, such as a recruiter or the HR department, you're a nobody. Don't expect your career to go anywhere, no matter how technically proficient you are. The people who succeed at Morgan are buddies with senior management. They hang out with management at lunch or after work, and are invited over for barbecues. Can you get into this inner circle? Maybe, but this effort will require your nose to be a glorious shade of brown.\r\n\r\n3. Most managers don't care about you or your career. They just want the work done. Why? Because their compensation is a whole lot bigger than yours and their time is usually spent justifying their existence. They will not hesitate to blame you when something goes wrong. Rarely, if ever, have I seen a Morgan Stanley IT manager take responsibly for his employee's actions. To add insult to injury, many of these managers will leave the office each evening well before you do. \r\n\r\n4. If you like cupcakes, then Morgan Stanley is a great place to work. Many employees in one large IT group did not receive bonuses this year. Instead, they were presented with delicious gourmet cupcakes. Mmmmmm.\r\n\r\n5. I know of an employee who joined Morgan Stanley IT last year and was not paid his negotiated bonus. While bonuses aren't guaranteed in writing, there is an understanding on Wall Street that the negotiated bonus will be paid. Morgan Stanley violated this sacred agreement.\r\n\r\n6. Communication skills are highly valued by management, while tech skills are not. (This wasn't always the case. Ten years ago, Morgan ran a very different IT shop.) You wouldn't believe some of the mediocre talent that gets promoted, simply because they talk the talk. This is a perpetual cycle, because in many cases the managers that handle the promotions aren't great technologists, but are easily bamboozled by their fellow talkers.\r\n\r\n7. Presumably, you are at the top of your game. That's why you were hired at Morgan. But you wouldn't know it once you're on board. If you aren't part of the inner circle, you will be given all kinds of absurd reasons why you aren't promoted (e.g. you're not \"visible\" enough) and your compensation is stagnant or shrinking. You'll be spoken to like you're a child and lectured on things that are completely obvious to you. The idea is to belittle you, so that your manager can keep you in your place - just where you belong.\r\n\r\nI believe you can find much better companies to work for, where your skills and effort will be truly appreciated."}, {"review_title": "The absolute worst, Purchase runs like a warehouse, no leadership, lots of know- it-alls", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "13 Sept 2013", "job_title": "Assistant Vice President in Purchase, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Location and that's about it.", "cons": "No transparency, HR isn't knowledgeable or strategic thinkers so you're off on bad footing from day 1.

Responsibility never lies with them and they always look to blame their direct reports for anything that goes wrong. The buck never stops with them. They are also generally unknowledgeable of the day-to-day work that goes on and the systems utilized, much to their own peril and thus they speak in ignorance readily and with great arrogance. They don't understand the limitations and flaws of the outdated and primitive systems in use, and rather than find solutions, or change what is flawed, they insist that it's always been so and if it ain't broke... (yeah, it's only technically not broken, in any self-respecting organization such primitive and contrived work-arounds to outdated garbage would be considered what they are: disasters in the making)\r\nThey are also often prone to contradictory orders and statements on policy/practice/regulations.\r\n\r\nSupport from bottom-end management is entirely lacking, and politics and a vicious blame-culture are palpable on a daily basis. Direct and clear communication is almost non-existent, and the passive-aggressive office culture means that verbal communication is rare and not valid, almost everything must be put in electronic form. Just don't expect it be to be clear or explicit. Instead, get used to having to read between lines and deduce information. \r\n\r\nDo not expect any support and orientation in a new role. You will not get it. Documentation is nonexistent. Most things are taught inadequately by being shown at lightning speed once and then corrected slowly as the inevitable mistakes are made.\r\n\r\nLine managers will not grant you permission to stay later to complete work but they themselves will excuse themselves to show up late and leave early on a regular basis. This is what is called work-life balance.\r\n\r\nThe work itself across operations is for the most part tedious, monotonous, intellectually stultifying, and only difficult because of poor systems, inefficient work processes that are impervious to improvement and change, and the lack of support from management.\r\n\r\nThe organization at large is full of people at the lowest rank who have been there too long, have been beaten up and demotivated too much, and feel unappreciated and underpaid compared to the competition."}, {"review_title": "Great Experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jan 2015", "job_title": "Associate in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Morgan Stanley has a very strong market position in investment banking, which gives you substantial deal exposure.
