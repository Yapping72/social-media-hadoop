Compensation, 401k, and health benefits are also very good.  The firm also affords some people the ability to change positions (within your business and other parts of the firm).  While this is not handled as well as it is at other firms the option does exist.", "cons": "This varies from business to business but the middle to senior management of some businesses have no real management skills which can lead to stagnant careers for those people who report to them.  Communication is lacking and you often learn important pieces of information too late or after decisions have been made even though the decision affects you and you should have been consulted.  Performance reviews are viewed by too many managers as a chore that they have to perform which in many cases makes them virtually worthless.  My last performance review consisted of 5 sentences that were sloppily strung together.  This ties into the general theme of not so great management skills in the middle management group."}, {"review_title": "Financial Advisor Associate Program", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 May 2014", "job_title": "Financial Advisor Associate in Tampa, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The FAA Program is a great place to get your licenses and get the training you need to launch a financial advisory practice.
