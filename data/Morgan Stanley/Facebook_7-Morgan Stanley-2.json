Hands down.", "cons": "1) Unless you have the means to break through the doors to better, any promotions will only be to another phone role. I think another reviewer said the same. The turnover is high for the CSR/AFSR/FSR roles. My colleagues and I heard a lot in those earlier meetings with leadership about how possible it is to move up fast. In hindsight, perhaps that commentary was to keep our interest and lower those turnover rates. But, what's moving UP? Different kinds of calls. But still calls. That\u2019 not necessarily a bad thing if you\u2019re okay with heavy phone roles. This is not to minimIze the importance of anyone\u2019s position because we all want different things. Just letting you know what UP might look like. \r\n\r\n2) I agree with the reviewer who cautioned others about coming on board unless they\u2019re already dead inside. If you care about your mental health, this might not be the place for you. As someone in leadership told the group I was in soon after starting: \"This job WILL affect your mental health.\" That person has now moved on to bigger and better things. But they called it as they had seen and experienced it. As soon as it started to affect me, I began putting my departure plan together and the company, with its continued way of doing things (or rather NOT doing things) helped me make my move sooner rather than later. Read on. \r\n\r\n3) Few, excluding the trainers, cared except for those colleagues I was fortunate to meet. We tried to lift one another up until we could get out of the hell we were in. I\u2019d heard that a couple of the floor managers were really good and helpful but, assuming that's even true, I was not on those teams. I'd been trying to have conversations with the \"right\" people for months about certain challenges and most were avoidant. One person was really proactive about wanting to talk to me once I shared a little of my experience, and a little is all I was willing to share until I developed trust. That opportunity never came. The person left, and their replacement was the total opposite. They stood me up for a planned meeting, which I practically had to beg for, and evaded talking to me about my situation. Their boss was about the same. I saw them active in Slack and reached out and was flat out ignored. I resigned that very day because it was the final straw of running behind them.\r\n\r\n4) Employees' calls with their names were played for trainees and picked apart. From a respect standpoint, it's not good should you end up on a team together. \r\n\r\n5) Time off was advertised as a perk upon hire, but you weren\u2019t allowed to take it if you were on the floor - emergency or not. Or maybe it depends on your team. My experience was that if you were the first line of contact for customers, you had to work every holiday they advertised that the company was off, unless that was a regular day off for the representative. Extra pay was awarded for working, but it didn't replace family time if that was the attraction.\r\n\r\n6) Depending on your team, the leads could be condescending, rude, and impatient in Slack and verbally. Yet they were always saying \"team\" this and \"team\" that. My team manager and leads failed to create an environment of support, trust, encouragement, or building up. Instead, it was quite the contrary. It could have come from their own insecurities and not really knowing what they were doing even if they knew more than their representatives.\r\n\r\n7) The coaching on the floor was inadequate and Slack responses were poor, depending on the team. They were one word answers, yet, the representatives were expected to provide a LOT of detail on the issues placed in the team chat. Sometimes the responses were a link to a Salesforce article that was already read and made no sense - hence the reason help was sought in the first place. Sometimes I waited and waited for someone to give guidance, then went back and forth in a dialogue with leadership's one word responses, BEGGED for real explanations for what seemed like forever, and meantime customers were waiting and hold times were jeopardized. All of this was because they didn't know how to or wouldn't help. One day, my manger and lead told me they couldn't help because they were in a meeting. So I asked the second team leader for help - the one who was usually very unpleasant...or MORE unpleasant than the others because none of this team was nice. The lead claimed to be leaving. \u201cSorry, no. I\u2019m about to head out.\u201d So there I was stuck on a call with no help. This was common and happened with escalations, too. No one seemed to want to take ownership. I eventually started calling other departments to ask questions so my contact with them would be limited. \r\n\r\n8) Just because the managers and leads had been in the business a long time didn't mean they were skilled in team building and management. As an example, I received a welcome email when I got on a team and it was full of chastisement which made me feel anything BUT welcome. Finger wagging and negative language (DON'T, NOT, CAN'T, NEVER, NO and lots of exclamation points) throughout the email. It was indicative of my experience on the team.\r\n\r\n9) EVERY SINGLE MINUTE of time at work was dictated and monitored. This might come as no surprise as it's both call center and financial services culture. I felt more like a machine than a person. I suggest employees take note of how long it takes leaders to respond to questions on calls that they later blame you for taking too long to handle; if they frequently and purposefully look over your questions; and if they're being mean or punishing towards you like the team leader who was absolutely horrible to me and went out of the way to praise others to TRY to create competition and a sense of jealousy. I saw right through this and eventually found some humor in the behavior. See, no matter what was done, it still didn't make me want E*TRADE and especially not my team. I had already checked out once I started noticing the negativity."}, {"review_title": "Place is a little behind on tech", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 May 2022", "job_title": "Software Development Engineer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay for people coming in now.

Propagating the failures of the US Prison system up into Canada by corporate mandate. \r\n\r\nYou can't get a better job title or a raise there because it's impossible, but if you threaten to quit, then in less than 72 hours it's suddenly possible. You're too valuable on your team to be given a new role, but not valuable enough to be paid fairly.\r\n\r\nNo more Christmas party, because Christmas is a bad word.

The ones who stay are more or less the same kind. Most senior advisors, who have been there for decades, seem to have the same old-school Wall St mindset and work ethic (lack thereof.) The management strongly emphasizes the importance of junior advisors joining a team. Thus, for the newbies, it is their main focus in the first year to market themselves to teams. If you are young, white men, regardless of your talent or education, you probably are able to find a team of old, white men to adopt you. Once you are in, the team will abuse your contacts to the end, and you will cold call like there's no tomorrow, while learning nothing valuable that will help you become a better, smarter advisor. Did I mention that the failure rate for new advisors is known to be 98%? So, if you're not one of the 2% who survive (we are not talking about thrive here), you will be out the door within 2 years. The contacts you have brought in? They stay with the team, at MS. And, you are out prospecting again at a different company.

My co-workers were bright and highly motivated, and there was a real culture of excellence and meritocracy. Unfortunately, all that has now been overturned in the pursuit of \"equity\" and leftist box-ticking. The recruitment and promo processes are now weighted against males and white people, and as a result MS is now on a slow slide to irrelevance and oblivion.", "cons": "I worked at MS for nearly a decade. I left because of 2 main reasons :\n\n(1) short-sighted cost-cutting mentality that focusses on hitting next year's financial targets at the extent of building a skilled and motivated workforce. I got sick of hiring and training good people only to see those same people fired a year or two later. This happened repeatedly during my decade at the firm.\n\n(2) excessive pandering to left-wing \"social justice\" causes that prioritises certain demographics over others, regardless of job competency\n\nTo expand on the first point, many teams at MS are chronically understaffed. The firm has incredibly complex systems with decades of history, a huge backlog of important regulatory work - but not enough people to do it all. Rob Rooney (head of technology) made a series of deep cuts in late 2019 in a bid to hit profitability targets, which caused morale to plummet. The firm only started to hire again the start of 2021. The problem is that every single team is now in a mad bidding war and HR is struggling under the load. We're therefore forced to engage external consulting firms (aka bodyshops) in a desperate bid to get more people in before the gates close again.\n\nThere's another problem...\n\nThe location strategy. MS is pushing hard to cut costs in \"metro locations\" and hire cheap workers in India and East Europe. Many managers have been instructed not to make any more hires in London or New York. The problem is that we need people with a very specific set of skills, and those people simply don't exist in other locations (certainly not in the numbers we need). We also lack good senior managers in many of the locations that we're allowed to hire into. Quality control is becoming a serious problem. Result : an influx of new people with little finance experience, and often only passable tech skills. There are also language barriers that cause frequent confusion. \n\nThen there's also the whole \"diversity and inclusion\" agenda. You can't escape this stuff in a big org, but at MS it is out of control. MDs have been instructed to hire more females and minorities or \"there will be consequences\" (to quote from an older Rooney town-hall). The result has been a sharp decline in quality. There simply aren't enough good female engineers to go round, so what do we do to hit the target ? Lower the standards of course. I was hired after a gruelling 3 hour interview which tested my financial and IT knowledge to the limit. We're now making hires based on a thirty minute Zoom call. We're also passing over highly qualified males in a bid to hit targets. The inevitable result is a large influx of underqualified hires who are just going to drive out the few remaining talented people. \n\nThe D&I agenda carries over into the promo process too. The process goes like this : first, a panel of peers interviews the relevant stakeholders and objectively ranks the promotion candidates based on their ability and achievements. Then, the list is passed on to an MD who shuffles people around to make sure we hit all the right \"diversity\" targets (and to ensure that his/her year-end bonus doesn't get cut). Result : perfectly good people get moved down the list because they're not the right gender and/or colour. Of course, they're never told why they got passed over, since that might expose the firm to legal action. Nice.\n\nOn a related topic : shortly before I left I was repeatedly nagged to attend training courses informing me about my \"white privilege\" and I have also been subjected to regular emails about the firm's commitment to social justice issues and (shudder) \"racial equity\". I can't begin to tell you how repellent I find this brainwashing. To have an investment bank, a bastion of free-market capitalism, peddling hard-left propaganda to its staff ? Please just leave me along and let me get on with my work. Personally, I'm thoroughly sick of being subjected to divisive political propaganda while I'm trying to earn a living. The barrage of woke drivel is getting unbearable and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who's fed up with it."}, {"review_title": ".", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Financial Analyst in Budapest", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "International environment, Training opportunities, benefits", "cons": "Working hours between 9 am and 6 pm"}, {"review_title": "Experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "the working environtment was great", "cons": "the amount of daily work was too much"}, {"review_title": "Decent but could be beter", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Senior Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good team member\r\nWell organized and structured\r\nSalary is decent", "cons": "Hikes are really bad\r\nNo tech benefit"}, {"review_title": "Software Engineer at Morgan Stanley", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Full Stack Engineer in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Environment & Helpful team members", "cons": "Not so good work-life balance"}, {"review_title": "Still Growing Revenue", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Senior Finance Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent culture.
