If you want to age rapidly and develop health issues from the high stress, then be my guest.", "cons": "At Valero Energy, it\u2019s not about your skills but rather who you know. You could literally have a non-technical degree and become a refinery scheduler and go on to be a trader (met someone like this and he straight up said he got the job through connections). \r\n\r\nThere is nepotism at every corner. Most of the interns got there through connections. Whether the CFO is your uncle, you have a family friend high up in HR, or your dad manages a refinery, most of the interns got there by knowing someone. \r\n\r\nThe amount of sexism that was present was overwhelming. I felt like I was in the 1900s and I might as well be a secretary. Many of the female interns would complain about their partners stealing their ideas and presenting them as their own (happened to me too), or being cut off while talking. My male partner for the group internship did not pull his weight at all and this also happened to several other female interns. I basically did the entire project.  Could I complain about this? NO. \r\n\r\nManagement does not provide constructive criticism, but rather criticism that is subjective and not helpful in any sense. \u201cYou\u2019re too technical/analytical,\u201d \u201cwe don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll fit in\u201d\r\n\r\nMany of the jobs for newcomers are 24/7 so if you care about having work life balance then this is not the place for you. \r\n\r\nEveryone seemed on edge and fake here. They require you to attend an excessive amount of social events, and guess what? You don\u2019t get paid for them. And by require, I mean there\u2019s social pressure to attend and if you don\u2019t, you probably will not get promoted or get a job (intern). I kid you not, they wanted us to attend an event on Father\u2019s Day and then looked down at us when we did not show up. Um, hello? Some of us would rather spend Father\u2019s Day with our fathers !!! Expect several events lasting upwards 8+ hours on your days off. \r\n\r\nOn top of this, you are expected to handle issues on your own. For example, one of the interns complained to her supervisor that their partner was playing computer games instead of helping with the project. This intern happened to have an uncle who is very high up so guess who ended up getting in trouble? That\u2019s right, the person actually doing their job. \r\nAnother intern had her project completely deleted by another intern and she took this to her supervisors, again guess who got in trouble? Bingo! The person whose project was deleted. \ud83e\udd21\r\nAnother intern was sexually harassed by her partner but she did not feel comfortable going to anyone about this. You may ask why? Because the people who complained or went to management with their problems didn\u2019t get the job. \r\n\r\nWhat baffled me is that many people in upper management openly talk about how there is no such thing as global warming. Uhm, okay there is scientific evidence that states the contrary but let\u2019s just ignore all the scientists that actually went to school to study that. \r\n\r\nNo mask mandate was lifted shortly after the interns joined, mind you, this is when covid was still at its peak. I felt forced to not wear a mask because I would not \u201cfit in.\u201d Many of the interns ended up sick and had to take off. \r\n\r\nTime and attendance. Even the HR people were quite something. If you forget to clock in your time and attendance expect the reminder to get cc'ed to your boss, your boss\u2019s boss, and expect messages from practically the whole HR team. \r\n\r\nThey say there\u2019s not a ranking system but that\u2019s not true. There\u2019s not a formal ranking system but you\u2019re still ranked. \r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t mind working with bullies or are a bully yourself then this is the place for you."}, {"review_title": "Fair", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Credit Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Varies by department, but nice bonuses.", "cons": "No work from home option."}], [{"review_title": "Great company culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay and benefits.

While I have a lot of respect for our management team, it is disheartening to come to work every day and see their new Mercedes or Ferrari's parked in executive parking because of the success of the last few years, while the real incomes of non-management have been shrinking (due to inflation).  It is especially ironic considering inflation is being driving by the same thing that has been providing us with record revenues and profits: energy prices.\r\n\r\nCareer development is a new concept at Valero, unless you are in the executive development program, which is a detailed and extensive program.  If you are just a working class professional, your development options are limited to \"core competency\" courses stressing objectives that offer very little value to developing ones career or learning new skills.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, there has been an exodus of a large number of young, smart and hard working individuals to other companies.  This is because Valero's assets grew a lot faster than its ability to develop and recognize people.

Those people that you can count on, that take pride in their work and would ultimately just like to put in an honest day\u2019s work to earn a living, plain and simply aren't being appreciated. There is a good deal of favoritism shown to people that are truly lazy or just have poor work ethics because they know how to \"schmooze\" or kiss hindquarters. Alternatively, those people that show up every day on time and try to do their best seem to get no recognition at all. This has lead the Welcome facility to a point where a large number of the experienced staff are looking to move on or are being forced to move on; as they question management or are tired of being treated poorly by management because they know more about the position they hold than management themselves. They have tried and tried to move up based on merits, but this doesn\u2019t work as the \u201cschmoozers\u201d are really good at being \u2018Yes Men\u2019 and not thinking for themselves. The hard working employees have tried to make improvements to the everyday work life only to have it all demolished by those that really do not care or by poor choices made by management for which they never take credit. I have witnessed such things as a member of management making changes which produced wasted product and then they knowingly let someone else take the blame for the mistake. I have witnessed certain managers turn his/her cheek on a safety issue that he/she was involved in, but others are fired for much smaller issues by comparison.\r\nAlthough most people would choose to do right by the community and donate to a good cause; you will be forced to donate to the United Way and also to volunteer a certain number of hours the Valero only approved events each year.

Just keep an eye open for all of the job postings that come open over and over again and again. The amount of turnover should speak for itself.\r\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t not recommend applying for a job at this facility unless you have absolutely nothing in your background check and if you are the type of individual who would have nothing in your background check; you\u2019re too good to work here and will grow frustrated very quickly because of the things I\u2019ve mentioned above.

Since the store I was at already had an assistant manager, the manager would train me on his duties, as well. I loved it! There were no positions available for AM in any store near us, so I stayed as CSR, got better raises because of doing AM and SM tasks.", "cons": "Once I was relocated, I worked with one manager for a few months before he quit. It was unexpected. I was now \"Acting Manager\" for this store. I was fine with that, because it got me more experience. Once they hired a new manager, he quit, unexpectedly, after a few months. I talked to the Area Manager about training me to be a Manager for this store. He humored me for a bit. Then, the last SM came in. I ran the store for about 7 months total. When she ran the store, she started upsetting our regulars because she wasn't ordering correctly. I had worked with her multiple times trying to explain what our customers like. She told me \"I was brought in here to make this store better, because the girl running it couldn't cut it, so I'm going to do this my way.\" That was a direct attack at me. They only pay $7.35 when you are hired, and every 3 months you get a review done. The pay raises were: $0.05 for unsatisfactory (which required another review after 30 days. If it was still the same, you were let go), $0.10 for satisfactory, and $0.25 for above satisfactory (which was not to be given out unless you were doing what I did, which is be an AM without the AM pay and benefits). Once I did finally get my AM title, I got a $0.51 raise. Woo....$8.76 to be an assistant manager to a manager that refused to respond to employee's urgent calls, and refused to respond on the 2 occasions our store was broken into. I had to go up there, instead. I wouldn't have minded, but the whole time we are there, we have to be on the clock. Well, that put me into overtime, so I got yelled at for it. I got yelled at because the manager couldn't do her job, so I had to. Then, after finally getting that store in some sort of order, talking to customers and letting them know we were going through a change, basically begging them not to stop shopping with us, and doing everything I could to keep are customer base up; I get accused of stealing. I told them I was not stealing and I asked them to put a camera out where the theft was happening, so they could clear me, and they said it would cost too much. They refused to look at the fact that the theft began as soon as our new manager came in, and just kept saying I did it. For weeks, I fought with them on this. I finally gave up one day, though. I was having constant panic attacks before I worked here, but with everything they were saying about me and the fact that they wouldn't listen to me, it just made everything worse. I finally just walked in and tossed my keys over the counter and let the manager know I wouldn't be returning. I figure, there's no more room for advancement for me here. They think I'm a thief, and even though, I've done everything possible to show them that it wasn't me, they refused to look at anyone else."}, {"review_title": "Accounting manager", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Accounting Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free health care for you and dependents.
