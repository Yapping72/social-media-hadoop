Beautiful building at the NOV tower, where I worked (10353 Richmond Ave., Houston, TX 77042). Very good benefits, including a 401K plan with a company match. Even if you don\u2019t contribute to your 401K for the match, the company will still invest 2% of your salary on your behalf, with the company\u2019s own money. The company\u2019s large size provides the chance to transfer into new job opportunities not afforded at smaller companies.", "cons": "Because of the company\u2019s massive size, it\u2019s hit or miss when it comes to landing in a good department. I was hired a month before the O&G market dropped, so I worked in an environment of what seemed like constant change, company-wide as well as within my departments (layoffs, reorganizations, etc.). The company is made up of 3 different divisions that operate differently: Rig Systems, Wellbore Technologies, and Completion & Production Solutions (CAPS). I worked 2 different positions in CAPS and Rig Systems. Of the 2, I would say Rig was worse, probably the worst of the 3. The Rig division operates the most with a \u201cbottom line\u201d mentality, with little regard for its employees. It is also the division that provides the least amount of sick days (3 per year; CAPs provides 5 sick days per year). \r\n\r\nThe second department in which I worked (in the Rig division) was run with a \u201cdo more with less\u201d attitude. When I transferred to that department, there were always 4-5 members on my team. But when 2 team members left in the same month, that left only 2 of us to do all of the work. Upper management said we could manage fine with 2 people \u2013 wrong; my teammate and I grew tired, overworked & frustrated. On top of that, upper management was very stingy with overtime, despite our team being understaffed. We were promised a temp would be hired to help with research. That took 3 months to happen; 2 days before I resigned. In the 3 years that I worked at NOV, I learned many new skills, was \u201cpromoted\u201d with additional job duties and a fancier job title, but never received a raise. This was a common practice, particularly in the Rig division.  Another Rig employee was promoted to manager and given a lot of additional work with no pay raise; she resigned a few months later. I finally realized the only way I was ever going to receive a raise was through a new job at a new company, so I eventually found a new job. \r\n\r\nThe Rig department in which I worked had 16 employees. In the 16 months that I worked there, 10 people left; I was number 10. Some were fired, some resigned and 1 transferred, but it all adds up to a very high turnover rate for a department that size. My department also handled resignations rudely. When you put in your 2 weeks\u2019 notice, as I did, you are quickly escorted by your manager to HR to complete a quick exit review, after which you are escorted off the premises the same day \u2013 like a fired or laid off employee. The only difference is that they pay you for the 2 weeks\u2019 notice. Of all the numerous rules and policies that were discussed in that department, this practice was never mentioned. The other divisions don\u2019t handle resignations this way. Overall, I don\u2019t regret working for NOV, and there are better-run departments within the company. I do advise that if possible, try to find a job in the CAPS or Wellbore divisions."}, {"review_title": "Not the dream job your searching for.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "5 May 2018", "job_title": "Senior Field Service Technician in Tyler, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not many to share, met some great friends along the way.", "cons": "Management is horrible.

NOV is the good ol' boy network on steroids. I worked for them for quite a few years before I finally got fed up and left. I also got several advancements, so this is not a sour grapes review.\r\nNOV's customers absolutely hate them, and will go to any other vendor to try to get parts and supplies, given the chance. This means that NOV will eventually go out of business, if they get even a modicum of competition. They have avoided this by buying the competition, so far. The products are over-priced and under-supported.\r\nBasically, the business model of NOV is to acquire a top-of-the-line company, put its leadership into a VP slot, and run off the experienced (read: higher-paid) engineers and designers then hire folks off the street or from their circle of friends to be the management group. They then run that product into the ground until their customers look elsewhere. If \"elsewhere\" starts to get any market foothold, then NOV buys them and repeats the process.\r\nThis model cannot be sustained in the long run. I would expect to see NOV selling off assets when the next downturn happens in the oil patch. Their customers will buy elsewhere for less as soon as they have the time to shop around. Right now, there is no time to go elsewhere, so the \"one-stop-shop\" of NOV gets the whole bid. When money becomes on par with time for projects, NOV will lose out. When money is more valuable than time on projects, NOV will plummet in sales. It is just a matter of time.\r\nPart of the \"other\" this review asks for is the 6 month outlook. I selected \"down,\" but only for the long-term outlook. I don't know if the next downturn will be in 6 months or a year, or more, but I do know that the oil patch goes through cycles, and only well-liked and customer-oriented companies make it through the downturns intact.

Apparently, they can freely take away employees scheduled time off, but expect to be give substantial notice going the opposite direction.\r\n- I had an office / computer job and didn't have a computer for more than a week after starting.\r\n- I was told this was a 40 hour job in the interview, then found out it was REQUIRED 50 hours, and there were several weeks, I worked 60+. (I was only at this job for 3 and a half months)\r\n- Pay didn't reflect hours worked or job requirements. Not even close.\r\n- Computer equipment I did finally get was very poor, outdated, slow, and crashed constantly. Anytime I complained about it, I would get blamed.\r\n- Constantly mocked and watched over by managers\r\n- Many, many, MANY more..."}, {"review_title": "It's OK", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "7 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Account Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "NOV is a great place to work in Houston.

I knew going in they operated with something called a continental shift which was similar to a rotating 12 hour shift work I worked at other companies but the morning and night shifts were fixed and you worked 12 hour shifts.\r\n\r\nBut even though you worked 12 hours shifts, there was not a single cent of OT pay and what was worse, even when you worked on a statutory holiday, you still received regular pay and even worse yet, if you didn't work on a stat holiday, you didn't get paid at all because of the stat holiday pay qualification policy of the company and the way they were able to skirt the labour code. \r\n\r\nAnd if you're the hard working type, you'll always be picking up the slack for the lazy ones who just don't give a care doing as little as possible before they can get away with it and are only there to collect their paycheques.\r\n\r\nWhat was worse was that the management pushed the hard working guys all the time and left the lazy ones alone.  I've never worked in a place like that.\r\n\r\nWhat finally convinced me to leave that company hownever was during last christmas season when the workload was low due to the machine that feeds work to the rest of the department caught on fire all because of the management's neglect to properly maintain and clean the exhaust duct work periodically.  So, they forced everyone to stay home for 3 weeks without any pay before and after Christmas time.\r\n\r\nPlease read fairly.  To reiterate, all of us were forced to stay home without any pay because the management neglected to perform regular maintenance on a machine and it caught on fire.  This was not any of our fault and the blame fell entirely on the management.\r\n\r\nThe fire itself was on a scale for which the fire dept. should've been called. It required close to 10 full fire extinguishers to put the fire out.  Some guys just ran away while some of us held ground and hoped for the best while emptying one fire extinguisher after another.\r\n\r\nSo, when they forced us to stay at home, we were forced to use up all our holiday hours and of course for all of us that was nowhere enough for the hours lost from being forced to stay home, so we were just left without pay for all that time.  During the christmas time no less.\r\n\r\nYou just don't treat people like that.  And this is why the vast majority of the workers they hire are visible minorities whom they know will keep quiet no matter how unfair their labour practices are and will just take whatever the management does to them.\r\n\r\nIt's a place that will always try to screw the workers over as much as possible before they can get away with it.  All of us were always looking over our shoulders always worried what was next by the management to screw us over with.  The worker morale was always low there.\r\n\r\nThere's also a machine shop in that facility and from talking with some of the guys working there, things weren't that much different.  The hard working guys are always picked on and are always pushed harder while the lazy good for nothing idiots have it easy and good.  The morale with those guys also seemed pretty low too.\r\n\r\nAnd when I was there, they were always fearful that the continental shift will be forced upon them too.\r\n\r\nI'm sure NOV as a whole is a good company to work for.  They must be doing something right when they're a multinational, multibillion dollar company.  That's what attracted me to apply for a job with them in the first place.  But the 610 - 15 Avenue reline facility in Nisku is just one big joke of an operation.\r\n\r\nStay away from applying for any of the jobs there."}, {"review_title": "Major Management Overhaul desperately needed.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Aug 2012", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Sugar Land, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Decent benefits\r\n- Very good and talented co-workers below the management level.\r\n- Overtime opportunities\r\n- Pretty flexible when it comes to taking leave or family emergencies.", "cons": "* Im not sure about other facilities, just what Ive observed from this one over the years*\r\n- Notorious for lack of advancement opportunities. There are people here that truly do want to move up within the company but they either get sabatoged/blocked by their Supervisors or they just hire someone from the outside without any knowledge of the position.\r\n- \"Good ol boy\" system: There are many cases of favoritism and bias within the ranks. Its not what you know, but who you know. Management will hire friends or their friend's kids in positions they have no experience in.\r\n- Ultra low morale: The attitude on the floor is that there is zero incentive to go above and beyond and to just put in your 8 to 12 hours. There isnt any investment with the workers, if someone quits, they'll just hire people off the street for a low wage.\r\n- Low wages: This is the main reason that turn over is so high at this particular facility. There was a freeze on wages a couple years ago and there was chatter about bringing this facility up to other NOV's but that has not happened. Unfortunately, we've lost so many good people over the years from top to bottom because of this. In recent years, they cant even keep new hires and they will quit in short order.\r\n- Production over Safety: This is prolly the biggest problem Ive seen.  They claim safety trumps production but that is a farce. This is an aging facility from the 1960's-1970's with infrastructure that is outdated and obsolete. The machines on the floor are very old and are fixed to just get the job done. There are many machines in which the emergency brakes do not work, have improper guards, and heavily leak oil. They aquire machines and tools at the cheapest price/quality possible. OSHA would seriously have a field day with all the discrepancies and safety hazards here.

Which also gives chance to section heads to take actions feeling no accountability because simply said there is no closed loop feedback.\r\n\r\nEncouragement from higher management is based on who ever makes the most profit and the least cost regardless what lower management does to their employees, which causes lower management to stress their employees into very low salaries, no expenses almost and very few benefits or even much worse acting outside their job scope to satisfy their personal requirement. \r\n\r\nI joined the company and have not been told or shown any of my entitlements as an employee except after finding out from my fellow employees or ex-employees a few months later.
