There are tons of smart, experienced, and hard-working people here and there are plenty of opportunities to learn and develop skills. \r\n\r\nExxonMobil has a very organized and guided career development infrastructure for its employees, where supervisors and staffing & development advisors work together with employees to tailor work experiences and monitor skills development.\r\n\r\nCompensation is competitive for engineers. Non-Petroleum Engineering majors with a BS/MS can expect to receive a starting base salary 100k-110k. Petroleum Engineering majors start at ~120k. However, annual bonuses based on profit or company performance targets do not exist for entry-level employees. RSUs are not typically offered as part of compensation either. \r\n\r\nBenefits are good but are becoming less competitive. Decent medical and dental insurance options are available. As of September 2020, employees who work at the company for at least 5 years become invested in a pension plan. However, as of October 2020, the company is pausing its 7% 401k contribution match indefinitely.

At the heart of this is its infamous ranking system for assessing employee performance. \r\n\r\nRanking systems are commonly employed at large corporations to hold employees accountable and to effectively distinguish top performers for promotions. ExxonMobil's implementation of a ranking system is ineffective at doing either of these. \r\n\r\nThe insularity of how the performance reviews are conducted and what criteria are used to rank employees annually contributed to some incredibly toxic politics in the workplace. The company is comprised of bright, determined individuals, which can also mean highly competitive ones. In many cases, individuals would seek constantly to do what was most advantageous for themselves, rather than focusing on what was most critical for advancing a project or the team's cause. \r\n\r\nExxonMobil selects employees for promotion opportunities based on these rankings and performance reviews, and understandably, employees react to incentives for career advancement accordingly. \r\n\r\nFrom my personal experience, I was not impressed with the quality of senior leadership in the company. Many either struggled to or were unwilling to provide clarity about business objectives and strategic direction. They did not do much to foster camaraderie or even inspire. It is telling when you learn of breaking news concerning Exxon's business from news leaks more frequently than from within Exxon itself.\r\n\r\nThe outlook of the company isn't very bright either. I'd characterize it as a sinking Titanic, while other oil majors (CVX, RDS) seem more willing to embrace the changing industry, are making moves to keep their balance sheets flexible enough to pounce on acquisition opportunities, and have nurtured a much healthier internal work culture."}, {"review_title": "Amazing Campus with not so amazing staff", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Vendor Systems Managed Specialist in Spring, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "So many options available to you such as places to eat, coffee, pharmacy, dentist, eye care, and more \r\nWork flexibility \r\nPay \r\nTime off \r\nInsurance \r\nPension", "cons": "A lot of the the people are entitled and are not willing to help others grow and learn in fear of someone else besides themselves moving up. \r\nThe people who are close to retirement are no longer really working but mainly just keeping there chair warm until they can retire. \r\nThe training is minimal if any at all"}, {"review_title": "Overall recommend", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Research Scientist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "work life balance\r\nlot of resources to learn\r\ncoworkers are nice \r\ngood office environment", "cons": "sometimes process are lengthy to work with"}, {"review_title": "Excellent career development", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Have great opportunity to learn and grow.

In my 20 years career in XOM I had just few great managers who were developing their personnel. There is lots of politics and brown-nosing. Recent manager that I had was just thinking about how to promote herself and introduced inefficient and unnecessary initiative so it will look good on her performance. In general, XOM behind in implementing the latest technology (apart from core business, like engineering). My manager was afraid to implement technological efficiencies because it would require some extra access reviews to be done. It's like you shoot to the stars and she is still in the cave and doesn't want to go out. The other manager didn't even talk to his direct reports. We were wondering if he was fulfilling his responsibilities and what was going in the company. Although there are great managers who cares about personnel and develop them, if you're lucky, then you will do good and have fun at work. \nOne of the most disappointing thing about XOM is that management is lying a lot. Like recent layoff based on performance. Lots of people are getting assessed as \"need significant improvement\" on unreasonable grounds. Coworker has been told that his communication required significant improvement and what matters is \"...it's not what you do, it's how you do it\". Most people who have gotten bad performance reviews didn't see it coming, meaning that management was satisfied with their work the whole year. Who needs to work on their communication? $1M question. \nThe other important part is salary and benefits. XOM adds benefits like paternity leave, flex time because it's competitors introduced those and XOM was forced to do the same. Salary increase is minimum to none, company match gone (they are going to reinstate it back in October), health plan is expensive, 401K funds are low performers.

One of the biggest in the world and all time!\r\n- Free coffee, tea, and hot chocolate.\r\n- It can be a huge plus for your CV.\r\n- Training sessions are nice and you'll get free access to all the LinkedIn training.\r\n- Speaking different languages is welcomed.\r\n- Quite stable job and not stressful.\r\n- Your superiors are depending on your team because of the bad managerial of employee hiring. You can actually play with that. If they lose you, they will be in a very big mess. So never take seriously what they say when they want to pressure you.", "cons": "- Extremely huge corporate. You'll see that you are just an ordinary employee working in a small division that is already in a small division that is in a small division and so on.\r\n- You can't propose ideas for the company or the department you're working for because of that (it is the same for all huge companies like ExxonMobil).\r\n- Texan company means Texan mentality. They only care about money and how to spend less and this affects the employees and the managerial part in Prague. The Texas headquarter has a big influence on the managerial part of Prague.\r\n- You're seen as a number. Quality is not what they are looking for in this department. \r\n- The more productive you are, the more amount of workload they will give to you. Never do extra hours even if they tell you so.\r\n- Your supervisor's boss will tell you non-sense things to try to put you under pressure to do more. And this happens while you are still on your learning curve. \r\n- Showing appreciation by your superiors is non-existent.\r\n- You are not recognized at your proper value by your superiors.\r\n- Salaries are excessively low no matter the department and the seniority.\r\n- The job is not passionate and you'll always do the same thing.\r\n- Benefits are close to the depths of nothingness. You just have a very little amount of extra money but it is nothing. They used the pretext of the Corona pandemic to cut off all advantages and benefits. You won't get free languages courses, no massages, no office workouts, no fresh fruits in the office.\r\n- ExxonMobil doesn't pay any more for team buildings, dinners with your teammates, etc. (Corona apparently).\r\n- Extremely huge and wealthy company that acts like a poor one. \r\n- Many people are leaving ExxonMobil because of those things. \r\n- You'll notice many changes within your team. Most leave and superiors do nothing to compensate for this loss. That way, you'll be alone doing duties of 3-4 persons. There is a remarkable lack of employees but they hire no one. (To save money as usual).\r\n- You'll encounter people who are veterans in ExxonMobil, they worked for more than 10 years there and you'll keep wondering how is that possible.\r\n- The whole payables department in Prague is in a big mess except for some parts. They do absolutely nothing about it even though they need to hire people.\r\n- It is a department that you see working yourself for a maximum of 6 months. During that period, you'll notice envy to change company."}, {"review_title": "Great people, bad management", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Customer Account Specialist in Prague", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People, culture and constant improvement", "cons": "low salaries, terrible evaluation system"}, {"review_title": "Good job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Priest River, ID", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Secure emp loyment good people", "cons": "Hours and work life bala nce"}, {"review_title": "Great company once upon a time", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "28 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Geoscience Advisor in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Sakarya and benefits are very good.
