There are no PM, so developers are supposed to figure out feature specifications and support users directly, which can be time consuming, and it eats a good chunk of development time/effort\n\n- A lot of deadline. Things can sometimes get slow, but there are also a lot of stressful deadlines due to poor project management. Users of course do not understand how technology works, if you have a strong technical manager in your team maybe you can get support and push back, otherwise good luck\n\n- No system design. This company cares more about deliver speed instead of quality. This naturally leads to jumping in code very fast without fully understanding the need from users, and the proper technical design for it, which in return comes back to performance and affect the future development\n\n- Definitely not TDD\n\nThis is oil & gas company, so technology really is more of a support. If you just want stability then this is a great place for you, since they do not layoff full time employee, and the benefits are good.
