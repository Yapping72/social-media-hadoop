To start, the on-the-job training was superb. They don\u2019t just give you a three day rundown on the basics and throw you to the wolves, they make sure you are proficient and 100% comfortable with the job before putting you on your own, four weeks minimum of training. The equipment is excellent; the trucks are well maintained and are kept clean. The management team are good people. They treat you with respect and they are actively involved in the day to day operations; you see them regularly, and they always ask how things are going for you and if there is anything you need. The pay and insurance are both good, and it\u2019s only a four day work week, though you can almost always work extra days if you want to. The company also offers a pension and a 401k with one of the best company matches I\u2019ve ever seen. They also provide an annual bonus from 10-14% based on how well the company performed the previous year. Because of the company\u2019s performance last year, they even announced an additional bonus on top of the regular annual bonus, so they share their profits with their employees, which is really nice. The company is also very big on promoting from within. Once you\u2019ve been in your current position for two years, if there is another job within the company you\u2019re interested in, they\u2019ll send you to shadow someone who does that job to see if it\u2019s something you like, and if you decide you want the job, they\u2019ll give it to you. Most of the management team has come up in this way, which means that they\u2019ve done your job, which is nice because it almost always makes for a better manager because they\u2019ve been where you\u2019ve been and they know your job, so they\u2019re not detached from the realities of your day-to-day. This company goes out of its way to provide the best experience for their employees. Things like Sirius XM in all of the trucks, or giving their employees gift cards or hams for Christmas. They\u2019re not shy on feeding you, either; they buy lunch your entire first week of orientation, and cater food at monthly safety meetings, retirement parties, promotion parties, Christmas parties, etc. Even small things like, for example, if there is a certain pair of floor mats that you\u2019d like for your truck, they will order them for you.

If you live somewhere that this job is the only thing that pays you this well, MOVE.", "cons": "Where do I begin? Let's start with a typical day. Say it is Monday, you walk in at 0545 to clock in but your shift isnt until 0600, youre hit with a 3rd party driver loading on top of product and he/she is lying about what happened, you cant even have a sip of coffee yet , you are trying to prioritize all the stuff this company has you do for such a common mistake, you take care of this driver and realize that youre just a few minutes into your shift and your blood pressure is already up, then your manager walks in and he/she is in a crappy mood because they work monday through friday 9-5 and get paid salary and much more than you......boohoo. A year in and you wonder why manager positions even exist as they have nothing but time to make your work day miserable . Literally all they do is try to fill the schedule in when someone is sick or taking vacation. Which brings me to the first hour of the day. Your manager asks you if you can work a shift or be on call all week and weekend because your coworker is off for whatever reason. You had plans as it is one of the few weeks you actually have off. You tell the manager you need to talk it over with your family and they look at you like you just spit in their face. It is now 2 hours into your shift. Time to go do something physical like hook up railcars in the sun and its nearing 100 degrees. You wonder where so and so is. Well, so and so isnt EVER out there to pitch in help. Why? Because he is entitled. Thats right. Marathon isnt union. However, from personal experience, they do practice seniority. I, myself, have sat in the manager's office with a former coworker talking about how he said he feels he doesnt have to physically gauge a tank because he has seniority. What came of this? Me and the other operator found ourselves gauging all of the terminal's tanks. Fast forward to lunch time. You are sitting there trying to eat but literally every day some truck driver comes in the lunch room and needs something. I have worked here over a decade........3/4 the time my lunch is interrupted. Here is my experience with pay raises: First year I started trainee pay , I was given a year to be evaluated. Where I was at the time had me and one other operator and tone of the most infamous managers the company has. He put me on call with basically zero experience first month and wrote me up any time I made the most minimal error and trust me I made plenty because I was doing 99 % of the work thanks to the other operator sitting on his phone and not training me. He yelled at me with doors closed like I was a child and coworkers and truck drivers told me they wouldnt put up with it. Funny enough every one of them put up with it just alike. Why? Because we all needed a job. Why isnt he fired? Because once youre a manager youre in a club. Might as well quit instead of working for them because if you go to HR and upper management they just allow the manager to push back on you. I have caught the flu, I have caught covid, I have had multiple family members die and have to go back home to bury them.....every time I was treated with disrespect. I called to confirm I had the flu and this manager sighed and hung up on me. Same manager told me I needed to tell him when I was goin to return to work cause he had a business to run when I informed him that a family member died. HR and upper management listened to me go off about this and did absolutely nothing. This manager doesnt deserve to be a manager at a dollar general. If you are a younger guy I would definitely stay away from this job. You will only be subjected to listening to boomers complain about how you don't work when you are in fact working laps around them and pulling way more shifts. When covid happened there were tons of employees taking advantage of having a symptom and getting 10 days off paid. So now year 2022 we lost 3 months off sick with full pay and we only get 14 days off even with covid. The company is getting worse and worse and let me tell you something about a skeleton crew. I have worked this field a baker's dozen years and about 10 of those years my terminal has been ran short staffed. If youre dumb enough to apply after reading this, ask to see a work schedule during the interview , then ask them to explain how they would work it out if one person were to quit or get fired. What's bad is that they hire people that ARE good workers but dont have a college education at first. You look at the schedule and lie to yourself that it isnt miserable because truly it isnt THAT bad fully staffed. Well the inevitable happens and someone is off for a surgery for 3 months or someone quits or someone gets fired. Then all of a sudden you find yourself working your entire life away. I cannot tell you how many times I have worked a full 10 or 12 hour shift during a weekday and had to go home and try to sleep a few hours only to wake back up at 2300 to get back to work to work another 10 or 12 hour shift on only a few hours of sleep. Then you get off of that shift and get home and blow past your wife and kids and shower and try to sleep during the day. How is that healthy!?!?!?!? When someone gets fired or quits ohhhhhhh boy you better just look to work like that a good 6-8 months because THIS company takes FOREVER hiring someone. They usually wont except someone within the company either. They will hire someone off the street or just a driver that has hardly any knowledge on how to do our job and it takes 3 months just to get this person in the door. THEN they need trained before they release them on call. So those 6-8 months as they try to fill in that position you are fighting other coworkers on who gets to be on call and work pipeline or vessels all day and night, work weekends, work holidays, be on call, etc.. Dont feel safe with this company either as they are selling one of the top performing terminals to another company without pension. Why not move up in this company? Because you will just live on the road. Every position other than operations has you living on the road so might as well get a divorce. The only people that truly love this job are those that are in the club. You will see a lot of people with their sons managing better and better terminals."}, {"review_title": "Overall a good company to work for", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Aug 2022", "job_title": "IT Technical Specialist in San Antonio, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Had several good manager that I worked for", "cons": "Had 1 bad manager that left before I did.

They discriminate against minorities even though they are qualified to do the same job as their majority counterparts. Everyone has their own agenda and think that their issues are more important than yours.  High stress from multiple projects at all at once and very little staff to monitor them.  Terrible coordination between projects as project leaders who literally office on the same floor do not talk to each other.  They tie up employees times by asking the same question through multiple project leaders.  Way too much computer based training and it's all C.Y.A for the company.  Way too much FTMS designed to make sure you don't have a moment of free time to care about anything else. The project work and contractors who work there have priority over the employees when it comes to getting the project done quicker.  Forget about having an actual weekend because the project is more important than your personal time!  They overreact when it comes to preventing a mistake from reoccurring.  Instead of offering help and training to the place where the problem occurred the entire division has adhere to drastic and unnecessary evasive actions. They harp about safety yet commit safety violations regularly.  Tanks are brought back online even though they are missing several key items from an API653 service.  Rules, procedures and policies only apply when there isn't money at stake. If you were part of a take over from another company you will always feel like an outsider who can't possibly know what they know.
