In the oil and gas industry, Apache is known as a company that expects a lot of its employees, but rewards them for it.  The bonus structure is phenomenal compared to other companies in this industry.\r\nPerhaps the best part of working for Apache is that it is big enough to participate in large, technologically advanced projects that are cutting edge, but also small enough to be incredibly agile when it comes to moving forward on projects and navigating the often complicated world of oil and gas.  At Apache you will see projects moving from start to finish under your watch - that is something my peers at other companies do not often get to experience.", "cons": "The main downside at working for Apache is that it demands far more from its employees than other companies.  At Apache you are expected to do more as an individual - although team concepts are evolving there are still many times when you will have to work in many diverse fields on one project.  At other companies you might have 5-6 people working a project, whereas at Apache you would only have 2-3 for a project of similar scope.\r\nThis leads to what I see as being the biggest downside of working at Apache as a technical expert.

Each department has their own culture, as I am sure is normal. However stay away from corporate land. It is where employees at Apache go to die in their souls. All of the department managers allow 1 single girl to run the department based on her opinions, with only 6 years experience in oil and gas mind you. And if she doesn't like you, start saving your money because she will start a file on you to justify getting rid of you even if there is no justification. \nApache is very behind in the times as far as making it a fun place to work. They used to be good about this until around 2013 and it all went downhill.\nOil and gas is cyclical and you are subject to the whims of the stock market price. The company as a whole is doing better staying on a steady path since they switched the CEO. However, G&A is the first thing to get cut when they're trying to cut costs. Employees are just a number on a page, nothing your going to do or say is going to matter.
