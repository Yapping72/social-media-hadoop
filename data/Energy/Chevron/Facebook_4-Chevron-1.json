Entry-level pay is strong versus competitors, the work is challenging, and developmental opportunities are robust. In fact, the executives themselves managed to climb the ladder from the ranks of the engineers so theoretically you can make it to the very top. Employee investment is very front-loaded towards new hires, both in terms of technical training as well as business acumen training.\r\n\r\nBonuses are good at Chevron and there's still a pension which is increasingly atypical of employers these days.\r\n\r\nThere are opportunities to develop skills which are valuable outside of Chevron. Take advantage of these. The Data Science and Lean Sigma programs are very underutilized and can make you valuable outside the lumbering dinosaur of Oil & Gas.", "cons": "Weak opportunities for non-engineers. If you aren't an engineer, expect to spend your career mostly in the same place and at best climbing the ladder only one or two rungs.\r\n\r\nRepeated relocations are expected for anyone who wants to climb the ladder. If you are married to someone gainfully employed outside Chevron or are otherwise not positioned to relocate every few years, you'll go nowhere in the long-run. The saying is: \"If you don't move, you don't matter\".\r\n\r\nOnce you reach mid-career, the opportunities become very limited. Training and development is not really intended to help you. If you haven't been flagged as \"high potential\" (rare!) then you'll probably stagnate in your current position or within a narrow set of positions.\r\n\r\nThere is no means for asking for a raise. You'll get 3% to 6% in terms of an annual pay increase, most of which is determined by corporate performance rather than your own. This often makes it worthwhile for employees with more than 5 years experience to go elsewhere if the pay increase is substantial or if they're confident in their talents.\r\n\r\nUnder CEO Mike Wirth, Chevron has gone all-in on \"woke\" politics, in an especially ham-fisted way.

This is not just about the amount you are paid, but the fact that you are less likely to be considered for other roles within the company with higher PSGs, because it appears that you are not qualified, due to your current PSG being comparatively low.  Even if you do manage to get a role that is a much higher PSG (say 3 or 4 levels above your current PSG), a role that actually reflects your level of responsibility, perhaps because your future manager knows your capability, you will not ever progress more than 1 PSG every few years.

Upstream is a whole different world.\r\n\r\n1. Chevron offers excellent compensation and benefits, including a very generous 401-K match and a defined benefit pension.  Relocation benefits for new employees and relocating existing employees are best-in-class, but are not quite as generous as they once were.  Mid-career new hires receive a level-appropriate vacation day allowance.\r\n\r\n2. Good work-life balance (e.g., most locations, including San Ramon headquarters, feature a \"9-80\" schedule whereby you have every second Friday or Monday off assuming you've logged 80 hours over the other 9 days in that 2-week period).  Pretty loose ship in terms of if you need to leave early, go to dentist, etc.  Some people abuse it though (particularly \"9-80\" days), and this can be annoying if the abuser is a member of a project team with you.\r\n\r\n3. The company invests in training; a great deal of training opportunity is available, and employees have a large say in choosing the training that is appropriate for their goals.\r\n\r\n4. There is a lot of opportunity to broaden your horizons  . . . over the course of a career, you could find yourself straying quite far from your educational or professional background (though this may be good or bad depending on your career objectives).\r\n\r\n5. Explorers may enjoy working at CVX owing to the opportunity to travel or work in exotic locations around the world (depending on the nature of your position) . . . though there has been significant belt-tightening lately with respect to travel and expatriate assignments.\r\n\r\n6. .CVX is NOT a hypercompetitive, dog-eat-dog, sabotage-prone kind of environment like XOM (or many other big companies) is purported to be.  You rarely see deliberate attempts to embarrass others at meetings.\r\n\r\n7. People are generally friendly . . . senior-most executives greet even \"low ranking\" employees by name.\r\n\r\n8. Management is quite forthcoming with sharing information.\r\n\r\n9. While some will always complain, IT support is actually pretty good.", "cons": "My review pertains only to the \"Downstream\" part of the business.  Upstream is a whole different world.\r\n\r\n1. Job security is NOT what you might think it would be in the oil business.  There are frequent reorganizations and downsizings in the Downstream and in \"support functions\".  If you care about long term employment stability, be careful about working at Chevron if you are in a discipline that is not core to the day-to-day operations of the company . . . there is a tendency for there to be \"flavors of the year\" in the various business units as leaders come and go . . . e.g., emphasis on being \"Marketing led\" this year, \"Procurement led\" the next, and \"Logistics led\" the next . . . and as these flavors come and go, there is upsizing and downsizing accordingly within these disciplines.\r\n\r\n2. It is almost impossible to get important decisions made; upper-middle managers seem to be rewarded for NOT making risky decisions, so they waffle and stall rather than take action.  On any given relatively straightforward project, there will be a way-too-big project team, a way-too-big group of decision makers, endless meetings, and endless revision & recycling of PowerPoint documents for internal consumption.\r\n\r\n3. Physical office space is not the greatest . . . main campus buildings in San Ramon are dark and cluttered. . . Houston's offices are sterile and inorganic.\r\n\r\n4. While safety must be paramount in operations and field settings, there is an obnoxious and irritating emphasis on personal safety even for office workers.  Of course one wants one's employer to be concerned with your health and well-being, but at Chevron it goes over the top to a level of pure ridiculousness.  All meetings start with \"safety moments\" that can go on and on . . . all office-based employees write annual \"safety commitments\" which are posted on their office doors . . . there are office ergonomic inspections . . . mandatory use of ergonomic software that enforces breaks that'll pop up at inopportune times . . . an idiotic and insane and cumbersome \"Loss Prevention System\" where there is a formalized process to assess adherence to safety procedures for such matters as \"heating food in the microwave\" to \"walking to your car\" . . .  If only the shareholders knew how much time was wasted on such pursuits!\r\n\r\n5. As in any large corporation, there is definitely favoritism not rooted in meritorious performance.  Certain \"favored children\" are deemed to be incapable of doing any wrong and are put on the fast track; certain individuals treat their subordinates inappropriately but senior management is either unknowing or oblivious because these same individuals \"manage up\" very well.  When a \"level 2\" manager is assessing performance of a \"lower level\" manager, subordinates of the lower level manager are seldom approached for feedback.\r\n\r\n6. Outcomes of performance reviews (done through \"forced ranking\" sessions amongst managers at each level in the hierarchy) are often as much (or more) dependent on the supervisor (i.e., his or her personality, status, reputation, forcefulness, persuasive ability) than on the employee.\r\n\r\n7.

One person may be paid $100k to do a job, get back filled by someone making $150k (cause that's what they made previously), and then the next person in the role may only earn $90k. I've seen it happen countless times. It doesn't matter how qualified you are to do a particular job, if you haven't locked in the next PSG you don't get paid more to do higher level jobs.
