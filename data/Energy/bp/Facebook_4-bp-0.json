There are a lot of good ideas floating around but the culture is too risk averse to be able to put things into action at the moment.\r\nAlthough one of the aims of the re-org was to flatten out bp's hierarchy this has not been the reality and it seems like crucial decisions are being held in the hands of people who are too busy to understand the decision in order to make it. Currently it seems a little like junior level staff are being blamed for the consequences of inactivity and indecision at a senior level and that no one is holding these leaders to account. Career progression is very difficult and the barriers to progress don't seem like they'll be removed any time soon. A standard attitude that is held by staff is that you have to leave bp to progress in your career in order to return to the company at a more senior level which is obviously demotivating and reduces desire to remain at the company. Work activity is often set on what one leader has mentioned offhandedly in a meeting which results in a considerable waste of effort. This is due to attempting to address one concern without properly understanding its basis and then having to pivot to work on a different poorly detailed concern that was raised at another meeting. Agile has been implemented in an incomplete manner. It is expected that employees will work in line with an Agile methodology but there is no acceptance at a senior level to work to deliver an MVP and then iterate. It is expected that any solution should be perfect from release and this results in delays of multiple years for the release of solutions that are highly urgent to improve employee experience and retention."}, {"review_title": "Nice job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Mechanical Technician in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some good people work here", "cons": "Company has a bad reputation"}, {"review_title": "Bp", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative (CSR) in Palmerston North, Manawatu-Wanganui", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Its a job i guess", "cons": "Always asking to work, like was always under staffed, it was a problem to me because i am a student"}, {"review_title": "Great strategy and culture - sometimes just too much red tape", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "8 Feb 2023", "job_title": "P C Manager/Purchasing Manager in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Really supportive Managers.

Perhaps this was out of an abundance of caution or to go above and beyond to leave no stone unturned and prevent further government action against them (sounds familiar from the last few years). I do know this resulted in every employee being forced to come up with a new way to reinvent the wheel every year and document you had done so - even if the wheel did not need reinventing and current processes were working very well. It was a very intense, often-pointless project that often made it very challenging to satisfactorily perform regular role responsibilities. This was all started as a save-face to appease the government after the very-tragic oil spill in 2010 but there seemed to be very little concern about the impact on the employee's morale and ability to perform well. IMHO, the leadership could have designed these new compliance requirements in a way that was more manageable for each employee in light of the already-high requirements of completing our daily job deliverables. I get it. As we've seen with Covid responses, etc, it's human nature to want to overreact without considering impacts on all sides using a cost/benefit balancing test.

And Managers asked to find job outside. HR don't play any role here, they just follow managers calls.\r\n\r\n- Every Manager is given target to reduce cost by 30% every year at any cost. So managers push to do Automation which is there first priority now. Any process Exclation is not that bic problem but no Automation is problem here. By following this cost cutting that means out of 1500 employees they will fire 450 people.\r\n\r\n- Last year they hire people by saying that you will get monthlt allowance apart from salary of 7350 P.M. but this year they closed that policy as well to have cost cutting. Several resignations are going on here which is also there plan of cost cutting.\r\n\r\n- At time of induction they show that BP follow Work life balance, Employees Safety, Health first. But at ground level you see, employees are working 15hr a day and management really don't care about it. Policies are just on papers not practical.\r\n\r\n- Initially they hired good employees by showing good faces and values but after 6 month, once transition is over. They treat us like labours just because they what employees should resign and they can save cost.\r\n\r\nApart from this, work environment is very demotivating, daily you see people crying that they are asked to leave by manager. So you also feel demotivated and don't feel like to work.\r\nThink before you join BP GBS Pune center, today or tomorrow your job will be at risk.

What this means is that your job will constantly change, it will constantly be designed and re-designed by people who lack experience in the roles and do not have endure the consequences of their decisions, and you will always be at risk of being laid off. I doubt you will ever have a feeling of job security, and because of that, your personal relationships and happiness will likely suffer. Believe me when I say that you do not want to work here. You will have a better career and better life elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe third and final thing that you should be aware of is that BP is excellent at saying no.
