In most UK locations you get a free lunch and subsidised or free gym membership.  \r\n\r\nThe people who work here are generally bright and interesting to work with, although this does not necessarily mean that they are good at running a business - there is a tendency to overcomplicate things.  However, it does mean that the work tends to be intellectually stimulating (although not always - see below!).  Again, though, I think that increasingly this is no longer the case - I don't think that BP necessarily attracts the best anymore. \r\n\r\nThere is potential to move across the business and locations, although getting this realised can be difficult.  More often that not, it is a case of which job is available at the time that you are looking, and there is an increasing emphasis on gaining depth in an area rather than broadening your experience.  This means that increasingly it can be difficult to get out of an area once you have worked there for a while.", "cons": "There is poor recognition of good performance.  This is particularly the case for theose on the graduate scheme where you see no promotion and minimal salary increases for three years, no matter how well you perform and how good this performance is relative to your peers.  Beyond this time horizon, many people seem to stagnate into their positions and find it difficult to make headway.  \r\n\r\nMany people have been employed by the company for a long long time and have never worked anywhere else.  This can make it quite claustrophobic and inward looking place to work.  It also means that as a newcomer, it can be difficult to make headway.  However, I do think that this is less of a problem than it used to be.\r\n\r\nBenefits, although relatively good, are being cut back on.  The best example of this is the scaling back of the compressed working week arrangement by which you  were allowed every other Friday off in return for working longer hours during the preceeding nine days.  There is no health insurance provision in the UK (although you get discounts on private health insurance) or dental insurance (although this is subsidised in some locations - this disparity is somewhat unfair).  Salaries are below the market rate in teh areas that I am familiar with (Finance, Subsurface) and the benefits do not compensate adequately for this.  Holiday allowance is pretty much on a par with other companies in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe company is slow to move, and often misses out on opportunities because of this.  Proposed activities are analysed to death and are then subjected to round of approval after round of approval.  There have been reorganisations to try and combat this, the effects seem to be slow in coming but I do think that things are improving.  This makes it a frustrating place to work in many ways.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly, work has involved checking data, producing reports, reconciling sets of information, making presentations, putting numbers into spreadsheets.

How is this allowed to go on?\"\r\nFirst and foremost, the company culture is extremely resistant to change. In most companies, metrics are used to measure progress towards a goal. At BP, the metrics are the goal.  This was the fundamental issue at Deepwater - where employees were pressured to keep quiet about safety concerns (survivors later testified about this to Congress) so as to make the KPI (key performance indicators) look good.  This tradition is alive and well at Whiting, where all attempts to improve safety, morale, and efficiency are met with managerial or HR obstruction.  The \"post hoc fallacy\" is essentially the office slogan, as management will attribute the causes of momentary drops in hand-injuries or slips/falls on safety initiatives, when in reality its just the law of averages, and if they're down one month, they'll rise the next.  At one point, the refinery was becoming so dangerous that a refinery-wide \"safety suggestion\" meeting was held, where employees were permitted to offer suggestions on ways to reduce hazards. Every suggestion was shot down, even those that are performed as industry norms or are common at other oil/chemical refineries.  Instead, the supervisors pushed the solution of stronger metrics.  No attempts are ever made to change the safety culture.\r\nIf you have the misfortune of knowing BP Whiting's HR department, you'll understand why this is.  Like most businesses, all BP locations have a \"speak-up line\", where you can call to report harassment, threats, health/safety/environmental concerns.  The company freely admits that BP Whiting is the #1 source of speak-up calls.  When I first started working there, a veteran employee pulled me aside and stated outright that if I call the speak-up line, I would be fired.  There is a long history of employees calling the speak-up line to report harassment by their managers, after which the manager would work in conjunction with HR to terminate the employee.  That's not conjecture or guesswork - it's verifiable. This policy ends up breeding an extremely toxic environment, where some managers have full leave to harass and scream vitriol at their subordinates, berate them loudly and aggressively in front of others, and abuse their ability to assign workload well over 40 hours per week (heck, I've seen certain managers assign 75 hours/week worth of work to individuals).  Remember, at BP Whiting, HR always looks the other way when management engages in unprofessional behavior.  There are department supervisors/managers who have remained in the same position for literally decades, all the while presiding over teams that suffer consistent 15-20% annual turnover to get away from them.  There are departments with 10-20 people in them, where no one has been there for more than 5 years as people are more apt to walk away from the money/insurance/pension in order to achieve peace of mind and get away from harassment.  How the HR employees are able to collect a paycheck and not be paralyzed by guilt or embarrassment is beyond my understanding.  In any case, only two types of people can flourish in such a culture: sociopathic bullies and people who are just \"going through the motions\" and have given up any sense of ambition.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering working here, know this: Every year, dozens of employees walk away from very attractive pensions and salaries in favor of finding a professional environment to work at.

I told her I was going to report the case to Open Talk. She advised me not to do so. I could potentially be the one to blame and very likely my career would be jeopardized. The line manager would be the winner in this case.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, flexible work arrangements \u2013 this one is really a joke. Most departments/areas promote flexibility at work but that is nothing but propaganda. You may be able to work from home to fulfill requirements of your role to deal with teams overseas; however, you must be in the office Mon through Fri, so your line manager can see you. \r\n\r\nAfter seeing/experiencing all this, it is definitely time to put a \u201cfull stop\u201d in my career at BP."}, {"review_title": "BP Company Revie", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Sales Associate/Cashier in Union, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly environment and no shortage of hours typically.

The development review process is often used by bullying supervisors and managers in their favour - it takes a very sharp and exceptionally non-naive employee to make sure they can a) spot dishonesty in their managers comments and appraisal, and b) document the heck out of everything they do and use it to their advantage in the development review process.

Still now, I believe BP is a great company, and the reason I joined was because its 5 core value aligned with mine. However, after being in the company for several months, I am more than disappointed and frustrated, especially for the China  business. The reasons are as following: \r\n\t1. I have totally different job responsibilities from what was wrote in their hiring website / from what HR told me during interview and what I'm doing now. To protect my privacy, I will not enclose the details. All I can say is that I thought I would take important responsibilities and get engaged in the business meetings to support the organization (what's been communicated during interview and in their hiring job description), and what I am doing now is very operational and administrative like sorting files and subscribing newspaper for the team.  This's not my own opinion, most challengers have the same feelings that our jobs are more like interns' and contractors' job responsibilities. \r\n\t2. I don\u2019t see BP 5 core value other than safety in the organization. I can't tell if it is the same thing in the business (because my job is too administrative to touch the core business), but that's how I overall feel in the organization: very little respect, excellence and courage. Here's why:  a demand planning manager asked me to help with some data analysis, and this ended up at she yelling at me for being \"stupid\" not to get it right the first time. My buddy, who's supposed to orient me in the organization, told everyone that I was not busy at all and asked them to give what they don\u2019t want to do (like making a video) to me and called those \"a learning opportunity\".  The organization doesn\u2019t welcome new ideas to excellence. I've talked to the big boss about how I feel about my administrative job and my willingness to do more and support the business. He didn\u2019t listen to my ideas and instead, told me my ideas were ridiculous and suggested that questions I should thought about as a challenger needed to be all about what I can give to the company. He thought it's ashamed and unhealthy that I was asking the company for something. I feel very bad that people at that level doesn\u2019t understand mutual growth of the company and employees (I thought that's the purpose of the challenger program). Upon those situations, I don\u2019t have courage to speak out my real thoughts and my ideas. \r\n\t3. I am tired of hearing how important challengers are to the organization and how much attention or privilege challengers have from the organization. Besides BP's online orientation, challengers don\u2019t have any orientations on the business products or local business structure.  I am not familiar with products this local team handles at all. A more than reasonable numbers of challengers have left during their rotations with same concerns and disappointment as I have (another main reason was the low salary), we have had presented the situation with comparison of salaries and job responsibilities with other companies to the HR team, but the organization had done nothing.  Some functions don\u2019t accept challengers because they think challengers just stay for a year and will go eventually. \r\nOverall, I feel extremely unmotivated working in the organization in China as a challenger. And the reason I post this here is because I want to raise awareness to people who are thinking about BP's FLP Future Leadership Program, which have one local rotation and one overseas rotation -  China is NOT a good choice."}, {"review_title": "Great company needs some tweaks", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "16 Feb 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance\r\nGreat benefits\r\nPeople Genuine care", "cons": "Indecision at the top at times\r\nMessage from below not filtered up to decision makers\r\nGroup think"}, {"review_title": "BPL48 does not equal BP", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "28 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Engineer in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice offices, front line employees are great, flat organization, large resource base, relocating to Denver, Resource development is a high priority.", "cons": "BPL48 is still acting like gas is <$1/MCFD and <$30/bbl, cutting people and safety processes.
